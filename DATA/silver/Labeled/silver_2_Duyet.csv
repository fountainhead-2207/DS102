0,Cryptonomicon,Neal Stephenson,1999,2002,"Cryptonomicon zooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods--World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. ""When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty--we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.""
All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes--inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe--team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.",Children,Excellent,3,12,15,14.0,14,4.25,73962,5.0,"Numero uno for me; I've read it several times.

Her Uncle Fred has disappeared. A body turns up in a garbage bag. She's got a nasty bookie following her around town. Grandma Mazur has her hands on the stun gun.

 And I *should* be the target audience for this. I love multi-generational epics. I've read more Michener than I care to recall, and enjoyed every minute of it. Stephenson gets the math right (and the code)-- which is really refreshing. There's plenty of intrigue, and enough plot undulation to keep you engaged (although the denouement is perhaps longer than strictly speaking necessary). 
 But, in Stephenson's world, women exist solely as vehicles for men's sexual climaxes which then free their minds and energy to do their work-- usually some cryptological advance or saving the world. Academics exist only to police people for daring to tell the truth and dissent vocally, litigation exists only so that less brilliant (but ruthless) people can mooch off of the brilliant few- the makers/producers- basically, the entire modern plotline could be cribbed from the more insufferable works of Ayn Rand. It's telling that we have a sympathetic Nazi but no sympathetic academics or lawyers. Don't even get me started on the gun-toting hackers. 
 These things took me out of the story regularly and abruptly enough that it made the book a slog. I skimmed any passage concerning Charlene because I knew I would find it at best annoying and more likely infuriating.

 Neal Stephenson has written an overlong novel focusing on the significance of cryptography both in the world today and the time of World War II. He links the two by using multiple family generations. The predecessors inhabit the early cryptographical universe of Turing and others, dealing with cracking German and Japanese cyphers. The latter family representatives are trying to develop a secure cryptography that will support the creation of a global monetary system, based on gold stashed in the Philippines near the end of the war. 
 Neal Stephenson - from the LA Times 
 Stephenson provides considerable payload here, providing details of cryptography then and now, and considerable analysis of gold as the basis for economic structures. He also tells us much about how business is done when global actors are creating the information economies of the future. 
 There is no shortage of action here. But it is at the expense of character development. To the extent that the players have an inner life, it is radically overshadowed by the external events in which they are involved. The female characters are barely explored here, hardly more than window dressing to the experiences of the men, with considerable emphasis on their looks. This was unwelcome. 
 Still, I enjoyed the book. It is an engaging read, and worth the trip for the information it conveys.

 Carina Adams, where have you been all my life? This story! These characters! The banter! The sex! I loved it all! I am seriously kicking myself, because this is the first book I have ever read by this author. Why book friends? Why were you guys holding out me?! I am so glad that I finally discovered her, and this awesome story! (No thanks to my ""friends."") 
 Lucien Chance a.k.a. Lucky, a local college football star, is at work when a beautiful blonde catches his eye. Sunny is looking to have one night of fun before she starts over with a new job and a new life. As the evening progresses, Lucky begins to look more and more like the good time she wants to have. Before long, she is agreeing to go back to his place where they spend the entire night having the most amazing sex of their lives. One night is all it was supposed to be, but when it's over, they can't stop thinking about each other. 
 Since Lucky neglected to get Sunny's phone number, he hopes to run into her at the bar where he works again so they can go for round two. Unfortunately for him, that never happens. Instead, he finds her in the most surprising place imaginable...his Org Behavior class. It turns out that Sunny is actually Emerson Bernard, his new professor. 
 Lucky is pretty sure banging his teacher will be frowned upon by the university, and Sunny concurs, so they agree to one last hurrah. As you can probably guess, that wasn't enough for them. Meeting in secret at each other's apartment becomes a regular occurrence. Lucky and Sunny can't keep their hands off of each other. Soon, it's obvious that their connection goes beyond just a physical attraction, but continuing on with their relationship could be detrimental to them both. He could have his scholarship revoked and be kicked off the team while Emerson could lose her job. There is no denying their growing feelings, but is that enough to risk it all? 
 Lucky was such a pleasant surprise! It completely exceeded my expectations. The writing is addictive and engaging. I never wanted to put the book down! The romance is sweet, forbidden, and HOT! Those sex scenes are no joke! All I can say is, I think the author has a lot of fun in her personal life. ;) That being said, I didn't just love the steamy scenes between Lucky and Sunny. I enjoyed all of the moments they spent together. In fact, the times when they opened up to one another, teased each other, went to visit his family, and just hung out were the times I felt their connection the most. 
 Lucky! That man had me swooning all over the place. He is pretty fantastic, and if Sunny didn't want him, I would gladly take him off her hands! Usually, the football player in romance novels is always a manwhore that only finally settles down when he meets the heroine. That is not the case here. Lucky is a one woman man. He is thoughtful, protective, generous, a monster in the bedroom, and an incredible athlete. What I loved most about him was his spectacularly filthy mouth. If dirty talkers are your thing, read this one asap! The cool thing is that in this story, it's not just the hero that has a dirty mouth. Sunny could make a biker blush with her colorful commentary, and I floved her for it! She is a sarcastic, sassy, smart, strong woman, in other words, everything I want in a heroine. 
 Why not five stars? I would have liked a little more about what happened to Lucky and his family. It was talked about a lot, but not enough details were given for my liking. Other than that, I adored everything about this book! 
 All in all, Lucky is a phenomenal forbidden romance that will make you smile, blush, fan yourself a time or two, and tear up when you least suspect it. I recommend this to fans of sports romance and forbidden romance. Hell, if you enjoy romantic books period, read it! This is a good one people! Don't say I never told you! Now, go add it to your tbr! Buy it! Read it! You won't be sorry!

 Lucky is pretty sure banging his teacher will be frowned upon by the university, and Sunny concurs, so they agree to one last hurrah. As you can probably guess, that wasn't enough for them. Meeting in secret at each other's apartment becomes a regular occurrence. Lucky and Sunny can't keep their hands off of each other. Soon, it's obvious that their connection goes beyond just a physical attraction, but continuing on with their relationship could be detrimental to them both. He could have his scholarship revoked and be kicked off the team while Emerson could lose her job. There is no denying their growing feelings, but is that enough to risk it all? 
 Lucky was such a pleasant surprise! It completely exceeded my expectations. The writing is addictive and engaging. I never wanted to put the book down! The romance is sweet, forbidden, and HOT! Those sex scenes are no joke! All I can say is, I think the author has a lot of fun in her personal life. ;) That being said, I didn't just love the steamy scenes between Lucky and Sunny. I enjoyed all of the moments they spent together. In fact, the times when they opened up to one another, teased each other, went to visit his family, and just hung out were the times I felt their connection the most. 
 Lucky! That man had me swooning all over the place. He is pretty fantastic, and if Sunny didn't want him, I would gladly take him off her hands! Usually, the football player in romance novels is always a manwhore that only finally settles down when he meets the heroine. That is not the case here. Lucky is a one woman man. He is thoughtful, protective, generous, a monster in the bedroom, and an incredible athlete. What I loved most about him was his spectacularly filthy mouth. If dirty talkers are your thing, read this one asap! The cool thing is that in this story, it's not just the hero that has a dirty mouth. Sunny could make a biker blush with her colorful commentary, and I floved her for it! She is a sarcastic, sassy, smart, strong woman, in other words, everything I want in a heroine. 
 Why not five stars? I would have liked a little more about what happened to Lucky and his family. It was talked about a lot, but not enough details were given for my liking. Other than that, I adored everything about this book! 
 All in all, Lucky is a phenomenal forbidden romance that will make you smile, blush, fan yourself a time or two, and tear up when you least suspect it. I recommend this to fans of sports romance and forbidden romance. Hell, if you enjoy romantic books period, read it! This is a good one people! Don't say I never told you! Now, go add it to your tbr! Buy it! Read it! You won't be sorry!

From the internationally best-selling, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, a superbly crafted new work of fiction: eight stories--longer and more emotionally complex than any she has yet written--that take us from Cambridge and Seattle to India and Thailand as they enter the lives of sisters and brothers, fathers and mothers, daughters and sons, friends and lovers.
In the stunning title story, Ruma, a young mother in a new city, is visited by her father, who carefully tends the earth of her garden, where he and his grandson form a special bond. But he's harboring a secret from his daughter, a love affair he's keeping all to himself. In ""A Choice of Accommodations,"" a husband's attempt to turn an old friend's wedding into a romantic getaway weekend with his wife takes a dark, revealing turn as the party lasts deep into the night. In ""Only Goodness,"" a sister eager to give her younger brother the perfect childhood she never had is overwhelmed by guilt, anguish, and anger when his alcoholism threatens her family. And in ""Hema and Kaushik,"" a trio of linked stories--a luminous, intensely compelling elegy of life, death, love, and fate--we follow the lives of a girl and boy who, one winter, share a house in Massachusetts. They travel from innocence to experience on separate, sometimes painful paths, until destiny brings them together again years later in Rome.

 This story was disturbing, disgusting, creepy, and vile.... 
 ...and I kinda liked it. 
 There are few people I feel could get away with writing a story about the horrors of motherhood and it becomes an actual horror story. Yes, this story isn't original--very reminiscent of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn, and those other cannibal/torture-related stories. However, what sets this gruesome depiction apart from the others is the idea of motherhood--how far will you go to save your child? How far will you go to love your child? What does it take to keep a family together? These questions are asked through three different perspectives--Ann's, Vera's, and Vera's mother (Of course Ann is the best mom here, obviously). 
 I was very impressed with the music that was played throughout the audiobook--I think that was a great addition to the story and really gave you something to ruminate on. 
 Some negative things I will say is that the narrator did a good job, but it wasn't the best narration I've experienced. He attempted to use different voices for each character, but there were times where all the voices sounded the same and I couldn't pick out who was talking (especially between Frank and Mimi). Another negative is that the inflection the narrator used during times of stress for the characters lacked. For instance, when Ann first met Vera and her husband was missing. The writing appeared to have Ann worried, but the narrator sounded joyful (when Ann was answering Vera's questions about Baby James). If I narrated, my voice would have been hesitant and showed more appropriate emotion. Finally, the last negative thing about the book, itself, is that many parts of Vera's characterization was repeated MANY MANY MANY unnecessary times. How many times do we need to hear that she gets turned on by one specific thing (that I won't spoil for you). I just felt the flow of the story could have been improved with a fiercer editing process.",0.0,0,47304,543522.96,11.49,711,5,5,4

Most of his book plots sound intriguing and draw you in. 
 The first downside, as I discovered with this, my only Coben book so far, is the absolutely terrible writing: he presents, at best, two-dimensional characters; he uses some quite awkward dialogue; and he crow-bars in some of the most unnecessary and extraordinary similes. 
 The second downside is the plot development. It twists and turns so much that it becomes illogical and insensible - it is not a satisfying read. The description on the back of the book described it as having ""the most jaw-dropping plot twist ever"" - a week later I am still waiting for my jaw to drop. I am not even sure which of the various twists this refers to as none really qualify. By the last page I literally didn't care about what was revealed because somehow it managed to be simultaneously both predictable and unbelievable. 
 I have given this book two stars because, despite all my criticisms, I did at least keep turning the pages. I did, to some extent, want to see what happened next, although, by the last chapter my interest had waned.

The bulk of the novel is a gripping man-on-the-run sequence relayed in terse, masterful prose as Moss, who's taken the money, tries to evade Wells, an ex-Special Forces agent employed by a powerful cartel, and Chigurh, an icy psychopathic murderer armed with a cattle gun and a dangerous philosophy of justice. Also concerned about Moss's whereabouts is Sheriff Bell, an aging lawman struggling with his sense that there's a new breed of man (embodied in Chigurh) whose destructive power he simply cannot match.

This is the second Cormac McCarthy novel that I have read, having previously read The Road in 2012 and I think it is sage to say that it is going to be my last. 
 I really find his writing style hard to get on with an below have listed the reasons why. 
 1) There is a lack of punctuation throughout the whole novel. Apostrophes and speech marks are the two most commonly missed out, in fact I do not believe that speech marks are used at all. This really annoys me as it meant that I often read whole sections of text only realising in the middle that what I was reading was a conversation. 
 2) It is written in a very heavy southern states dialect that I simply don't understand, being British and having never visited Texas or the surrounding states I was often completely unable to follow conversations due to the phraseology being used. I like authors giving a character an accent and using occasional local expressions but when they are appearing on every page it just becomes difficult to understand the novel as a whole. 
 3) Often characters were not properly reintroduced when entering a conversation and therefore I could often read a page or so of conversation before I actually managed to work out who was doing the talking. If the story just followed a clear path of one character then this would be ok, but the book doesn't do this. It is frequently moving between different characters in different locations which made it important to know who was involved in each change of scene. 
 Then there is the actual story, if I had fully been able to keep track of what was going on then it would have been a really good plot. It's certainly not your typical crime novel which focuses heavily on the police and always ends in a arrest. This novel focusses much more on the 'bad guys' and even though sections are written from the polices view they are generally more philosophical sections that actually about the solving of the crime. I would have liked to have been able to say that I thought it was a great story but I so often couldn't follow it that it lost all its shape. 
 However it has been made into a supposedly very good film so maybe when I watch that I'll have a better idea of what actually happened in the book.",0.0,0,323,1611.77,4.99,306,1,2,2

Matters do not go as planned and, though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.
In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor - engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven - but the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. Even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.
As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroadis at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.",Fiction,Excellent,37,1,16,7.432432432432432,11,4.03,86839,4.0,"For the first time since before college and grad school, I actually have time to read the hyped, ""book of the year"" books.

There were people including my husband, who invested decades in this series and like my husband, felt betrayed by King for doing Roland that way...but not me.

These stories seem deceptively simple in its language and tone, yet, of the two I read ""Visting"" and ""Our Portion, Our Rock"" (a title, I still don't get), the plodding of the plot belies roiling anger, resentment, and regrets - both stories seem to be about ""the one that got away"" - perhaps a lover that just never felt right, or a father that just never saw things right, or a son that grew up faster than the father who only sees him on weekends. There are missed opportunities here for reconciliation, as both stories end quite bleakly.

If Gordon, the rookie who really is in his teens, can't cut ties with his old life and accept his new limitations, Cole will have to discreetly dispose of the kid--the same way a mad dog would be put down for the safety of society.

Suffering multiple injuries, he struggles to retain consciousness until a blurry image materializes and comes into focus beside him: his beloved wife Ruth, who passed away nine years ago. Urging him to hang on, she forces him to remain alert by recounting the stories of their lifetime together - how they met, the precious paintings they collected together, the dark days of WWII and its effect on them and their families. Ira knows that Ruth can't possibly be in the car with him, but he clings to her words and his memories, reliving the sorrows and everyday joys that defined their marriage.
A few miles away, at a local rodeo, a Wake Forest College senior's life is about to change. Recovering from a recent break-up, Sophia Danko meets a young cowboy named Luke, who bears little resemblance to the privileged frat boys she has encountered at school. Through Luke, Sophia is introduced to a world in which the stakes of survival and success, ruin and reward - even life and death - loom large in everyday life. As she and Luke fall in love, Sophia finds herself imagining a future far removed from her plans - a future that Luke has the power to rewrite... if the secret he's keeping doesn't destroy it first.
Ira and Ruth. Sophia and Luke. Two couples who have little in common, and who are separated by years and experience. Yet their lives will converge with unexpected poignancy, reminding us all that even the most difficult decisions can yield extraordinary journeys: beyond despair, beyond death, to the farthest reaches of the human heart.",Fiction,Excellent,16,1,13,6.75,7,4.13,157,5.0,"For a more in depth review, please visit my blog, Chorley Chronicals! 
 Nicholas Sparks has always been one of my favorite author's. He was actually one of if not THE first author that I ever discovered. At one time, I couldn't get enough of his writing, and soaked up every single one of his books. Then I started dabbling with other author's and honestly haven't came back to him until now. Oh my, although I hadn't realized it until the first few minutes into the book, how did I miss him and his writing! 
 Sparks has an extraordinary talent for delivering heart-felt, heart string tugging stories that leave you feeling like weeping and laughing, all at the same time. I have always felt an amazing spark and connection when reading his books, and The Longest Ride was no different. I always get so lost in his writing, and I found myself soaring through all of the different emotions while listening to The Longest Ride. I felt a great connection to the story! 
 In the past, I have only listened to mystery/suspense novels on audio, so I was quite leery about listening to a non-mystery book on audio, so much so, that I actually put off listening to this book for several months. With this book, I learned that most genres should be okay on audio, that it's not reserved for just mystery books (and be good, at least!) I thought that the narrators, Ron McLarty and January LaVoy, fit their perspective characters perfectly. I really felt like I was listening to Ira when McLarty read! My only quirk would be that LaVoy also read the part of Dylan, so it was a little irking to hear a female try to sound like a manly cowboy! Other than that, I think that the narration of The Longest Ride was great, and if I had to rate it, would rate it at least 4-1/2 stars! 
 I feel like you can never go wrong with Nicholas Sparks, and this book left me feeling no different. It really made me feel like I've been missing a lot in the few years that it's been since I've read a Sparks book. He has a way with words and really delivers some of the best love stories ever written! His stories are impeccable and mesmerizing! And I thoroughly enjoyed reading about both sets of couples, Ira and Ruth, and their life-long love story, which was truly touching, and Sophie and Dylan, who were just beginning their adventure of their love life, where they seem destined to be together! I thought that Sparks expertly intersected the lives of these four people, and brought it altogether at the end. 
 Overall, of all the Nicholas Sparks books that I've read, that this one definitely stands out as one of the most touching stories that he's written. Most retailers compare it to The Notebook, however, I feel like The Longest Ride may even surpass the greatness of The Notebook, which I would have thought was impossible to do! I can't wait to catch up with the Sparks novels that I've missed and see what else he can pull out of his sleeve, because he truly is a remarkable author with astonishing writing abilities!",0.0,0,3942,3902.58,0.99,631,3,4,5

Ira Levinson is in trouble. Ninety-one years old and stranded and injured after a car crash, he struggles to retain consciousness until a blurry image materializes beside him: his beloved wife Ruth, who passed away nine years ago. Urging him to hang on, she forces him to remain alert by recounting the stories of their lifetime together.
A few miles away, at a local bull-riding event, a Wake Forest College senior's life is about to change. Recovering from a recent break-up, Sophia Danko meets a young cowboy named Luke, who bears little resemblance to the privileged frat boys she has encountered at school. Through Luke, Sophia is introduced to a world in which the stakes of survival and success, ruin and reward -- even life and death - loom large in everyday life. As she and Luke fall in love, Sophia finds herself imagining a future far removed from her plans -- a future that Luke has the power to rewrite . . . if the secret he's keeping doesn't destroy it first.
Ira and Ruth. Sophia and Luke. Two couples who have little in common, and who are separated by years and experience.

This is a competent comedy written by a man who is normally a comic genius. 
 All Hiassen's usual characters are here, ""Skink"" the one-eyed ex-governor turned crazy eco-warrior. ""Chemo"" the scary killer with the peeled face and the bitten off hand from ""Skinny Dip"". There is the usual chaotic larger-than-life plot revolving around greedy, grasping people who are so amoral they have little or no understanding of what they have become and there are the few characters whose humanity, independence and refusal to give up makes them shine in the human-swamp that surrounds them. 
 But the story lacks passion. Hiassen seems to be going through the motions. Skink, for once, seems lost and not entirely sure of why he's there. Dear God, he even ends up in a pin-striped suit. Chemo loses his menace and even seems to develop a conscience. 
 The evil that the bad people do is largely to themselves and is hard to get excited about. 
 The book is redeemed by the two main female characters, Cherry Pie, the young self-abusing pop-star and her body-double, spunky actress, Anne. 
 These are the women that Hiassen seems to fall in love with in the book and that love drives everything else. He does a wonderful job of showing Cherry as more than an air-head. My heart went out to her because she wants to called ""Cherish"" because it sounds cool but I couldn't help seeing the pathos of this name for someone who has never been cherished. 
 Anne is brave and funny and honest and gets all the best lines. What's not to love. Except perhaps that she treats the governor as an accessory, a plot device in the drama of her life, rather thana person. Perhaps this is what makes her the perfect actress. 
 The book is of course well written, it made me laugh. It just wasn't as good a ""Skinny Dip"" or ""Nature Girl"". 
 Perhaps I'm missing the point. Perhaps what Hiassen wanted to show was that the paperazzi-ridden pop world is so fake it kills all real passion but I don't think so.",0.0,0,237,708.63,2.99,376,1,3,3

69,The Chosen,Chaim Potok,1967,2012,"In this heart pounding sequel to The Planner, Homeland Security is using the National Defense Authorization Act to incarcerate tens of thousands of Americans in secret government prisons where they are never heard from again.
When Father Nathan O'Brien is arrested for refusing to preach the messages mandated by the Religious Unity Agency, Michael Linton and Jeff Conners call attention to abuses of government power by setting up ""The Wall"", a website which publishes the names of all those who have vanished. Soon, the entire country is talking about the problems of indefinite detention, but before long, the Electronic Communications' Agency dubs ""The Wall"" the greatest act of terrorism in U.S. history and arrests Michael and Jeff as domestic terrorists.
With Michael and Jeff gone, Michael's wife Kris and her brother Keith know that the time has come for them to stand up for the Constitution and fight for the laws of our country.",Fiction,Excellent,39,1,10,4.425,5,3.7,57,4.0,"""The Chosen"" by Alexandra and Joyce Swann is a fascinating glimpse at what happens when autocratic leadership violates human rights and freedoms. As the story opens Kris Mitchell Linton's husband Michael and his friend Jeff Connors have been arrested by Federal Agents for assisting in the creation of a website called ""The Wall"" which lists hundreds of Americans who have been detained without any evidence or a trial. With the help of a smart, God-fearing Constitutional lawyer Kris files a suit against the government for violation of articles in the Constitution dealing with unlawful arrest and imprisonment without the right to a trial. Like the Maccabees revolt in 168BC against the cruel and dictatorial leadership of Antiochus Epiphanies who forbade the worship of the God of Israel and desecrated the Temple, Kris, her brother Keith and their friends Jessie and Kyle stand up against the tyrannical policy of an arrogant despot, President Tom Quincy. 
 This is a riveting story about a nation on the brink of disaster not only because of a government's abuse of power and injustice, but also because of peoples' complacency when they drift away from the principles and faith their county was founded on. Yet within the darkness of corruption and turmoil there shines a light engendered by the faith, courage and the self-sacrifice of a few willing to stand against an evil that would destroy their rights and freedoms. 
 This is a well-written and spellbinding story that flows naturally as the abuse of the government grows and tension mounts in a legal battle that will make history and determine the fate of thousands. The personalities of the characters are multi-faceted and draw the reader deeper into their emotional turmoil. Kris Mitchell Linton fears for the life of her child and husband, but looks to her faith for strength and courage. She's determined and resilient, willing to sacrifice her life if it means helping thousands incarcerated unjustly. Keith Mitchell, crippled spiritually by the loss of his wife and child struggles with his doubts and fears, but is determined to protect his family and friends. Julian Cicchetti is the brilliant Constitutional lawyer whose faith is tested, and whose career and life are jeopardized when he tackles a case that seems unwinnable. 
 Even the secondary characters are as important and unforgettable to the story as those in the forefront of the fight against the government. Among them are Father Nathan O'Brien, a man of strong faith willing to pay the price for not conforming to the government's liturgical standards; Michael Linton and Jeff Connors determined and brave in their stand against oppression. Even the antagonists heighten this emotionally-charged story with their arrogance, pride and hunger for power; Vice President Peters, a woman whose moral compass has been undermined by a philandering husband and President Tom Quincy, a type of anti-Christ with his lust for power and authority.

70,Intensity,Dean Koontz,1996,2007,"Chyna Shepherd is a twenty-six-year-old woman whose deeply troubled childhood taught her the hard rules of survival, and whose adult life has been an unrelenting struggle for self-respect and safety. Now rare trust has blossomed for Chyna into friendship with the woman whose family home she is visiting for the weekend: a farm in the Napa Valley surrounded by vineyards and hills, which Chyna can see from the guest-room window where she sits at one o'clock in the morning, fully dressed, unable to sleep. Suspicions she learned in childhood still make her uneasy in unfamiliar houses--even this one, where her closest friend is sound asleep down the hall. And in this case her most disturbing instincts prove reliable. A man has entered the house, a man who lives for one purpose: to satisfy all appetites as they arise, to immerse himself in sensation, to live without fear, remorse, or limits--to live with intensity.
His name is Edgler Foreman Vess. He likes to make words with the letters from his name--GOD, DEMON, SAVE, RAGE, ANGER, FEAR, FOREVER, are just a few of them--and then makes sentences with the words. One of his favorites, GOD FEARS ME, is sometimes the last thing he whispers to his victims. Edgler Vess is a self-proclaimed ""homicidal adventurer"": On this night, his adventure--murdering everyone in the house--becomes Chyna's long nightmare.
Trapped in Vess's deadly orbit, Chyna thinks only of getting out alive. But when she inadvertently learns the identity of Vess's intended next victim, waiting for him far from Napa Valley, Chyna is gripped with concern for this other person, who is as innocent as Chyna, and as endangered. Driven now by a sense of responsibility for another, by a purpose and meaning beyond mere self-preservation, Chyna rises to unexpected heights of courage and daring--her only hope as the threat of Edgler Foreman Vess closes in and grows more horrifying moment by moment.
Intensity unfolds over the course of just twenty-four hours, but within that brief time frame, Dean Koontz gives us what is perhaps his most inventive, emotionally intricate, and terrifyingly suspenseful novel yet.",Fiction,Excellent,12,1,14,5.833333333333333,2,4.04,1133,2.0,"Intensity by Dean Koontz has a great premise. A woman is hiding under a bed, she sees blood drip in front of black boots. A man she doesn't know is walking around her room, searching for more victims. The family she's visiting has already been murdered. Sounds like this could be an exciting and thrilling and horrifying book right? Well it would have been if it wasn't marred by terrible prose and the dullest female protagonist of all time. Dean Koontz has a mastery of vocabulary both extensive and obscure, but the fanciest of words do not a suspenseful novel make. 
 Let's start at the beginning, shall we? 
 ""The red sun balances on the highest ramparts of the mountains, and in its waning light, the foothills appear to be ablaze. A cool breeze blows down out of the sun and fans through the tall dry grass, which streams like waves of golden fire along the slopes toward the rich and shadowed valley."" 
 Umm, okay. Interesting (in a not interesting) way to start your horror novel. I read this sample when I wanted to test out the book to see if I would like it before buying it. I thought that the prose felt a little too purpley but it wasn't deal breaker to stop me from purchasing it. I wanted a horror novel for the month of October and this seemed like a good candidate as any. 
 By the time I got to the dialogue, it was too late to turn back. 
 ""You've got a heavy foot,"" Chyna said. 
 Laura grinned. ""Better than a big butt."" 
 ""You'll get us killed."" 
 ""Mom has rules about being late for dinner."" 
 ""Being late is better than being dead for dinner."" 
 ""You've never met my mom. She's hell on rules."" 
 ""So is the highway patrol."" 
 Laura laughed. ""Sometimes you sound just like her."" 
 ""Who?"" 
 ""My mom."" 
 The dialogue seems harmless enough right? A tad on the corny side but nothing atrocious, right? I convinced myself to keep going. 
 ""Man, I love speed,"" Laura said. 
 ""I hate it."" 
 ""I like to move, streak, fly. Hey, maybe I was a gazelle in a previous life. You think?"" 
 Chyna looked at the speedometer and grimaced. ""Yeah, maybe a gazelle-or a madwoman locked away in Bedlam."" 
 WHO TALKS LIKE THAT? Granted, this book was published in 1987 but still, no one talked like that in the 80's. So already the believability of these characters has flown out the window of this speeding car. These are not old women, they're young adults. I was starting to feel buyer's remorse but maybe, just maybe when the killer shows up things will get better. 
 And it did, for a time. Though it was interesting (not exciting) to watch Chyna evade the killer, it became tedious and boring by excessive and I mean EXCESSIVE description on every thought and action Chyna made. ""I shouldn't go into the bathroom because the killer might notice me. I shouldn't move from under the bed because he might sense my presence. I can't attack him head on because he's stronger than me. I can-"" BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH!!!!!! F***! SO FRUSTRATING! 
 A horror novel set in contemporary United States shouldn't be meandering on useless details and character thoughts. If maybe the girl was transported to a horror nightmare world where walls were made of human skin, then yes by all means, add in those descriptions. In this context, it just makes Chyna an uninteresting and bland character. The author bludgeons you over the head with the same, repetitive message. ""Do you get it? Chyna is weak! See her thoughts? See how she can't act? Chyna's weak! Hang on, let me tell you about her abused childhood and show you how weak she was then. DO YOU GET IT? CHYNA IS WEAK!"" 
 I GOT IT! 
 How did this become a New York Times Best Seller? How? Where was the fear? Where was the suspense? I didn't care about what would happen to Chyna because she was so dull. The book would have been more interesting if it was from the perspective of Laura, Chyna's friend who dies at the beginning of the book. Spoilers? Who cares, don't read this boring novel. 
 Ironically, the antagonist Edgler Vess was an interesting character. Maybe not ironic but rather a pity that our villain proved to be more interesting than our heroine. I know that great villains are what makes the most interesting stories but at the same time we need a protagonist to root for. I never wanted Edgler to win but I also didn't feel that Chyna deserved to win either. 
 Also, why is this book so freaking long? 450 pages I believe? None of the content in this book justifies it's bloated page count. I can summarize it for you in one sentence. Killer murders family, girl chases after killer, killer chases girl, drama, end book. Oh I know why it was bloated. THERE WAS TOO MUCH DESCRIPTION! 
 A horror novel doesn't have to move at a breakneck pace but it also shouldn't languish on needless description. There should have been less focus on Chyna's thoughts and the environment and more focus on actions. Where Koontz's descriptions were actually appropriate and well done was in describing the murder scenes, dead bodies, and a scene towards the end involving dogs. These scenes were extremely visual and engaging to the point that I wish the entire novel had been written this way. 
 Overall, if you're looking for a book that will frighten you and make you want to leave the lights on at night, Intensity is not the one for you. It wasn't the worst book I've read, it wasn't even a runner up, but it's definitely in my top list of worst books ever.

71,No Country For Old Men,Cormac McCarthy,2005,2006,"In 1980 southwest Texas, Llewelyn Moss, hunting antelope near the Rio Grande, stumbles across several dead men, a bunch of heroin and $2.4 million in cash. The bulk of the novel is a gripping man-on-the-run sequence relayed in terse, masterful prose as Moss, who's taken the money, tries to evade Wells, an ex-Special Forces agent employed by a powerful cartel, and Chigurh, an icy psychopathic murderer armed with a cattle gun and a dangerous philosophy of justice. Also concerned about Moss's whereabouts is Sheriff Bell, an aging lawman struggling with his sense that there's a new breed of man (embodied in Chigurh) whose destructive power he simply cannot match. In a series of thoughtful first-person passages interspersed throughout, Sheriff Bell laments the changing world, wrestles with an uncomfortable memory from his service in WWII and--a soft ray of light in a book so steeped in bloodshed--rejoices in the great good fortune of his marriage. While the action of the novel thrills, it's the sensitivity and wisdom of Sheriff Bell that makes the book a profound meditation on the battle between good and evil and the roles choice and chance play in the shaping of a life.",Fiction,Excellent,5,8,9,8.6,11,4.13,341,4.0,"Let's get this straight: McCarthy is far from being my cup of tea.

Atwood builds on the world created in the previous book, but totally shifts perspective from a world laced with tech and science to one of religion, ritual and nature. 
 Atwood creates a very engaging story of the lives of two women, Ren and Toby and how their experiences with ""God's Gardeners"" impact their futures. The gardeners' religion is wonderfully crafted, with a well-established doctrine that provides the women with skills and experiences that become more and more useful as the plot advances. I loved all the ways in which Atwood integrates the lost knowledge of our environment, from the free food we could forage to the dangerous poisons growing should we need them. In an age where food is so taken for granted it is always interesting to ponder what would happen if our supplies dried up, and how little we know of the world around us. 
 The story is woven wonderfully around the plot of Oryx and Crake, and although the plot does not advance and further in time-scale it is still immensely engaging to view the whole story from a completely different viewpoint.

79,The Underground Railroad,Colson Whitehead,2016,2016,"Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. Life is hellish for all the slaves but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood - where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned and, though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.
In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor - engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven - but the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. Even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.
As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroadis at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.",Fiction,Excellent,37,1,16,7.432432432432432,11,4.03,86839,4.0,"By my count, three black science fiction writers have been recognized with MacArthur ""genius grants."" Everyone agrees on the first: Octavia Butler, taken too soon. Everyone knows the second: Ta-Nehisi Coates, who's in on what I'm sure some will argue is a technicality for writing a dozen issues of BLACK PANTHER. (And let me just observe here that it's more than a technicality -- yes, the vibranium and the resurrection tanks and whatnot barely get you in the door, but what makes Coates and BLACK PANTHER the real deal is his wrestling with the idea of Wakanda. On the one hand, he's perhaps more seduced than anyone by the idea of an African city that's more than self-sufficient, that's in fact economically and technologically dominant on the world stage; on the other, he knows better than anyone the sort of violence nation-states are built on, and the sorrow with which he goes about scarring and complicating the Wakandan Dream just about screams from every panel -- 
 -- OK, stopping now while I can still save this. Not even closing the parenthesis. The third is Colson Whitehead, on the strength at least but perhaps not exclusively of THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. 
 The most famous bit of speculation is, of course the railroad itself, the network of protectors and spiriters-away literalized into physical tunnels, rails, and trains. Their origin is mysterious, but their operations are as concrete as you could want: Timetables are notional at best, stations and their agents are periodically discovered and destroyed, stops are canceled and routed around -- and, most importantly, they are not announced. When the train comes, you take it wherever it's going. 
 These caprices of operation are what bring our heroine, Cora, through a series of Whitehead's subtler speculations: Each state of the South is its own miniature, highlighting some vexation of black existence in the antebellum South (and, ultimately, North as well). There is the South Carolina in which gentleness toward slaves masks a covert medical operation that makes Tuskegee look like a Twitter poll; the North Carolina in which white rage has overcome white greed, and the penalty for being black in the state's borders is death; the Tennessee ravaged by fire and plague, consumed by the fear of its majority population finding the will to rise up; the Indiana in which former slaves might, perhaps, find a place to rest and belong in freedom. It presumably goes without saying that the century and change between Appomattox and Trump have sapped precious little relevance from these vignettes. 
 Vignettes they are, though, and it's fair enough to say that there's not necessarily a strong emotional core or narrative arc to the book; Cora is more or less windswept, her trajectory from scene to scene a function of the world's actions, not her own. But there's value, to say nothing of beauty, in a well-crafted series of vignettes; and it feels piggy to ask more from Cora, who has been so hard put simply to endure what's come to her, and whom we appreciate, in the last analysis, for her ability to look power in the eye and decline to shuck and jive. 
 It's fair, too, to observe that the Underground Railroad is depersonalized, a network of relationships and people crystallized into metal and stone. Thinking about it this way, though, the shibboleth about the railroad's creation takes on a few new layers of meaning. When Cora (or anyone) asks who built the Underground Railroad, the response is ""Who builds anything in this country?"" It's a glib rejoinder, almost a put-down, at first blush. But it has the curious effect of bringing all of black America in on the conspiracy to secure its own freedom; and, from the evanescent ties of care and fellow-traveling that formed the original Railroad, to create a monument to freedom that would long outlast its use, that would wink quietly from the trapdoors of cellars and cisterns and remind us what had been done, and why, and at what cost.",1.0,0,108,538.9200000000001,4.99,1195,1,4,4

The volcanic processes by which the Hawaiian Islands grew from the ocean floor were inconceivably slow, and the land remained untouched by man for countless centuries until, little more than a thousand years ago, Polynesian seafarers made the perilous journey across the Pacific and discovered their new home. They lived and flourished in this tropical paradise according to their ancient traditions and beliefs until, in the early nineteenth century, American missionaries arrived, bringing a new creed and a new way of life to a Stone Age society. The impact of the missionaries had only begun to be absorbed when other national groups, with equally different customs, began to migrate in great numbers to the islands.

Running for his life, but not before he picks up a bloodstained letter opener that puts the president at the scene of the crime, the burglar becomes the target of a clandestine manhunt orchestrated by leading members of the executive branch.

The year is 1896. The city is New York.

From there the two embark on a revolutionary effort in criminology: creating a psychological profile of the perpetrator based on the details of his crimes. Their dangerous quest takes them into the tortured past and twisted mind of a murderer who will kill again before their hunt is over.
Fast-paced and riveting, infused with historical detail, The Alienistconjures up Gilded Age New York, with its tenements and mansions, corrupt cops and flamboyant gangsters, shining opera houses and seamy gin mills.

Life is hellish for all the slaves but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood - where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned and, though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.
In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor - engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven - but the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. Even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.
As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroadis at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.",Fiction,Excellent,37,1,16,7.432432432432432,11,4.03,86839,3.0,"I could not get into this book, and that makes me feel like there is something wrong with me.

Sweet Thursday is the sequel to Cannery Row.",Fiction,Excellent,8,3,5,3.75,5,4.02,83404,5.0,"Cannery Row is more than just a book. It is... a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream.(John Steinbeck; Cannery Row, page 1) 
 In short, it is nothing less than a masterpiece. It is also an unlikely summer destination which memory stayed so vividly with me that I had just to read it again. 
 John Steinbeck did not study Literature. He studied Marine Biology. He wrote like the way a Nobel Prize awardee should write and he created Cannery Row like the sea floor: dark, light, colorful, beautiful, savage, and diverse. 
 In a prose both sentimental and uncaring, he brought to life do-no-gooders with good intentions, virtuous bordello staffs, lovely sea anemones, hermit crabs, gophers, a Chinese grocer balanced between Lao Tze and the cash register, a genius boat-builder afraid of the ocean, gila monsters, rattlesnakes, honeybees, soldiers, watchmen, at least two dozens tomcats, at least six hundred frogs. 
 And from this book came my favorite advise when it comes to writing: 
 "" How can a poem and the stink and the grating noise- the quality of light, the tone, the habit, the dream- be set down alive? When collecting marine animals, there are certain flat worms so delicate that they are almost impossible to capture whole, for they break and tatter under touch. You must let them ooze and crawl of their own will onto a knife blade and then lift them gently into your bottle of sea water. And perhaps that might be the way to write this book- to open the page and to let the stories crawl in by themselves.""-John Steinbeck; Cannery Row 
 But Cannery Row did more than just ooze and crawl into the pages. The story jumped, exploded, camped, hunted, danced, and partied, and held music recitals, launched artworks, and hosted sublime poetry readings. 
 More than anything else, Cannery Row is a peephole through which we may perceive things and places and people differently. Through this peephole, instead of a stinking, poverty-stricken place we may see a home; catch glimpses of Virtues, Graces, and Beauties in thieves, rascals, and bums, hear the piercingly sweet music amidst the grating noise.

Hannah Sunderland felt content in her embrace of the Quaker faith..until her twin brother ran off and joined the army and ended up captured and in jail. Suddenly Hannah's world turns on end. She longs to bring her brother some measure of comfort in the squalid, frigid prison where he remains. But the Quakers believe they are not to take sides, not to take up arms.

Jeremiah Jones has an enormous task before him. Responsibility for a spy ring is now his, and he desperately needs access to the men in prison, whom they are seeking to free. A possible solution is to garner a pass for Hannah.

This is the second Cormac McCarthy novel that I have read, having previously read The Road in 2012 and I think it is sage to say that it is going to be my last. 
 I really find his writing style hard to get on with an below have listed the reasons why. 
 1) There is a lack of punctuation throughout the whole novel. Apostrophes and speech marks are the two most commonly missed out, in fact I do not believe that speech marks are used at all. This really annoys me as it meant that I often read whole sections of text only realising in the middle that what I was reading was a conversation. 
 2) It is written in a very heavy southern states dialect that I simply don't understand, being British and having never visited Texas or the surrounding states I was often completely unable to follow conversations due to the phraseology being used. I like authors giving a character an accent and using occasional local expressions but when they are appearing on every page it just becomes difficult to understand the novel as a whole. 
 3) Often characters were not properly reintroduced when entering a conversation and therefore I could often read a page or so of conversation before I actually managed to work out who was doing the talking. If the story just followed a clear path of one character then this would be ok, but the book doesn't do this. It is frequently moving between different characters in different locations which made it important to know who was involved in each change of scene. 
 Then there is the actual story, if I had fully been able to keep track of what was going on then it would have been a really good plot. It's certainly not your typical crime novel which focuses heavily on the police and always ends in a arrest. This novel focusses much more on the 'bad guys' and even though sections are written from the polices view they are generally more philosophical sections that actually about the solving of the crime. I would have liked to have been able to say that I thought it was a great story but I so often couldn't follow it that it lost all its shape. 
 However it has been made into a supposedly very good film so maybe when I watch that I'll have a better idea of what actually happened in the book.",0.0,0,323,1611.77,4.99,306,1,2,2

The actors who portrayed the characters that Dennis Lehane crafted were right there with me as I turned the pages. 
 This is a tale of three children whose lives were intertwined in their youth and then of their living with the ghosts of the past. Three very different children: Jimmy, the rebel, the tough and fearless boy; Sean, the boy who knew he was meant for something better in life because his parents told him so; and Dave, the oddball kid that trailed along with Jimmy and Sean, always trying to fit in. Little did these three boys know that that day they played on the street - a day like any other - that particular day would change and affect their lives forever. The day when 11 year old Dave is driven away in a car by two men posing as police officers, while Jimmy and Sean watched in horror. 
 The days that followed...when Dave escaped his captors and returned home. Home to a mother who chose not to deal with what happened to her son, and in her not dealing, poor Dave had to bury his horrific ordeal. On top of his mother's lack of empathy for him, the kids at school began to isolate him as well, calling him names, as though what had happened to him had been his fault. Even Jimmy and Sean weren't there for him. 
 Time moves forward to adulthood. Sean is a police officer; married and separated, now married to his job, but still yearning for the woman he loves. Jimmy became the leader of a gang by the time he was 17, married, had a child, went to jail, lost his wife to cancer, and when he got out jail, Jimmy became a law abiding citizen for the sake of his daughter, Katie. Jimmy remarries the sister of some of his former gang members, and they have two daughters. He runs a local corner store. Dave manages to find some solace in high school when it is realized he is a great pitcher. Dave settles down and marries, and has a son. He is a devoted father, and a good husband, but he always seems to be tortured by something. He never seems able to hold on to a job for long, so he and his family just get by. Jimmy's and Dave's lives are intertwined by the mere fact that their wives are cousins. 
 However, the demons begin to rise to the surface, and in doing so, they bring these three childhood friends together again - but it was not a happy reunion. Jimmy's daughter, Katie, is murdered. Sean is called in to help solve the crime. Jimmy promises his dead daughter that he will see justice done for her. At the same time, Dave's demon begins to consume him, and he begins to act out of his normal demure character. As Sean and his partner work the case, Dave's inconsistent story of what he did the night of the murder begins to cast a dark shadow over him as the possible murderer.

Referendum baru saja dilakukan di Aljazair, negara jajahan Prancis, dan referendum itu memutuskan bahwa Aljazair melepaskan diri dari Prancis sebagai negara yang merdeka. Peristiwa inilah yang melatarbelakangi usaha pembunuhan terhadap Presiden Prancis, Charles de Gaulle oleh gerakan sayap kanan Prancis. Apa itu pembunuhan?Assassinology.org memberi definisi dan tujuan pembunuhan sebagai berikut. 
 Assassination 
 : The act of assassination occurs when someone important is murdered for one of three reasons: 
 1. Political beliefs: the selective killing of an individual enemy in the hope that their policies die with them. 
 2. Power: committed simply to take the place of a VIP, or to transfer their power to someone else. As international terrorist Carlos the Jackal put it: ""To get anywhere, you have to walk over corpses"". 
 3. Notoriety: Disturbed individuals who want to achieve fame through the elimination of a VIP. Sirhan Sirhan told his interrogators: ""They can gas me, but I am famous; I have achieved in one day what it took Robert Kennedy all his life to do"". 
 Dari definisi di atas, tujuan pembunuhan Charles de Gaulle yaitu untuk menumbangkan kekuasaan termasuk dengan seluruh kebijakan politik yang telah dibuat sebelumnya. Sebelum cerita berlanjut, kita amati sejenak konteks yang terjadi pada saat peristiwa dalam novel ini terjadi. 
 Perang Aljazair 
 Sejak Tahun 1830 hingga 1962, Aljazair masuk dalam wilayah Prancis. Aljazair bagian dari Prancis, bukan negara kolonial Prancis. Negara yang masuk kolonial Prancis adalah Mexico di Amerika Selatan serta Indocina (Vietnam) di Asia Tenggara. Aljazair memiliki kaitan erat terhadap perang dunia kedua. Sebagian besar pasukan sekutu dari Prancis berasal dari Aljazair. Pada 1947, dibentuk Algerian Assembly. Algerian Assembly adalah parlemennya Aljazair yang nantinya akan memilih Perdana Menteri. Algerian Assembly terdiri dari dua warganegara mayoritas, yaitu muslim dari Aljazair sendiri dan nonmuslim dari Eropa (Prancis). Pada tahun 1948, terjadi protes dari warga negara muslim Aljazair. Mereka keberatan dengan komposisi suara dalam Algerian Assembly itu dimana warga muslim sebanyak 8.000.000 jiwa mewakili 50% suara, sementara 50% suara lagi diwakili oleh 1.500.000 jiwa dari warga nonmuslim. 
 Pada tahun 1954-1962, pecah perang antara Prancis dan Aljazair. Perang tersebut dimotori Front de Liberation National (FLN). FLN berperang melawan gerakan pro Prancis, serta pemerintahan de Gaulle. Pada saat itu pasukan Prancis dibuat repot dengan menghadapi dua kelompok, yaitu FLN dan Organisation de l'armee secrete (OAS). OAS tetap menginginkan agar Aljazair tetap masuk wilayah Prancis. Intinya, OAS antikemerdekaan Aljazair. Motto OAS adalah Algeria is French and will remain so"" (L'Algerie est francaise et le restera). OAS juga menghadapi dua musuh sekaligus. Satu sisi ia berhadapan dengan FLN, satu sisi OAS memberontak terhadap pemerintahan de Gaulle. 
 Charles de Gaulle sebagai Prsiden saat itu menawarkan jalan referendum untuk menyelesaikan perang yang berlarut-larut serta memperbaiki ekonomi Aljazair. Sementara sudah dilakukan gencatan senjata antara pasukan Prancis dan Front Pembebasan Nasional Aljazair, OAS melakukan provokasi dengan menyerang dan membom di kota Paris. Referendum dilakukan pada 8 Januari 1961 Dan Prancis mengakui kemerdekaan Aljazair pada 3 Juli 1962. Kemerdekaan Aljazair inilah yang membuat OAS semakin membenci pemerintahan Prancis di bawah Jenderal Charles de Gaulle. 
 Operasi Pembunuhan 
 Usaha pembunuhan terhadap Jenderal de Gaulle dilakukan. Pascakemerdekaan Aljazair, OAS melakukan serangan terencana pada iring-iringan Presiden Prancis. Pimpinan operasi pembunuhan itu adalah Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry. Bastien-Thiry adalah seorang insinyur peralatan udara militer Prancis, dan ia sendiri bukanlah anggota OAS. Percobaan pembunuhan itu gagal. Jean Bastien-Thiry (19 Oktober 1927-11 Maret 1963) akhirnya dijatuhi hukuman mati. Presiden de Gaulle menolak memberikan amnesti pada Bastien-Thirty. Ada tiga orang yang dijatuhi hukuman mati. Jenderal de Gaulle memberikan amnesti pada dua orang, dari hukuman mati menjadi hukuman seumur hidup. Namun, kepada Bastien-Thiry, tetap hukuman mati. Ada lima pertimbangan Gaulle untuk menolak amnesti itu. Pertama, Bastien-Thiry memerintahkan anak buahnya untuk menyerang mobil yang ditumpangi de Gaulle, sementara di dalamnya ada istri de Gaulle, Yvonne de Gaulle yang tidak bersalah. Kedua, Bastien-Thiry membahayakan warga sipil (keluarga Fillon) yang berada di dekat mobil yang membawa de Gaulle. Ketiga, Bastien-Thiry membawa 3 orang warganegara asing (Hongaria) dalam drama pembunuhan itu. Keempat, dalam persidangan, Bastien-Thiry menyatakan bahwa tujuan awal adalah menculik de Gaulle, bukan membunuhnya. Bastien-Thiry membuat suatu kesalahan dengan ""mengejek"" de Gaulle di persidangan dengan mengatakan bahwa ia akan mengambil kacamata dan kawat gigi de Gaulle. Kelima, dalam pandangan de Gaulle, di kala rekan-rekan Bastien-Thiry sedang melakukan pekerjaan berbahaya menembaki mobil de Gaulle, Bastien-Thiry hanya mengamati dari jauh. 
 Fredrick Forsyth membuat kisah fiksi melanjutkan cerita di atas. Pascakegagalan OAS membunuh de Gaulle, pimpinan OAS berembuk kembali memantapkan rencananya. Pimpinan OAS tertinggi adalah Kolonel Antoine Argoud. Setelah ia ditangkap di Jerman oleh Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage (SDECE), otomatis wakilnya yang menjadi pemimpin yaitu Kolonel Marc Rodin. Berdasarkan pengalaman sebelumnya, Rodin memutuskan tidak menggunakan orang dari OAS untuk membunuh presiden. Ia melakukan penelitian sendiri dan memutuskan bersama Rene Montclair dan Andre Casson, 2 orang pimpinan OAS yang lain, untuk menyewa seorang pembunuh profesional yang sama sekali tidak punya ideologi yang sama dengan OAS serta tidak ada dalam catatan kepolisian. Ditentukan seorang yang berasal dari Inggris. Tidak diketahui bagaimana Rodin bisa memperoleh data-tentang si Inggris, yang jelas informasinya sangat terbatas, dan Inggris dianggap jarang berurusan dengan Prancis. Jadi, tujuan pembunuhan seperti di atas menjadi berkembang. Sebelumnya, tujuannya adalah untuk melenyapkan kebijakan politik de Gaulle, dari sisi OAS. Sementara dari sisi si pembunuh bayaran, tujuannya adalah semata-mata demi uang. 
 Pimpinan OAS menetapkan seorang kandidat dari Inggris. Untuk kepentingan itu, Sang Kandidat diterbangkan dari Inggris ke Austria. Di sebuah hotel yang dijaga dengan ketat, mereka berdiskusi. Kandidat pembunuh tersebut meminta bayaran yang sangat besar. Besaran uang yang diminta sebesar US$ 500.000. Sandi yang digunakan pada Orang Inggris itu adalah The Jackal. Dari uraian di novel ini, sangat sedikit keterangan mengenai si Jackal. Disebutkan bahwa ia seorang jangkung, kurus, tinggi 6 kaki, berambut pirang, serta mempunyai kemampuan menembak yang jitu. 
 Pihak Dinas Rahasia Prancis melaporkan bahwa Rodin dkk bersembunyi di sebuah hotel. Mereka berkomunikasi dengan surat dengan sandi khusus: Partrier. Pengawal mereka berasal dari legiun asing yang bernama Viktor Kowalski. Dinas Rahasia Prancis menjebak Viktor dengan mengabarkan bahwa putrinya sakit. Viktor ditangkap, dan dari interogasi diperoleh kesimpulan bahwa OAS menyewa pembunuh profesional untuk membunuh Presiden Prancis. Keterangan yang diperoleh dari Viktor sangat minim. Hanya berupa kata Jackal. 
 Di Inggris, Si Jangkung Pirang sedang berusaha untuk mendapatkan dokumen palsu. Ia mendatangi sebuah pemakaman keluarga, dan ia melihat nama-nama di batu nisan yang tanggal lahirnya kira-kira sama dengan dirinya. Ia menemukan Alexander Duggan di sebuah batu nisan. Ia mendatangi gereja di sekitar untuk menanyakan informasi terkait Duggan. Ia membuat keterangan palsu kepada pastor gereja dengan mengatakan bahwa ia adalah kerabat Duggan. Ia mendapatkan nama ayah dan ibu Duggan yang sebenarnya. Kemudian membuat akte kelahiran palsu yang fotonya ia samakan dengan dirinya. Ia juga mendatangi pembuat dokumen paspor palsu. 
 Di Prancis, dewan khusus dibentuk untuk menangkal si Jackal. Dewan tersebut diketuai oleh Roger Frey, Menteri Dalam Negeri. Inspektur Lebel ditunjuk sebagai pemimpin operasi pencegahan. Inspektur Lebel mengirimkan pesan ke rekannya sesama polisi di negara lain untuk memberitahu bahwa apakah ada seseorang berbahaya di negara mereka. Lebel juga memerintahkan supaya semua orang asing yang memasuki Prancis agar diperiksa. Dari Inggris dikabarkan bahwa orang yang diduga sebagai The Jackal adalah Charles Calthrop. Ada kemiripan pelafalan. Jackal dalam Bahasa Prancis disebut ChaCal, sama dengan inisial Charles Calthrop. 
 Mungkin si Forsyth boleh narsis dengan negerinya, Inggris. Polisi Inggris, Bryn Thomas, mengidentifikasi bahwa The Jackal (sebelumnya diduga Charles Calhtrop) telah memasuki Prancis dengan nama Alexander Duggan. Jika tanpa ada informasi dari polisi Inggris, maka Jackal akan leluasa masuk ke Prancis sesuai rencana sebelumnya. Jackal dibantu oleh mata-mata OAS yang bersandi Valmy. Valmy sendiri diberikan informasi oleh rekan yang kebetulan adalah teman wanita Saint Clair, salah seorang anggota dewan. 
 Sebelum memasuki Prancis, Jackal diberitahu bahwa identitasnya sebagai Duggan telah ketahuan. Karena itu, ia berganti identitas menjadi Pendeta Denmark. Lebel merasa ada yang janggal dengan keberadaan Jackal yang selalu lebih dahulu berhasil melarikan diri sebelum tim Lebel datang. Ia mensinyalir ada informasi bocor dari rapat dewan. Pada suatu kesempatan rapat, Lebel memperdengarkan rekaman suara telepon antara Valmy dan seorang wanita. Saint Clair mengakui bahwa wanita itu adalah temannya, dan segera mengundurkan diri. 
 Gbr. Mobil Alfa Romeo 
 Forsyth sangat piawai menceritakan detil kisah yang diperankan oleh Jackal dan Lebel. Pembaca dibawa ke suasana di sekitar hotel tempat Jackal menginap, mobil alfa romeo, berganti warna rambut, menyiapkan paspor palsu, membawa koper. Demikian juga suasana ketika Lebel sedang berpikir menangkap Jackal, suasana dalam rapat dewan, berdiskusi dengan wakilnya, serta upaya-upaya yang dilakukan untuk mencegah Jackal masuk ke Paris. Semuanya ditulis dengan detil termasuk dengan nama-nama tokohnya yang banyak sekali.

 Pilihan 
 Kembali pada soal pilihan hidup, Forsyth memberi gambaran tokoh dalam novel ini sebagai sebuah pilihan. Jackal memilih sebagai pembunuh profesional, sedangkan Claude memilih sebagai detektif profesional. Mereka sama-sama cerdas, dan sama-sama memiliki dedikasi yang tinggi pada profesi mereka. Terlepas apakah pilihan mereka berkaitan dengan nilai-nilai etika, paling tidak mereka mengerjakannya dengan sungguh-sungguh. Jackal menyiapkan perencanaan dengan matang. Ia masuk ke perpustakaan, membaca kliping koran, membaca ensiklopedia, menghubungi pembuat senjata dan pemalsu dokumen. Satu hal yang dapat ditiru adalah bahwa Jackal adalah tipe perencana yang ulung serta pekerja keras. Kelemahan Jackal dalam cerita ini adalah kemampuan berdiskusi dan bernegosiasinya tidak memadai. Hampir mirip dengan Jackal, Claude Lebel juga adalah tipe pekerja keras. Satu hal yang dapat ditiru adalah ia tipe pantang menyerah. Lebel berani melakukan apa yang dianggapnya baik walaupun itu tidak disetujui oleh rapat dewan. Satu lagi rekan Lebel yang tipe pekerja keras adalah rekan polisi di Inggris, yaitu Bryn Thomas. Demi mendapat informasi tentang Jackal, ia mengerahkan semua kemampuan di timnya. Hasilnya tidak sia-sia. Nama Duggan yang digunakan oleh Jackal, diperoleh dari polisi Inggris ini. 
 Pilihan itu kembali pada manusia itu sendiri. Manakah yang ia pilih? Dengan segala risiko dan keuntungan yang sudah diperhitungkan, pilihan diputuskan. Novel ini memang ""miskin"" bicara masalah kemanusiaan. Demi pencapaian tujuan, tokoh-tokohnya sedikit menggunakan perasaan dan hatinya. Namun, pada suatu wawancara Forsyth mengembalikan itu semua pada pembaca, berikut kutipannya. 
 I'm not telling humanity how to run itself. I'm describing how a bit of humanity runs itself. You want to be surprised, be surprised. You want to be horrified, be horrified. It's your choice, not mine.

 Kisah di Balik Penulisan Novel 
 Frederick Forsyth terkenal dengan membuat novel thriller. Kisah Jackal ini ditulis ketika ia berusia duapuluhan. Ia bercita-cita menjadi pilot, dan bergabung dengan Royal Air Force (RAF), angkatan udara bergengsi Inggris. Ambisi keduanya adalah berkeliling dunia. Ia bekerja sebagai jurnalis di kantor berita Reuters. Ia bertugas di Afrika, Jerman Barat, Jerman Timur, dan Cekoslowakia sebagai jurnalis asing. Lewat profesinya ini, ia berkesempatan ke Afrika meliput perang Aljazair. Pengalamannya meliput perang memberi inspirasi baginya untuk menulis novel ini. Motivasi awalnya dalam menulis novel adalah ia menemukan bahwa novel yang dibacanya tidak disertai dengan penelitian yang mendalam. Ia berkeinginan menulis novel berdasarkan riset yang ia lakukan sendiri. Berbekal pengalaman jurnalistiknya di Reuters dan terutama ketika meliput perang Aljazair, ia menulis novel ini. Selain itu, motivasi Forsyth menulis novel The Jackal adalah karena uang. sebab ketika ia pulang dari Afrika, ia berhenti dari pekerjaannya dan ia tidak memiliki uang. 
 Seperti The Jackal yang keluar masuk perpustakaan, Forsyth juga masuk ke perpustakaan Prancis untuk memperoleh informasi/data-data yang dibutuhkan. Sebagai wartawanpun, ia pernah mewawancarai pimpinan OAS. Pada suatu kesempatan wawancara dengan pimpinan OAS pernah mengatakan ""the moment when a sniper got him through the forehead."" Hal itu tidak pernah terjadi selanjutnya, namun hal itu menjadi ide cerita The Jackal ini. Ketika bertugas di Prancis, Forsyth juga menyaksikan kerusuhan jalanan yang menentang kemerdekaan Aljazair. Forsyth juga masuk ke sindikat pemalsu dokumen di Inggris, ia mendalami seluk beluk pemalsuan paspor di Inggris. Banyaknya imigran gelap di Inggris disinyalir karena menggunakan dokumen paspor palsu melalui agen-agen itu, namun Pemerintah Inggris baru menutup tuntas 'celah' itu di tahun 2003. Sungguh waktu yang sangat lama. Selain itu, ketika ia bertugas sebagai jurnalis di Nigeria pada 1969, ia banyak bertemu dengan prajurit bayaran. Ia banyak mengetahui bagaimana Eropa bawah tanah, bagaimana mendapatkan senapan penembak buatan, bagaimana mematahkan leher seseorang, dan semua informasi dan pengetahuan itu ia ramu dalam novel ini. 
 Novel ini juga menjadi inspirasi bagi pembunuh Yitzhak Rabin (!995). Terjemahan bahasa Ibrani novel ini ditemukan di tempat tinggal Yigal Amir, si pembunuh Rabin. Ilich Ramirez Sanchez alias Carlos the Jackal terinspirasi novel menjadi teroris paling berbahaya di Amerika Selatan. 
 Menurut saya, terjemahan novel ini cukup baik. Cuma agak kurang konsisten antara judul dengan isi. Di judul menggunakan kata Jackal, sementara di isi buku digunakan nama Jakal. Seolah membuat Jackal lebih mengindonesia, tetapi kurang konsisten pada tokoh lain yang tetap mempertahankan nama aslinya. Selain itu, ada kata ""berabe"", ""dong"", ""sih"" yang menurut saya lolos dari mata editor. 
 Kembali ke novel, Forsyth tetap berpegang bahwa novelnya haruslah berdasarkan riset dan fakta. Secara kekuatan, Jackal dan Lebel tidak seimbang. Lebel didukung oleh ratusan bahkan ribuan anak buah serta dukungan rekan polisi dari berbagai negara. Sementara Jackal hanya seorang diri dan bantuan informan. Namun, fakta menunjukkan bahwa Aljazair tetaplah sebuah negara merdeka yang tidak tergoyahkan lagi hingga saat ini. Bila kita menyaksikan beberapa video di youtube yang menayangkan banyaknya korban rakyat Aljazair akibat perang antara FLN dan pasukan Prancis, maka sungguhlah tepat keputusan de Gaulle untuk membiarkan Aljazair sebagai negara sendiri.

Rex has always fostered a bleak view of humans. He suspects the world would be better off without our species. So when a virus, designed to make pests develop an insatiable appetite for their own kind, affects humans instead, it is as though Rex's wish has come horribly true. With his dog, Soldier, he wanders a devastated landscape armed with a gun and only one bullet. Days-long car chases ... shoot-outs ... cannibalism ... unyielding desert sun.
His situation deteriorating, he seeks solace in recalling life before, with his girlfriend. But as these flashbacks become increasingly real, and fuse with the murderous present, are they more than memories? Should he turn the gun on himself or has he, his relationship, and humanity got one more shot?

In ""A Choice of Accommodations,"" a husband's attempt to turn an old friend's wedding into a romantic getaway weekend with his wife takes a dark, revealing turn as the party lasts deep into the night. In ""Only Goodness,"" a sister eager to give her younger brother the perfect childhood she never had is overwhelmed by guilt, anguish, and anger when his alcoholism threatens her family. And in ""Hema and Kaushik,"" a trio of linked stories--a luminous, intensely compelling elegy of life, death, love, and fate--we follow the lives of a girl and boy who, one winter, share a house in Massachusetts. They travel from innocence to experience on separate, sometimes painful paths, until destiny brings them together again years later in Rome.

 Atwood creates a very engaging story of the lives of two women, Ren and Toby and how their experiences with ""God's Gardeners"" impact their futures. The gardeners' religion is wonderfully crafted, with a well-established doctrine that provides the women with skills and experiences that become more and more useful as the plot advances. I loved all the ways in which Atwood integrates the lost knowledge of our environment, from the free food we could forage to the dangerous poisons growing should we need them. In an age where food is so taken for granted it is always interesting to ponder what would happen if our supplies dried up, and how little we know of the world around us. 
 The story is woven wonderfully around the plot of Oryx and Crake, and although the plot does not advance and further in time-scale it is still immensely engaging to view the whole story from a completely different viewpoint.

For eighteen years, Jude Farraday has put her children's needs above her own, and it shows--her twins, Mia and Zach, are bright and happy teenagers. When Lexi Baill moves into their small, close knit community, no one is more welcoming than Jude. Lexi, a former foster child with a dark past, quickly becomes Mia's best friend. Then Zach falls in love with Lexi and the three become inseparable.

In the years that follow, each must face the consequences of that single night and find a way to forget...or the courage to forgive.

They lived the series, almost literally as it took over 20 years from book one to book seven. And, of course, when Mr. King was nearly killed by that accident with the van, many wondered if the saga would ever be complete. I feel Mr. King, himself, wondered the same thing. 
 But as for me, I was a late comer to the show. I have been reading Stephen King for many years now but it was only 2 years ago that I began this series. I knew it was ""complete"" before I began and would therefore be ""safe"" for me to plunge into what has been described as King's masterwork, his magnum opus. As I worked my way through the novels I recognized two major things. First, these novels would not be my favorite of Mr. King's work. For me they weren't always enjoyable reading nor make me feel good, but they would definitely make me ""feel"". Second, I would be as humbled as I could possibly be to see how an author can create something so amazingly complex, and vast in scope and yet keep my attention focused on the tiny aspects of what really matters. 
 This seventh novel in the series was not perfect. At times it seemed to need editing and at times I got a little lost as the complexity threatened to overwhelm me. Many readers were disappointed in the ending but I felt it was just right for this epic series. Few novels have moved me so much as this one nor had me thinking about it so much when I wasn't even actively reading it.

When Father Nathan O'Brien is arrested for refusing to preach the messages mandated by the Religious Unity Agency, Michael Linton and Jeff Conners call attention to abuses of government power by setting up ""The Wall"", a website which publishes the names of all those who have vanished. Soon, the entire country is talking about the problems of indefinite detention, but before long, the Electronic Communications' Agency dubs ""The Wall"" the greatest act of terrorism in U.S. history and arrests Michael and Jeff as domestic terrorists.
With Michael and Jeff gone, Michael's wife Kris and her brother Keith know that the time has come for them to stand up for the Constitution and fight for the laws of our country.",Fiction,Excellent,1,3,10,4.425,6,3.7,57,4.0,"""The Chosen"" by Alexandra and Joyce Swann is a fascinating glimpse at what happens when autocratic leadership violates human rights and freedoms. As the story opens Kris Mitchell Linton's husband Michael and his friend Jeff Connors have been arrested by Federal Agents for assisting in the creation of a website called ""The Wall"" which lists hundreds of Americans who have been detained without any evidence or a trial. With the help of a smart, God-fearing Constitutional lawyer Kris files a suit against the government for violation of articles in the Constitution dealing with unlawful arrest and imprisonment without the right to a trial. Like the Maccabees revolt in 168BC against the cruel and dictatorial leadership of Antiochus Epiphanies who forbade the worship of the God of Israel and desecrated the Temple, Kris, her brother Keith and their friends Jessie and Kyle stand up against the tyrannical policy of an arrogant despot, President Tom Quincy. 
 This is a riveting story about a nation on the brink of disaster not only because of a government's abuse of power and injustice, but also because of peoples' complacency when they drift away from the principles and faith their county was founded on. Yet within the darkness of corruption and turmoil there shines a light engendered by the faith, courage and the self-sacrifice of a few willing to stand against an evil that would destroy their rights and freedoms. 
 This is a well-written and spellbinding story that flows naturally as the abuse of the government grows and tension mounts in a legal battle that will make history and determine the fate of thousands. The personalities of the characters are multi-faceted and draw the reader deeper into their emotional turmoil. Kris Mitchell Linton fears for the life of her child and husband, but looks to her faith for strength and courage. She's determined and resilient, willing to sacrifice her life if it means helping thousands incarcerated unjustly. Keith Mitchell, crippled spiritually by the loss of his wife and child struggles with his doubts and fears, but is determined to protect his family and friends. Julian Cicchetti is the brilliant Constitutional lawyer whose faith is tested, and whose career and life are jeopardized when he tackles a case that seems unwinnable. 
 Even the secondary characters are as important and unforgettable to the story as those in the forefront of the fight against the government. Among them are Father Nathan O'Brien, a man of strong faith willing to pay the price for not conforming to the government's liturgical standards; Michael Linton and Jeff Connors determined and brave in their stand against oppression. Even the antagonists heighten this emotionally-charged story with their arrogance, pride and hunger for power; Vice President Peters, a woman whose moral compass has been undermined by a philandering husband and President Tom Quincy, a type of anti-Christ with his lust for power and authority.

When The Alienistwas first published in 1994, it was a major phenomenon, spending six months on the New York Timesbestseller list, receiving critical acclaim, and selling millions of copies. This modern classic continues to be a touchstone of historical suspense fiction for readers everywhere.
The year is 1896. The city is New York. Newspaper reporter John Schuyler Moore is summoned by his friend Dr. Laszlo Kreizler--a psychologist, or ""alienist""--to view the horribly mutilated body of an adolescent boy abandoned on the unfinished Williamsburg Bridge. From there the two embark on a revolutionary effort in criminology: creating a psychological profile of the perpetrator based on the details of his crimes. Their dangerous quest takes them into the tortured past and twisted mind of a murderer who will kill again before their hunt is over.
Fast-paced and riveting, infused with historical detail, The Alienistconjures up Gilded Age New York, with its tenements and mansions, corrupt cops and flamboyant gangsters, shining opera houses and seamy gin mills.

My sister came across this book again and decided that she wanted to keep it (she still hadn't had a chance to read it). 
 When I was looking for books for the WriYe Reading Challenge, I came across The Alienist in a list of books that fall into the Horror/Thriller category. I figured: Hey, I own it and here's a ""reason"" to read it. So, I added it to my list of books to read for this year. 
 As I was reading the book, I was reminded of Criminal Minds - with the whole plot of this book, that's not too surprising. However, it fits exactly the flavor of this book and tells you something about it: it's not horror and I wouldn't call it a thriller either. It's more like a suspense novel. It's not scary. It just keeps you at the edge of your seat, trying to see where the case will lead. 
 Now, this is not to say that I didn't enjoy the book. Quite the contrary: it was great and I'm going to add the other book with these characters to my list for next year. I really enjoyed the characterization and I appreciated how historically accurate everything was. I felt like I learned a lot - about history and psychological forensics of the time without being bogged down with so much information that it detracted from the story. 
 So, if you enjoy television shows like Criminal Minds, I'd definitely recommend this book to you. If you're looking for something scary... you might pass this by, however.",0.0,0,4752,33216.48,6.99,498,4,4,5

 A genius author who has entered into the minds of a fictional North Korean world and characters. The author has bodily visited North Korea; nevertheless, in such a closed society much of what he has written had to come from slim data points enlarged by imagination. 
 Feel free to ignore my advice, but here it is anyway: Don't undertake this reading adventure if you feel traumatized already in your life. 
 If you do decide to read this one, be prepared for an emotional read that the author has labeled trauma fiction. 
 I am not sure what that means, but don't be surprised if you feel a bit traumatized after inhabiting the reading world with the main character Jun Do (the Korean everyman... think ""John Doe."") 
 There are moments of absurdity that might be described as humorous if it weren't all so painfully tragic. 
 The reference point for our ""hero"" Jun is survival -- survival in a world where trust is a risky concept, where logic and reason are not firm possibilities, where the outward behaviors and words are not at all a reliable manifestation of a person's inner world even between parents and children, where a society is constructed around a powerful leader's self-centered delusions and misinformation. 
 Honest intimacy, when it appears to appear in the story, creates a revolutionary, transformative possibility. But can it be believed? 
 I found parts utterly gripping.

155,The Day Of The Jackal,Frederick Forsyth,1971,2011,"Copy-editor: 
Seorang pria Inggris yang hanya dikenal dengan nama sandi: Jakal, disewa oleh organisasi pemberontak Prancis untuk membunuh Presiden Charles de Gaulle. Sebelumnya, upaya-upaya pembunuhan terhadap sang presiden selalu gagal. Informasi dan perencanaannya bocor ke tangan pemerintah lewat agen-agen yang disusupkan ke dalam organisasi rahasia tersebut.
Namun, kali ini serangan sang Jakal akan benar-benar rahasia dan mematikan!
Tidak ada satu pun arsip dan data yang dimiliki oleh pihak keamanan Prancis dan bahkan dinas rahasia di seluruh dunia terhadap pembunuh bayaran profesional top dunia ini. Tidak diketahui kapan, di mana, dan bagaimana sang Jakal akan beraksi. Perburuan pun dilakukan. Semua sumber daya keamanan dan informasi dikerahkan hanya untuk memburu satu orang yang tak bernama dan tak jelas pula ciri-ciri fisiknya. Namun yang pasti, nyawa sang presiden menjadi taruhannya dan Komisaris Claude Lebel, detektif terbaik Prancis, harus berpacu dengan waktu untuk meringkusnya.
Novel thriller terbaik di kelasnya ini telah mengilhami banyak peristiwa serupa di berbagai belahan dunia. Diceritakan dengan mendetail, seru, dan menegangkan, membuat Anda enggan meletakkannya sebelum membacanya sampai halaman terakhir.",Fiction,Excellent,36,1,8,2.9722222222222223,14,4.25,57,4.0,"Sebuah buku yang memiliki pengaruh kuat bagi pembacanya mungkin adalah buku yang hebat. Sebut saja the Catcher in The Rye, yang menginspirasi Mark David Chapman untuk membunuh John Lennon pada musim dingin 8 Desember 1980. Hal semacam juga terjadi pada buku The Day of the Jackal yang ditemukan diantara barang-barang milik Yigal Amir, pembunuh perdana menteri Israel, Yitzhak Rabin. 
 Seorang anonim, yang menamakan dirinya Jackal, diberi tugas oleh OAS (Organisation de l'Armee Secrete) untuk membunuh presiden Perancis. Upahnya sebesar $500.000, dengan pembayaran setengah di muka dan setengah lagi bila operasi berhasil. Frederick Forsyth dengan lihai memilih sudut pengambilan gambar untuk pembacanya, sehingga selama membaca buku ini, kita layaknya sedang menonton sebuah film. 
 Satu per satu rencana si pembunuh dikuak secara perlahan-lahan. Kita dibiarkan mengintip persiapan apa saja yang dilakukan si pembunuh yang teliti ini untuk melancarkan misinya. Pembaca juga sengaja dibisiki rencana-rencana polisi Perancis dalam menyelediki pelaku pembunuhan guna mencegah penembakan presiden terjadi. Dengan diperlihatkannya 2 sudut pandang ini, saya yakin pembaca akan memilih superheronya masing-masing. 
 Saya sendiri, jujur, mau tak mau mendukung si pembunuh agar berhasil dalam misinya. Si pembunuh, karena memang digambarkan sebagai tokoh sentral sepanjang cerita, memiliki kesan dan karakter yang lebih kuat untuk menarik simpati pembaca dibandingkan dengan pahlawan dari kepolisian Perancis. Saya ikut berdebar-debar saat identitas si pembunuh hampir saja ketahuan, bahkan saya harus menahan diri untuk tidak berkata pada si pembunuh, "" Jangan ke sana.. nanti ketahuan.. awasss.. !"". Sebegitu nyatanya penggambaran suasana yang Mr. Forsyth lakukan, sehingga seolah-olah saya sendiri larut dan masuk ke dalam buku, bersama dengan si Pembunuh. 
 Harus saya katakan bahwa pada awalnya saya tidak terlalu menikmati buku ini, karena ini adalah genre thriller saya yang pertama (sepertinya). Namun semakin saya membuka halaman selanjutnya, semakin saya sadar bahwa ternyata membaca buku ini sangat nikmat. Susah untuk meletakkan buku ini, dan saat-saat tidak membaca buku ini adalah saat-saat saya berpikir dan mengira-ngira, si pembunuh ini sudah sampai mana ya.. sedang apa ya.. Ah, benar-benar pantas kalau buku ini saya beri 4 sapi. 
 Untuk penggemar trhiller, saya yakin buku ini akan menjadi sajian istimewa. Perlu diketahui bahwa Charles De Gaulle, OAS, SDECE, dan Bastien-Thiry adalah fakta. Sedangkan unsur-unsur lain dalam buku ini didapatkan dari pengalaman Mr. Forsyth selama menjadi reporter Reuter di Perancis. Sekedar pengetahuan saja, The Jackal ini benar-benar menjadi julukan seorang pembunuh bernama Illich Ramirez Sanchez a.k.a Carlos the Jackal. 
 Orang ini adalah teroris komunis, orang yang kikuk dan seorang playboy yang sangat beruntung karena tidak pernah tertangkap dalam waktu lama. Hmm... sangat beda jauh dengan si Jackal yang difilmkan pada tahun 1973 ya.",0.0,0,4671,4624.29,0.99,508,4,5,4

Both the lists were published in the nineties and feature some of the finest specimens of crime writing. The lists can be found here - Link 
 The story is narrated by Rozat K. Sabich aka Rusty, chief deputy prosecutor of Kindle county who is also the protagonist. The story begins with the murder of Carolyn, another prosecuting attorney, with whom Rusty had an affair and never got over his obsession of her. Rusty gets the responsibility of investigating the crime but himself ends up getting accused of the murder and faces trial. 
 The book features some really great court room scenes, complex characters and portrays so many human emotions and frailties. Illicit passion, betrayal, corruption, dirty politics, jealousy, friendship, paternal feelings, family bonds - everything finds a place in the story. The author has also explained quite a few legal technicalities which makes it easier for the reader to understand some of the complexities of the trial. The mystery is excellent and the very few would be able to guess the identity of the culprit. 
 Rusty, accustomed to putting criminals behind bars, is now the accused and feels how is it to be on the other side. He talks about his obsession with Carolyn, his childhood, his strained relationship with his wife, his fear of missing out his son's childhood if he is sent to prison. Some of his ramblings is actually a bit boring and do not fit in the story.The author's use of the English language is impressive but somehow I felt at times it was not compatible with the character or the story. e.g. a person, who is a prosecutor not a poet, facing a murder charge is unlikely to use phrases like ""doors and windows of my soul are thrown open to a fundamental gratitude"". It is my only criticism of the novel.

Running for his life, but not before he picks up a bloodstained letter opener that puts the president at the scene of the crime, the burglar becomes the target of a clandestine manhunt orchestrated by leading members of the executive branch.
Meanwhile, Jack Graham, once a public defender and now a high-powered corporate attorney, gets drawn into the case because the on-the-lam burglar just happens to be the father of his former financee, a crusading Virginia prosecutor.
Embroidering the narrative through assorted plot whorls are the hero's broken romance; his conflict over selling out for financial success; the prosecutor's confused love-hate for her burglar father; the relentless investigation by a northern Virginia career cop; the dilemma of government agents trapped in a moral catch-22; the amoral ambitions of a sexy White House Chief of Staff; and the old burglar's determination to bring down the ruthless president.

 I'm always amused by the amount of ammunition available to survivors of zombie apocalypses. There always seems to be a never ending supply of ammo. 
 I liked that the author had a diverse cast of characters, from all walks of life. No one was safe from becoming zombie fodder, either. It amazes me which type of character rises to the top of the heap in these types of novels, too. 
 I enjoyed the story, although I had a little difficulty understanding the origin of the zombie contagion. All of a sudden, people were getting ill and then becoming violent. They then bit another person who reanimated as a zombie. But - where did it come from? Why? 
 Also - using nuclear weapons to get rid of zombies? That's a new one. So now I need to add a few other things to my zombie survival kit - an old car without any electronics, able to outlast an electro-magnetic pulse.

When his powers are discovered, he finds himself purchased and freed by a Prince and apprenticed to the royal wizard, Ildar. His duty is to stay chaste to keep his powers strong. Unfortunately, his passion is for Severin. With kingdoms at war, the throne hanging in the balance, and magic in the air, can the two men find happiness together, or is duty more important than love?",Fiction,Excellent,39,1,10,4.425,5,3.21,31,3.0,"The Chosen is a classic fantasy novel but without the epic length. Included are long journeys, prophesies, royalty, magic, oracles, wars at stake, forbidden love, runaway elopements, long lost princes, lengthy quests, true love, and a happy ending. Because the story stays pretty true to the fantasy origins, there is not originality offered but for those fans of the genre, the familiar themes are always welcome. The writing makes the story incredibly easy and fast to read so that kept my interest whereas if the pace had dragged I would have been bored. The characters are again right out of fantasy lore so nothing surprising but they are warm and likable. As a first novel, this is a decent fantasy offering that may be of interest to classic fantasy tales. 
 Severin is a prince out on a journey with his faithful wizard Ildar to find himself after a lifetime of being spoiled at his parent's whim. Severin buys Havyn at a slave auction, intending to free the man once they return to his home. Along the way, they discover Havyn has magical ability and Ildar quickly makes the ex-slave his new wizard's apprentice. Life isn't easy once they reach home though as Severin is set to wed the niece of a neighboring land, yet his chemistry with Havyn causes havoc for both. When the royal family and entourage set out for the betrothal ceremony, there is no end of problems. Murder, intrigue, runaways, long lost royalty, quests, true love, and a happy ending are all involved as the various characters find their way in this realm of magic and mystery. 
 There is a lot going on in this story but surprisingly, the plot never feels overwhelmed or too fast. Each issue brought up is well handled and builds upon the next so each piece is simply part of a bigger, more complicated whole. Some of the elements are pretty predictable and the story on the whole isn't wildly original. Often the plot feels obvious as the fantasy themes used are easy to identify so there is not a lot of suspense or wonder associated with reading. Yet the writing keeps the pace quick and characters interesting enough that even those who have read this type of story all the time will keep turning the page here. 
 Part of this is that the characters are pretty decent. Severin and Havyn narrate the story in alternating third person point of view and for the most part they stay well within the predictable roles. Havyn is slightly over the top with the orphan childhood sold into slavery from birth and never known a bath, clothing, food, or kindness. However this exaggeration is pretty typical of everyone in the book. All the characters seem to exist on the extremes of their description and supposedly almost all are virgins, which is necessary to fill their various roles. This is a bit of a stretch especially at the end when several of these mandates are flipped to provide a happy ending, but it didn't really bother me since it was clearly coming. 
 The various characters have a bit of charm, a bit of scheming, and some interest which kept me reading even though I knew what would happen - usually a sign I give up and become bored. Yet again, there's an ease to the writing that lets you enjoy the classic tale even if there is nothing surprising. The common themes are well loved for a reason and even though just about all used here, it pretty much works. This isn't a book that leaves you breathless but it is one you enjoy while reading. Or at least I mostly did.",7.0,1,4320,8596.8,1.99,1099,4,5,3
168,The Reckoning,John Grisham,2018,2011,"To the public, he's a hero: a killer who targets convicted paedophiles. Two men are dead already - tortured to death.Even the police don't regard the cases as a priority. Most feel that two dead paedophiles is a step in the right direction. But to DC Maeve Kerrigan, no one should be allowed to take the law into their own hands. Young and inexperienced, Kerrigan wants to believe that murder is murder no matter what the sins of the victim. Only, as the killer's violence begins to escalate, she is forced to confront exactly how far she's prepared to go to ensure justice is served...",Fiction,Excellent,22,1,14,4.909090909090909,10,3.96,105,4.0,"The Reckoning is the second book in the Maeve Kerrigan series and though not quite as good a read as the debut, still an interesting read nonetheless. 
 This time paeodophiles are being brutally murdered and no obvious reasoning is forthcoming. Kerrigan and the team are put onto the case and soon enough the bodies start piling up. About halfway through the book the storyline takes on a different turn sending the whole thing into a different direction. It was cleverly done and not an obvious route to follow. I enjoyed the book for the most part but did think some parts of the book were stretched out a little. Too much detail at times that wasn't really necessary and I would actually prefer shorter chapters to keep the flow and momentum going. Occasionally I would wonder into 'when is this chapter finishing?' territory as chapters would sometimes drag on. The second half of the book really picks up pace and this is where it really held my attention and I didn't want to put the book down until the end. 
 Maeve Kerrigan herself is a likeable character albeit her decisions at times leaves the head shaking. She isn't perfect my any means, quick tempered and could do with thinking before acting rationally but she has a flair for the job and is growing on me as her character develops through the books. 
 I'm hoping the next book in the series picks up a little but I have to say I'm really enjoying getting to know the rest of the characters in the Murder Squad - even DI Derwent!! Looking forward to the next one.

169,The Messenger,Daniel Silva,2006,2009,"This teen gem about an unambitious teenager whose life is suddenly turned upside down by anonymous messages has it all - mystery, humor, romance, friendship.
Meet Ed Kennedy - underage cab driver, pathetic card palyer, and useless at romance. He lives in a shack, and he's hopelessly in love with his best friend, Audrey. His life is one of peaceful routine and incompetence, until he inadvertently stops a bank robbery. That's when the first Ace arrives...That's when Ed becomes the messenger.
Chosen to care, he makes his way through town helping and hurting (when necessary), until only one question remains. Who's behind Ed's mission?",Fiction,Excellent,6,3,12,5.833333333333333,4,4.09,352,4.0,"""Believe it or not-it takes a lot of love to hate you like this."" 
 This book isn't easy to digest. The plot is original, the protagonist is at the same time your everyday guy and quite unique, but the love interest totally failed to impress me and the love story is forced. While this is an emotional read, it somehow failed to evoke some genuine feeling. But I still like the book very much, it's weird. 
 The novel starts off with one of the best first chapters I have ever encountered - a bank robbery. Unfortunately, the book never reached that high mark of suspense again, but it was entertaining nonetheless. Ed is your average guy who lives in the relatively poor neighborhood and wastes his time. He has best friends, a bit complicated relationships with his mother, brother and sisters. Also, there is a girl that he's in love with and one very smelly dog. And then, one day, everything changes and he becomes the Messenger. Ed must figure out who is in a need of help and what he can do to touch their lives. He is sent out on various missions and is tested with playing cards that contain the messages he is supposed to deliver. As Ed incorporates himself into these strangers' lives, he learns to care for them deeply and ultimately discovers a message for them that will change their lives. His best friends friends are Marv (the most entertaining character in the book), Ritchie and Audrey (the girl he's in love with). His roommate is his 17 year old dog called Doorman. Ed gets the third card and I really wished for something new to happen. 
 Despite the amazing first chapter, the novel nonetheless had a slow start. The characters are fun and appealing and they still represent the average person you can meet on the street. It was a little repetitive for me at times though, as the narrator deciphered his cards and delivered his messages, but I loved the illustrative ways he described emotions. Please don't go into this book expecting it to be anything like The Book Thief. These two books are nothing alike and have completely different messages. It so hard to compare them, since they're so drastically different. 
 Ed is a taxi driver who has no real life goals and there is nothing distinctive about him. He lives in the same town where he grew up, hangs out playing cards with the same three friends and is the unsuccessful black sheep of the family. Relying on his intuition alone, Ed starts touching people's lives and and yet you don't doubt for a second that his simple deeds make him a better person. As we follow Ed throughout his journey, we see him grow emotionally as the assigments get harder and harder to fulfill. I liked his self-deprecating sense of humor, but the story isn't about him feeling sorry for himself, but instead it's about his growth. Seeing the confidence he gained with every delivered message was so satisfying. Ed is a peculiar guy and it isn't hard to empathize with him, but I hated how passive he really is. 
 ,,It's not a big thing, but I guess it's true - big things are often just small things that are noticed."" 
 It's always the thought that counts. 
 ,,I also fear that nothing really ends at the end. Things just keep going as long as memory can wield its ax, always finding a soft part in your mind to cut through and enter."" 
 Ed had such depressive thoughts at times, that I almost became melancholic myself. 
 ""Ed?"" Ritchie says later. We're still standing in the water. ""There's only one thing I want."" ""What's that, Ritchie?"" His answer is simple. ""To want."" 
 Ritchie's story was so consuming, it's literally my favorite part of the book. 
 The one relationship I hated was the romance. Audrey is my least favorite character in the story, she's almost completely bland and did nothing for the plot. Their bond seemed forced and I saw no reason for them to be anything more than best friends. Audrey's act towards Ed irritated me to no end. She knew he was utterly in love with her and she did nothing to help him get over it. Ed deserves so much better than her.",14.0,1,3969,3929.31,0.99,624,3,3,4

Which is to say, it begins in the forests of ancient Bohemia and doesn't conclude until nine o'clock tonight (Paris time).
It is a saga, as well. A saga must have a hero, and the hero of this one is a janitor with a missing bottle.
The bottle is blue, very, very old, and embossed with the image of a goat-horned god.
If the liquid in the bottle actually is the secret essence of the universe, as some folks seem to think, it had better be discovered soon because it is leaking and there is only a drop or two left.",Fiction,Excellent,11,7,15,10.909090909090908,10,4.24,3888,4.0,"post-read: Ohhhh, I really missed reading Robbins. What fun! 
 This book was both more and less wonderful than I'd remembered. More because I'd forgotten just what a superb stylist Robbins is (see mid-read comments). His plots are intricate, his characters are rendered in wonderful detail, down to the distinctive vocal stylings. His ideas, though perhaps a smidge stale twenty-five years on, are still interesting and fun and clever and smart, intellectual, but not in a showy or pedantic way. Plus there's that anxiety you get when you're, oh, twenty or so pages from the end of a book, thinking There's no way he can pull it all together satisfactorily in so few pages! But he does! It's a tiny bit cheesy, maybe just a wee bit pat, but c'mon. He had an awful lot of balls in the air. 
 Less for a few reasons. I'd kindly blocked out the fact that everyone in a Tom Robbins novel sooner or later launches into a discourse that sounds exactly like Tom Robbins, which can get pretty annoying. Also, I forgot how letchy he can be. There's a lot of sex in this book - in fact, it's one of the four pillars of immortality - which is fine; it's just that the descriptions of it are often a bit much. (""Alma hiccupped the mushroom scent of his spurt,"" ex, not to mention lots of glistening, semen-encrusted thighs, and that sort of thing.) 
 The other thing, which isn't really bad or good, exactly, is that I think Tom Robbins is kind of a victim of himself. He's too much Tom Robbins sometimes. Too hippie-cliche; too cerebral-in-an-understandable-but-trippy-way; too specific with his characters, to the point where they become caricatures that are hard to take seriously; even, sadly, too over-the-top with his metaphors (""his knuckle began rapping at his eye patch like a mongoloid woodpecker drilling for worms in a poker chip""? Are you kidding?); just too... too much. 
 I guess taking a few years off between Robbinses allows one to forget these drawbacks just enough to come back to him fresh and be able to enjoy his shimmering originality again. 
 mid-read: It's not that I'd forgotten, exactly, but no one does metaphors like Tom Robbins. For example: The sky was a velvety black paw pressing on the snowy landscape with a feline delicacy, stars flying like sparks from its fur. Fuck, really??

171,The Underground Railroad,Colson Whitehead,2016,2016,"Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. Life is hellish for all the slaves but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood - where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned and, though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.
In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor - engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven - but the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. Even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.
As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroadis at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.",Fiction,Excellent,37,1,16,7.432432432432432,11,4.03,86839,4.0,"Excellent writing, strong concept.

I wish he had actually done more with the railroad itself. There were some sentences where I thought, ""Now you are just showing off."" The amount of research the author did is clear, throughout.

172,The Day Of The Jackal,Frederick Forsyth,1971,2011,"Copy-editor: 
Seorang pria Inggris yang hanya dikenal dengan nama sandi: Jakal, disewa oleh organisasi pemberontak Prancis untuk membunuh Presiden Charles de Gaulle. Sebelumnya, upaya-upaya pembunuhan terhadap sang presiden selalu gagal. Informasi dan perencanaannya bocor ke tangan pemerintah lewat agen-agen yang disusupkan ke dalam organisasi rahasia tersebut.
Namun, kali ini serangan sang Jakal akan benar-benar rahasia dan mematikan!
Tidak ada satu pun arsip dan data yang dimiliki oleh pihak keamanan Prancis dan bahkan dinas rahasia di seluruh dunia terhadap pembunuh bayaran profesional top dunia ini. Tidak diketahui kapan, di mana, dan bagaimana sang Jakal akan beraksi. Perburuan pun dilakukan. Semua sumber daya keamanan dan informasi dikerahkan hanya untuk memburu satu orang yang tak bernama dan tak jelas pula ciri-ciri fisiknya. Namun yang pasti, nyawa sang presiden menjadi taruhannya dan Komisaris Claude Lebel, detektif terbaik Prancis, harus berpacu dengan waktu untuk meringkusnya.
Novel thriller terbaik di kelasnya ini telah mengilhami banyak peristiwa serupa di berbagai belahan dunia. Diceritakan dengan mendetail, seru, dan menegangkan, membuat Anda enggan meletakkannya sebelum membacanya sampai halaman terakhir.",Fiction,Excellent,36,1,8,2.9722222222222223,14,4.25,57,4.0,"Tentunya kita masih ingat sekitar dua tahun yang lalu Presiden SBY dalam sebuah konferensi pers mengatakan bahwa foto dirinya dijadikan sasaran tembak oleh para teroris yang sedang berlatih. Sebenarnya ini bukanlah hal yang aneh karena para pemimpin negara di berbagai belahan dunia ini seringkali menjadi target utama pembunuhan dari para lawan politiknya. 
 Presiden Soekarno sendiri selama masa pemerintahannya telah tujuh kali mengalami percobaan pembunuhan, begitu juga dengan pemimpin-pemimpin negara lainnya, rekor terbanyak hingga kini dipegang oleh pemimpin Cuba, Fidel Castro dengan 638 kali usaha percobaan pembunuhan terhadapnya. 
 Dari sekian banyak pemimpin dunia yang mendapat ancaman pembunuhan, Charles de Gaulle, (Presiden Perancis 1958-1969) adalah salah satu Presiden yang berkali-kali lolos dari upaya pembunuhan terhdap dirinya. Yang paling terkenal adalah yang terjadi pada tgl 22 Agustus 1962 dimana ia dan istrinya ditembak ketika sedang mengendarai mobil. Rencana pembunuhan ini dikomandoi oleh Kolonel Jean-Marie-Thiry, anggota militer Prancis sekaligus pemimpin OAS (Organisation L'armee Secrete), organisasi tentara rahasia yang berniat bertujuan menjatuhkan de Gaulle karena mereka berpendapat sang Presiden telah menghianati negaranya dengan memberi kemerdekaan kepada Aljazair yang semula merupakan tanah jajahan Prancis. 
 Rencana tersebut gagal, walau terdapat 14 lubang tembakan di mobilnya, Charles de Gaulle dan istrinya selamat dan Kolonel Thiry diganjar hukuman mati oleh pengadilan miltier Prancis pada tahun 1963. Persitiwa inilah yang kemudian mengilhami novelis Inggris Frederick Forsyth untuk menulis novel The Day of The Jackal (1971) 
 Dalam novelnya ini Forsyth mengawali kisahnya saat menjelang dilaksanakannya hukuman mati bagi Kolonel Jean-Marie-Thiry. Kemudian kisah bergerak mundur sejenak ke peristiwa percobaan pembunuhan de Gaulle yang dikomandoi oleh Kolonel Thiry. Paska percobaan pembunuhan yang gagal inilah yang oleh Forsyth dijadikan pijakan awal dalam mengembangkan imajinasinya. 
 Kematian Kolonel Thiry selaku pimpinan OAS tak membuat putus asa anggota-anggotanya. Belajar dari kegagalan-kegagalan sebelumnya, Kolonel Rodin, salah satu petinggi OAS membuat sebuah rencana rahasia untuk mencoba kembali membunuh Presiden de Gaulle melalui jasa seorang pembunuh profesional. Untuk mencegah bocornya rencana ini maka hanya tiga petinggi OAS dan sang pembunuh bayaran yang mengetahuinya. 
 Seluruh rencana pembunuhan diserahkan pada si pembunuh bayaran dari Inggris dengan nama sandi ""Jackal"". OAS hanya menyediakan bayaran yang diminta oleh si jackal yaitu 500 ribu dolar ( Rp. 4,5 Milyar), jumlah yang fantastis di tahun 60an. Setelah menerima uang muka dari OAS, mulailah sang Jackal melakukan berbagai persiapan mulai dari memesan senjata khusus dengan peluru berhulu ledak yang jika mengenai kepala akan menghancurkan segalanya di dalam tulang tengkorak, membuat 4 buah paspor palsu, hingga mempersiapkan perlengkapan penyamaran secara matang. 
 Berkat kejelian kepolisian Prancis, rencana pembunuhan terhadap Presiden de Gaulle kembali tercium, hanya saja kali ini mereka dibuat hampir mati kutu karena yang mereka ketahui hanyalah ciri-ciri fisik si pembunuh yaitu pria Inggris jangkung dengan rambut pirang, selain itu tak ada satu arsip dan data yang dimiliki pihak keamanan Prancis mengenai nama pembunuh, kapan, dimana, dan bagaimana si pembunuh professional ini akan beraksi. 
 Dengan nyawa Presiden sebagai taruhannya, pihak kepolisian Prancis yang dipimpin oleh Claude Lebel, detektif terbaik Prancis dan dibantu oleh kepolisian dari lima negara Eropa plus Amerika dan Afrika bertarung dengan waktu dan kecerdasan si Jackal dalam melaksanakannya tugas yang diembannya. 
 Kaya akan detail 
 Yang membuat novel ini menarik adalah bagaimana Forsyth menghadirkan detail-detail fakta dan peristiwanya. Hal ini bisa jadi keunggulan sekaligus kelemahan dimata pembacanya. Bagi yang menyukai kisah dengan plot cepat hal ini bisa jadi membosankan, terlebih jika pembaca tidak begitu menguasai materi yang dipaparkan si penulis. 
 Contohnya adalah soal senjata rakitan yang dipakai oleh si Jackal. Di sini penulis memaparkan secara detail mulai dari ukuran, jenis logam, alat picu, dsb yang tentunya membuat pembaca yang awam akan senjata jadi bosan, namun bagi mereka yang akrab dengan senjata mungkin hal ini merupakan bagian yang menarik. 
 Selain soal senjata, detail-detail soal pencurian paspor, pembuatan SIM Internasional dan paspor palsu, penyamaran si jackal, bagaimana ia mengelabui petugas keamanan dan imigrasi , cara kerja seorang detektif dalam merangkai data, dan sebagainya juga dibeberkan dalam novel ini. Selain itu penulis juga memaparkan latar belakang politik Prancis di masa pemerintahan Charles de Gaulle yang tentunya akan menambah wawasan pembacanya dalam hal situasi politik Prancis di tahun 60-an. 
 Kesemua itu diramu oleh Forsyth menjadi sebuah kisah triller yang menarik, walau di awal-awal agak terasa membosankan karena detail-detail diatas namun di bag-bab terakhir pembaca akan dibawa pada puncak ketegangan ketika Sang Presiden telah berada dalam bidikan senjata sang Jackal. 
 Di novel ini juga dikisahkan bagaimana Union Corse sebuah sindikat kejahatan yang terorganisir di Prancis yang lebih tua dan berbahaya daripada Mafia Sisilia turut membantu kepolisian Prancis untuk memburu sang Jackal. Sayangnya Forsyth kurang mengeksplorasi keterlibatan Union Corse, kalau saja peran organisasi rahasia ini diberi porsi yang lebih besar novel ini pasti akan lebih menarik lagi. 
 Novel yang berbahaya 
 Saking detailnya penulis memberikan gambaran bagaima sang Jackal mempersiapkan dirinya untuk melaksanakan perkerjaan profersionalnya, buku ini ternyata memberikan dampak yang mungkin tidak terduga oleh Forsyth sebelumnya. 
 Metode untuk mendapatkan paspor palsu yang secara diteil dijelaskan dalam buku ini berhasil ditiru oleh banyak orang. Metode yang akhirnya dikenal dengan istilah ""Day of the Jackal Fraud"" ini kemudian dianggap sebagai celah keamanan paling rentan di Inggris sehingga pemerintah Inggris akhirnya melakukan perubahan besar-besaran dalam birokrasi pengurusan dokumen. 
 Usaha sang Jackal untuk membunuh presiden Prancis juga mengilhami Yigal Amir, seorang militan ekstrem kanan untuk membunuh PM Israel Yithzak Rabin pada 1955. Vladimir Arutnunian yang pada tahun 2005 berencana membunuh Presiden AS George W. Bush mengaku terobsesi untuk melakukan apa yang dilakukan oleh Jackal. 
 Dari fakta-fakta diatas rasanya tak berlebihan kalau novel ini saya anggap sebagai novel yang memikat sekaligus berbahaya! 
 Sejarah Penerbitan dan Adaptasi film 
 The Day of The Jackal karya Frederick Forsyth ini pertama kali diterbitkan di Inggris pada 1971 oleh penerbit Huthcinson dan langsung menjadi best seller. Di tahun 1972 novel ini meraih penghargaan novel terbaik Edgar Allan Poe.

 Di Indonesia sendiri novel ini setidaknya telah 2 kali diterjemahkan, di tahun 1977 The Day of The Jackal l pernah diterbitkan oleh Gramedia setelah sebelumnya muncul sebagai sebagai cerita bersambung di Koran KOMPAS. Pada thun 2004 novel ini juga diterbitkan dalam dua jilid oleh penerbit Alice Saputra Comunication dengan judul Beraksinya Sang Jakal 
 Sedangkan untuk adaptasi film, novel ini pertama kali diadaptasi ke layar lebar oleh Universal Picture pada tahun 1973 dengan Edward Fox sebagai sang Jackal. Kabarnya plot filmnya ini sangat setia pada bukunya, sesuatu yang sangat jarang terjadi pada film-film yang diadaptasi dari sebuah novel. 
 Pada tahun 1997 film ini dibuat remake-nya dengan perubahan plot dan kondisi era tahun 90an dengan Bruce Willis sebagai sang Jackal didampingi Richard Gere dan Sidney Poiter.

Then, in the early nineteenth century, American missionaries arrive, bringing with them a new creed and a new way of life.

 ON April 1 and 2 I read James A. Michener's West Wind to Hawaii and loved it immensely. Actually, I read it in a volume of Reader's Digest Condensed Books whose editors have taken the liberty of describing the story of only the first generation of a Polynesian tribe that leaves the island of Bora Bora heading off for the North on a canoe named ""West Wind to Hawaii"" in search of Havaiki -- which probably became Hawaii with the passage of time. 
 James Michener and his wife, Mari, at home with their formidable art collection. 
 By the way, Hawaii for Mr Michener was just not a literary interest, it was also his home. He and his Japanese wife lived in a house given to them by a group of Hawaiians -- in the hope that he would write the story of their people. With his epic Hawaii he did exactly that, writing about the stories of five or six generations of the island's original settlers. Of course, he mixed it with spicy tit-bits of fiction. 
 ""The author did much through his writing, through his travels, and in his personal life to foster sympathetic understanding between the West and the people of the Orient."" 
 The beautiful Jocelyne LaGarde was a Tahitian who became famous for her one acting role in the 1966 motion picture, Hawaii. 
 Sixty Bora Bora islanders, including their King Tamatoa, his younger brother Teroro and their sister Natabu, set off on their perilous journey via sea with food, supplies and a house for their rock gods. Constellations help them in finding their way. Once they almost run out of food and water, so a storm with heavy rain helps them in quenching their thirst. Thus, they are provided a new life. 
 ""On the long voyage spirited Teroro put together the rough chant that would be remembered in the islands for generations after his death and which served to guide subsequent canoes from Tahiti to the new Havaiki: 
 Wait for the west wind, wait for the west wind! 
 Then sail to Nuku Hiva of the dark bays 
 To find the constant star. 
 Hold to it, hold to it 
 Till wild Ta'aroa sends the winds. 
 Then speed to the clouds where Pere waits. 
 Watch for her flames, the flames of Pere, 
 Till great Tane brings the land, 
 Brings Havaiki-of-the-North 
 Sleeping beneath the Little Eyes."" 
 Ta'aroa and Tane are the names of two rock gods while Pere is the name of a volcano rock goddess. Little Eyes is the name of a constellation of three stars which help in locating Havaiki.

 Tamatoa and Teroro's aunt Teura can predict the future with the help of omens. Mano, the great blue shark, also comes to her aid. She can converse with it and find the right course to their destination. 
 The islanders surely had some strange customs which with the coming of the missionaries a century or more later became taboo. ""The woman with whom the king lay was his sister. It had been believed since ancient times in the islands that for a king to breed an heir who would combine the finest lineage and utmost sanctity he must mate only with his full-blood sister; although both Tamatoa and Natabu might also take other spouses, their principal obligation was the production of royal descendants.""

 this is just a short little work, part of melville house's wonderful ""art of the novella"" series, but it is machado, so you know it is going to be wholly satisfying, despite being only 86 pages. 
 this one is about... madness. and how you don't want one person in charge of determining who is crazy and who is not. especially not this man: 
 In his fortieth year Bacamarte married the widow of a circuit judge. Her name was Dona Evarista da Costa e Mascarenhas, and she was neither beautiful nor charming. One of his uncles, an outspoken man, asked him why he had not selected a more attractive woman. The doctor replied that Dona Evarista enjoyed perfect digestion, excellent eyesight, and normal blood pressure; she had had no serious illnesses and her urinalysis was negative. It was likely she would give him healthy, robust children. If, in addition to her physiological accomplishments, Dona Evarista possessed a face composed of features neither individually pretty nor mutually compatible, he thanked God for it, for he would not be tempted to sacrifice his scientific pursuits for the contemplation of his wife's attractions. 
 because any man who is that clinical and impassive, that removed from ordinary human sentiment, is not the person i want telling me what sanity is. and by the end, you will be wishing he had just married a hotter wife. this is a man who needs distractions. 
 alas, instead of enjoying marital bliss with a fascinating woman, bacamarte instead sets out to single-mindedly diagnose the citizens of itaguai with their heretofore unrecognized mental disorders, and to open the first asylum in brazil. 
 he has a huge madhouse, and many rooms to fill. 
 and fill it he shall, using the ""i don't know what it is, but i know it when i see it"" argument. 
 machado wrote this in 1881, and the field of psychotherapy still had a ways to go, and i swear this man had some robert johnson thing going on, because his prescience, in all of his works, is so keen. he feels so damn modern, it thrills me. 
 in his hands, this becomes darkly absurd, and for a tiny little work, there are several reversals and more plot than you would expect, more plot than many authors could have delivered. 
 to be clear,this book is not about capital-e evil, it is not about taking advantage of position and influence. it is about misguidedness, pure and simple. so it is a more nuanced work than one that is just ""this man is abusing his power."" when you think of machado's contemporaries like dickens or wilkie collins, and how polarized their good/evil characters are, machado's psychological insights are even more impressive. thomas hardy was probably the only person writing at the same time who wrote emotional and moral ambiguity as well as machado. 
 and you know how i feel about him. 
 definitely read machado. i plan on doing some re-reading of him this year myself, and reading some of the ones i have not yet gotten to.",124.0,1,4752,33216.48,6.99,498,4,4,3

If his personal life might be lacking, he doesn't notice, especially whenever he steals a harmless glance or two at Riley Jameson's tight body.
When a universal flu shot is developed, it's hailed as a miracle, and rightly so. But the seemingly harmless side-effects begin to change the world, warping the statistics that Nick's always used to guide him through life.

176,The Longest Ride,Nicholas Sparks,2013,2013,"Ira Levinson is in trouble. At ninety-one years old, in poor health and alone in the world, he finds himself stranded on an isolated embankment after a car crash. Suffering multiple injuries, he struggles to retain consciousness until a blurry image materializes and comes into focus beside him: his beloved wife Ruth, who passed away nine years ago. Urging him to hang on, she forces him to remain alert by recounting the stories of their lifetime together - how they met, the precious paintings they collected together, the dark days of WWII and its effect on them and their families. Ira knows that Ruth can't possibly be in the car with him, but he clings to her words and his memories, reliving the sorrows and everyday joys that defined their marriage.
A few miles away, at a local rodeo, a Wake Forest College senior's life is about to change. Recovering from a recent break-up, Sophia Danko meets a young cowboy named Luke, who bears little resemblance to the privileged frat boys she has encountered at school. Through Luke, Sophia is introduced to a world in which the stakes of survival and success, ruin and reward -- even life and death - loom large in everyday life. As she and Luke fall in love, Sophia finds herself imagining a future far removed from her plans -- a future that Luke has the power to rewrite . . . if the secret he's keeping doesn't destroy it first.
Ira and Ruth. Sophia and Luke. Two couples who have little in common, and who are separated by years and experience. Yet their lives will converge with unexpected poignancy, reminding us all that even the most difficult decisions can yield extraordinary journeys: beyond despair, beyond death, to the farthest reaches of the human heart.",Fiction,Excellent,16,1,13,6.75,7,4.13,73144,4.0,"I don't recall ever associating the quality of being ''humane'' to a book before, but here I am doing just that for ''The Longest Ride.'' 
 The word came to my mind as I was reading the long and eloquent descriptions of many different emotions the characters are feeling in this powerful story. It didn't only feel as if the writer humanly described those emotions; it felt as if the book itself felt compassion for its ''actors.'' 
 But feel free to raise an eyebrow, because this is a little strange, I admit. Novels are not alive. Anyways. 
 Nicholas Sparks writes about love stories and strong, realistic issues in relationships, but I feel as if he really gave his everything in this one special book (which he says was one of his favourite stories to write). 
 There are many moments when I felt my stomach ache for Ira's dire situation and the seemingly uncertain and, at times, hopeless future of Sophia and Luke. Oh and that ending. I got shivers when I watched the movie, and I got shivers when I read the book. 
 Sparks' stories always have that peculiar fairy-tale-esque feel to them, though it's subtle enough not to become annoying. It's simply that he writes such romantic stories. He believes in true love and destiny and he clearly shows that through his novels. 
 Although he is such a beloved author, I never know for sure if I'm going to love his books before starting them. I disliked ''The Notebook,'' loved ''Dear John,'' thought ''The Lucky One'' was good but no more, found ''The Last Song'' wonderful and, finally ADORED ''The Longest Ride.'' See, I may like this author, but that doesn't guarantee my enjoyment of his works. 
 Very recommend. I also dare suggest the movie, despite the modifications made to the original story.

Leon Uris magnificently portrays the birth of a new nation in the midst of enemies--the beginning of an earthshaking struggle for power. Here is the tale that swept the world with its fury: the story of an American nurse, an Israeli freedom fighter caught up in a glorious, heartbreaking, triumphant era. Here is Exodus",Fiction,Excellent,78,1,14,4.243589743589744,14,4.33,148,5.0,"10 Stars, if I Could!!!! 
 Much to my chagrin I have never read Leon Uris! Why I waited? I have no excuses to serve up. Uris writes BIG BOOKS that are quite spectacular. He is one of very few brilliant maestros in literature, in my opinion. He writes with an ease that kept me turning the 648 pages of this great masterpiece. His research into the facts of Palestine and the exoduses to her holy land is extensive and as factual as possible in pre-electronic 1958. His characters are so well developed that I felt each one was a member of my very own family. I cried and laughed with them. I felt their dreams and their pain and the blinding frustration as they followed their life long dream: Palestine! And certainly the British Empire would be their greatest friend, especially since they ratified the Palestine Mandate, right? Wrong. Why? Oil, of course. As the novel begins, the reader is introduced to the British duplicity. Caught on the Cyprus shoreline in British DP camps behind barbed wire are thousands of Jewish refugees waiting for transport to Ersatz-Israel after the conclusion of WW II. Foreign correspondent Mark Palmer and his childhood friend Kitty Fremont are reunited and enjoying the Cyprus sun after the long war in Europe. Since her husband and child's death, Kitty has been on the Greek Island working as a nurse in various orphanages. 
 Ari Ben Canaan, a very handsome sabra asks Mark to stay and will hand him an exclusive. The Mossad agent is going to smuggle 300 children to Palestine right under the British noses! They are to sail on the Exodus in two weeks time. He also needs the services of Fremont, but she is adamant: no. Yes, you guessed it. She eventually does, but only after she meets a young girl named Karen in the camps and hears David Ben Ami's tale of a ""historical abortion."" This tale begins in 1896 Russia and ends with the Rabinsky brothers in Ersatz-Israel many long and difficult years later. 
 We also learn Karen and Dov's stories: the young Jewish girl who Ari squirreled out of Germany and into Denmark and the quiet bitter concentration camp survivor who is more at home in the dark dank sewers under a Polish Ghetto than in the light. We meet the sabras: Dagna, David, Eli, Jordana, and Ari. This first generation of Ersatz-Israel are strong and focused. They are Israel. They work hard without complaint to reclaim the ""dead"" land and will fight to their death to see Palestine as the independent state of Israel. Death threatens on all sides, neither the Arabs nor the Brits want them there. The ship Exodus is both a symbol and a life dream.

Who did kill Carolyn Polhemus?",Fiction,Excellent,3,1,15,3.840909090909091,5,4.1,92752,4.0,"This is one of the best books that I have read recently. It is a great legal thriller cum murder mystery. No wonder the book finds mention in both the top 100 mystery/crime novel lists published by the Britain-based Crime Writers' Association and by the Mystery Writers of America. Both the lists were published in the nineties and feature some of the finest specimens of crime writing. The lists can be found here - Link 
 The story is narrated by Rozat K. Sabich aka Rusty, chief deputy prosecutor of Kindle county who is also the protagonist. The story begins with the murder of Carolyn, another prosecuting attorney, with whom Rusty had an affair and never got over his obsession of her. Rusty gets the responsibility of investigating the crime but himself ends up getting accused of the murder and faces trial. 
 The book features some really great court room scenes, complex characters and portrays so many human emotions and frailties. Illicit passion, betrayal, corruption, dirty politics, jealousy, friendship, paternal feelings, family bonds - everything finds a place in the story. The author has also explained quite a few legal technicalities which makes it easier for the reader to understand some of the complexities of the trial. The mystery is excellent and the very few would be able to guess the identity of the culprit. 
 Rusty, accustomed to putting criminals behind bars, is now the accused and feels how is it to be on the other side. He talks about his obsession with Carolyn, his childhood, his strained relationship with his wife, his fear of missing out his son's childhood if he is sent to prison. Some of his ramblings is actually a bit boring and do not fit in the story.The author's use of the English language is impressive but somehow I felt at times it was not compatible with the character or the story. e.g. a person, who is a prosecutor not a poet, facing a murder charge is unlikely to use phrases like ""doors and windows of my soul are thrown open to a fundamental gratitude"". It is my only criticism of the novel. 
 The book is not just a thriller but Scott Turow's attempt to explore the intricacies of the human mind and he has done a commendable job. I would recommend the book to lovers of legal thrillers, murder mysteries, psychological thrillers if he/she does not mind the ramblings of the protagonist.",52.0,1,4995,14935.05,2.99,479,4,4,4

Historian Diana Bishop, descended from a line of powerful witches, and long-lived vampire Matthew Clairmont have broken the laws dividing creatures. When Diana discovered a significant alchemical manuscript in the Bodleian Library,she sparked a struggle in which she became bound to Matthew. Now the fragile coexistence of witches, daemons, vampires and humans is dangerously threatened.
Seeking safety, Diana and Matthew travel back in time to London, 1590. But they soon realise that the past may not provide a haven. Reclaiming his former identity as poet and spy for Queen Elizabeth, the vampire falls back in with a group of radicals known as the School of Night. Many are unruly daemons, the creative minds of the age, including playwright Christopher Marlowe and mathematician Thomas Harriot.
Together Matthew and Diana scour Tudor London for the elusive manuscript Ashmole 782, and search for the witch who will teach Diana how to control her remarkable powers...",Fiction,Excellent,8,1,15,9.375,13,4.05,321,2.0,"My rating: 2.5 of 5 stars 
 Shadow of Night picks up immediately after A Discovery of Witches ends (and I do mean immediately with little to no refresher. This was my second attempt at reading and I attribute my success at completing it solely because of this recap I found online which was an immense help.) with Matthew and Diana traveling back into the past to search for Ashmole 782 and to seek Diana help with her powers. For those that don't remember : Ashmole 782: the bewitched alchemical manuscript that Diana found in Oxford's Bodleian library. After the local witches, daemons, and vampires begin targeting Diana in order to find out how an unskilled witch was able to obtain the manuscript that they believe contains important information about the creation and future of all supernatural creatures. 
 Considering the fact that I loved A Discovery of Witches I was beyond ecstatic when I snagged an ARC copy of Shadow of Night. Diving into it right away in hopes to devour it whole I realized immediately that that's not how this was going to work. Positively rife with historical detail regarding the Elizabethan era and historical figures as well (Christopher Marlowe, Sir Walter Raleigh, John Dee, William Shakespeare and of course Queen Elizabeth I), this is one that will take some time to get through not just because of the amount of pages. The historical tidbits were interesting but I felt they lacked any sort of purpose and ultimately overpowered the true story making it much more dense and longer than it should have been. The name dropping, while interesting, caused a bit of an eye-roll for me because, did Matthew not have a single uncool friend that failed to make it into the history books? Apparently not. I can appreciate the obvious extent of the research the author conducted but including every interesting person from the time period felt a little like 'everything but the kitchen sink' and should have been scaled back a little to focus more on Matthew and Diana. 
 Shadow of Night definitely had a case of middle book syndrome. Add to that there's a real non-ending that will likely cause some grumbles. There was progress in the storyline but mostly things of little consequence. My favorite aspects by far were the slight glimpses of the present day and how Matthew and Diana's actions were inevitably changing the future. It was extremely interesting but those passages were so few and far between that I kept hoping for more. The evolution of Diana's powers was the most fascinating. Going back in time only resulted in throwing them into chaos and the slight control she did have over them dissipated but discovering the full extent of her powers was truly shocking. 
 Shadow of Night was definitely my least favorite of the trilogy so far but I'm looking forward to some resolution and seeing how everything turns out. I plan on picking up The Book of Life soon in case Harkness continues her non-recap trend.

 This time paeodophiles are being brutally murdered and no obvious reasoning is forthcoming. Kerrigan and the team are put onto the case and soon enough the bodies start piling up. About halfway through the book the storyline takes on a different turn sending the whole thing into a different direction. It was cleverly done and not an obvious route to follow. I enjoyed the book for the most part but did think some parts of the book were stretched out a little. Too much detail at times that wasn't really necessary and I would actually prefer shorter chapters to keep the flow and momentum going. Occasionally I would wonder into 'when is this chapter finishing?' territory as chapters would sometimes drag on. The second half of the book really picks up pace and this is where it really held my attention and I didn't want to put the book down until the end. 
 Maeve Kerrigan herself is a likeable character albeit her decisions at times leaves the head shaking. She isn't perfect my any means, quick tempered and could do with thinking before acting rationally but she has a flair for the job and is growing on me as her character develops through the books.

 So, I loved the Dark Tower series. It's one of the best works of fantasy I've read. If you haven't started it: 
 a) do so 
 b) don't read the spoilers here 
 The Dark Tower series is an incredibly varied set of books, written over the course of more than 30 years - written by a young man starting out on a wholly uncertain writing future - written by an old man looking back on a glittering career - and punctuated by all his experiences, discoveries, epiphanies. King brings all his talents to these pages ... and some of his weaknesses. You should read it, it is (forgive the pun) a towering work of imagination and characterization. 
 *** 
 This last volume is a curious mix for me, containing some great writing, an amazingly good idea for ending what must have been a very difficult tale to end well, and in some places some bewilderingly disappointing execution. This mix of brilliance and weakness has resulted in the 3* up top. 
 Below I venture into the deepest realms of spoiler-land, pontificating on the ending. Don't go there if you've not read the book, really. 
 Really! Don't spoil it for yourself 
 So. Randalf Flag, Susannah's baby, and most of all the Crimson King were all huge anticlimaxes for me. Given the nature of the ending and King's skill I wonder if these weren't perhaps intended to be anticlimaxes with everything turning out to be less impressive, less important, more shabby and spoiled than it had been built up to be in Roland's mind. In book 4/5 we see that anything can be magic, with Dodge gearsticks performing as magic wands. Perhaps here we see that anything can be your arch-nemesis and the undoing of the world - it's us (or Roland) who invests them with that power and at the end of it all he sees them for what they are? Who knows. Either way as a reader finding the Crimson King who has sat at the heart of this epic for decades, and finding him to be an unimpressive grenade-lobbing old man with no special powers, no wisdom or insights ... offering no closure ... well it didn't sit well. Perhaps this was intentional - to give me the same empty feeling Roland gets in the end, but it didn't quite work for this reader. I felt short-changed. 
 The idea for the close of the story, the coup de grace, is brilliant. But it could have been spelled out more clearly perhaps. A tough call since you don't want to over do it. 
 The end message (that I took at least) is that the journey was (and is for all of us) the important thing. Not the ending. And that if we set our sights on the end goal and sacrifice everything to get it, we will lose out on every level. Roland, who we admired for his unflinching commitment to the cause, for the doggedness with which he pursued the tower, is doomed to start at the beginning and repeat the hunt yet again for Ka is a wheel and he is bound to it. The strengths we saw in him, the willingness to sacrifice everything, even friends at the very end, are now shown as his weaknesses. His only chance to leave the wheel and find peace is to see this truth - that the important things are those he sacrifices time and again. His singularity of purpose is his curse, not his strength - the friendships and loves he encounters in the NOW are what matters, not the paper-thin Crimson King trapped in an empty tower. The path he plots toward the tower is the crucial thing - not if he gets there. 
 This is a beautiful, powerful way to conclude such an epic and I applaud King for his vision. I just wish he'd written it in a way that connected better with me when I read it.

 Collection of postmodern short stories from the 1960s and 1970s penned by that master of the genre, American author Donald Barthelme. Some short non-fiction satire is also included. Of course, I enjoyed a number of pieces more than others but one short zapper really hit home for me, most likely since I have been interested in art and aesthetics for a number of years. Reading Letters To The Editor I imagine myself sitting in a whaling boat watching lampoon-harpooner Daggoo-Barthelme hurling lampoon-harpoons at the whales of the art world. Ready, aim, let her soar, Daggoo-Donald! Here is a list of needle-sharp zingers from the hand on our intrepid harpooning author: 
 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
 The Controversy: Nicolai Pont, editor of Shock Art magazine admits a raw, tender nerve has been hit when his international art journal published an article on an exhibit by American artist Doug LeDuff featuring an original series of asterisks. Editor Pont announces Stock Art will accept only one more letter on the controversy before the subject is closed forever. Shock Art - love that name for the magazine and the mind-set of the people who run it, being shocked when an article they print about art actually shocks. 
 Art Theft: Bernardo Brown of Galerie Z accuses LaDuff of shamelessly copying the asterisks of Gianbello Bruno, a fellow Italian, an artist his Galerie Z represents. Bernardo points to a 1978 Paris exposition where artist Bruno incorporated a series of asterisks into his work. Sure, the American claims he has been painting asterisks since 1975 but, Bernando Brown asks: Where are these asterisks? Where is the proof? One of my favorite Barthelme lampoons here is the name of the American Artist Doug LeDuff. Doug is a common enough American name, but what about that LeDuff? Sounds like the artist or his agent committed some genuine art theft to conquer the European art market, combining the names of two famous, influential French artists - Le Corbusier and Jean Dubuffet. 
 Gallery Opening - Where art and party time come together 
 A Proud Heritage: Galerie Z is in Milan and Bernardo plays his trump card, since, after all, he is from the land that graced us with the Italian Renaissance and all those great Italian masters, the greatest artists the world has ever seen. ""Of course the fully American attitude of the partisans of LeDuff, that there is nothing except America, is evident here in the apparently fair evaluation of the protagonists which is in fact deeply biased in the direction of their native land."" Bernardo curtly dismisses the evidence LeDuff painted six pointed asterisks as opposed to the five pointed ones of Bruno; he also dismisses the fact that LeDuff predated Bruno in superimposing one asterisk on another. Bruno's tacit accusation: Americans are untalented, moneygrubbing bunglers, coarse hicks incapable of the barest shred of artistic originality, forever crudely copying and mimicking refined, highly accomplished European artists. (Of course, Bruno might be correct on this point, at least generally, but there is always that rare exception!) 
 Rome Chimes In: Pino Vitt smiles at the entire LeDufff-Galerie Z controversy asking: What do these bloody Americans really want after they come to Europe, are installed in the most sumptuous hotels yet still find reasons to complain about everything? Those childish, no talent Yanks made rich by our stupid bourgeois fly back home to figure out more ways to dupe and despoil our gullible bourgeois. ""Doug LeDuff is a pig and a child, but so are his enemies."" What is so great about this letter is Pino adds nothing to the subject at hand but rather takes the opportunity to slam the whole art scene - artist, supporters, detractors; if you are out there as part of the art scene, you're fodder for Pino's slam. Maybe Pino Vitt is still smarting from the humiliating loss Rome suffered at the hands of Milan in the latest soccer match. Or, perhaps, he envisions himself as a great Roman general put in the position of being required to put down the barbarians on Rome's borders. Or, perhaps Pino is an unrecognized artist producing paintings or sculptures or installations unacceptable to the art world. 
 Dusseldorf Chimes In: Hugo Timme points out to the faculty of the LeDuff-Galerie Z debate that LeDuff's art is so much bad wallpaper but Shock Art Magazine was irresponsible accepting for publication a Galerie Z ad defaming LeDuff. Hugo goes on to enlighten all by proclaiming that LeDuff and Bruno have both impersonated the accomplishments of the 1938 Magdeburg Handwerker. Ah, a German historian to the rescue. And love his referring to those contributors to the debate as ""faculty"" then skewering their ideas. 
 Artists Chime In: The members of an artist's group in Basel, Switzerland let it be known they are unfaltering supporters of the immense American master, Doug LeDuff. This is an international crowd with first names of Gianni, Michel, Zin and Erik. And it isn't an accident they are in Basel, the cradle of modern avant-garde art going back to the early years of the twentieth century.

Everyone tells him it's time to move on, to forget the past once and for all. But for David Beck, there can be no closure. A message has appeared on his computer, a phrase only he and his dead wife know. Suddenly Beck is taunted with the impossible- that somewhere, somehow, Elizabeth is alive.
Beck has been warned to tell no one. And he doesn't. Instead, he runs from the people he trusts the most, plunging headlong into a search for the shadowy figure whose messages hold out a desperate hope.

He has his choice of princesses. Unfortunately, his passion is for princes. Havyn has been a slave all his life. When his powers are discovered, he finds himself purchased and freed by a Prince and apprenticed to the royal wizard, Ildar. His duty is to stay chaste to keep his powers strong. Unfortunately, his passion is for Severin. With kingdoms at war, the throne hanging in the balance, and magic in the air, can the two men find happiness together, or is duty more important than love?",Fiction,Excellent,1,3,10,4.425,6,3.21,31,3.0,"The Chosen is a classic fantasy novel but without the epic length. Included are long journeys, prophesies, royalty, magic, oracles, wars at stake, forbidden love, runaway elopements, long lost princes, lengthy quests, true love, and a happy ending. Because the story stays pretty true to the fantasy origins, there is not originality offered but for those fans of the genre, the familiar themes are always welcome. The writing makes the story incredibly easy and fast to read so that kept my interest whereas if the pace had dragged I would have been bored. The characters are again right out of fantasy lore so nothing surprising but they are warm and likable. As a first novel, this is a decent fantasy offering that may be of interest to classic fantasy tales. 
 Severin is a prince out on a journey with his faithful wizard Ildar to find himself after a lifetime of being spoiled at his parent's whim. Severin buys Havyn at a slave auction, intending to free the man once they return to his home. Along the way, they discover Havyn has magical ability and Ildar quickly makes the ex-slave his new wizard's apprentice. Life isn't easy once they reach home though as Severin is set to wed the niece of a neighboring land, yet his chemistry with Havyn causes havoc for both. When the royal family and entourage set out for the betrothal ceremony, there is no end of problems. Murder, intrigue, runaways, long lost royalty, quests, true love, and a happy ending are all involved as the various characters find their way in this realm of magic and mystery. 
 There is a lot going on in this story but surprisingly, the plot never feels overwhelmed or too fast. Each issue brought up is well handled and builds upon the next so each piece is simply part of a bigger, more complicated whole. Some of the elements are pretty predictable and the story on the whole isn't wildly original. Often the plot feels obvious as the fantasy themes used are easy to identify so there is not a lot of suspense or wonder associated with reading. Yet the writing keeps the pace quick and characters interesting enough that even those who have read this type of story all the time will keep turning the page here. 
 Part of this is that the characters are pretty decent. Severin and Havyn narrate the story in alternating third person point of view and for the most part they stay well within the predictable roles. Havyn is slightly over the top with the orphan childhood sold into slavery from birth and never known a bath, clothing, food, or kindness. However this exaggeration is pretty typical of everyone in the book. All the characters seem to exist on the extremes of their description and supposedly almost all are virgins, which is necessary to fill their various roles. This is a bit of a stretch especially at the end when several of these mandates are flipped to provide a happy ending, but it didn't really bother me since it was clearly coming. 
 The various characters have a bit of charm, a bit of scheming, and some interest which kept me reading even though I knew what would happen - usually a sign I give up and become bored. Yet again, there's an ease to the writing that lets you enjoy the classic tale even if there is nothing surprising. The common themes are well loved for a reason and even though just about all used here, it pretty much works. This isn't a book that leaves you breathless but it is one you enjoy while reading. Or at least I mostly did.",7.0,1,4320,8596.8,1.99,1099,4,4,3

 This is truly great novel and it's written by one of the most respected scientist in the field about science of outer space, Carl Sagan. 
 Readers who enjoy techno-thrillers in the style of Michael Chrichton, I am sure that they will find this book the same as enjoyable. 
 Sagan is able to merge all his factual science knowledge with strong theories and very possible science fiction.

 THAT MESMERIZING DARK SPACE 
 For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love. 
 Sagan never compromised his credibility as a real scientist just to sell cheap action in this novel. 
 This is a smart tale with many hard science, but also it contains great characters with exceptional developing. 
 Since after all, only science can't tell a story, there must be people, and people has feelings, and you will perceive them. 
 He knows what he is doing and you get a very realistic aproach of how you could expect the human civilization can deal with the impact of knowing that we are not alone in the universe anymore. 
 If you are looking for flying saucers blasting lasers and the army fighting bravely against them, this is NOT your book. I have nothing against that approach, don't get me wrong. I like that kind of stories too. But, I think that it's fair to have once in a while a mature angle to craft a story about the first meeting with an alien intelligence. 
 You have here a very intelligent story with a strong scientific background.

189,North And South,John Jakes,1982,2012,"Written at the request of Charles Dickens, North and South is a book about rebellion; it poses fundamental questions about the nature of social authority and obedience. Gaskell expertly blends individual feeling with social concern, and her heroine, Margaret Hale, is one of the most original creations of Victorian literature.
When Margaret Hale's father leaves the Church in a crisis of conscience she is forced to leave her comfortable home in the tranquil countryside of Hampshire and move with her family to the fictional industrial town of Milton in the north of England. Though at first disgusted by her new surroundings, she witnesses the brutality wrought by the Industrial Revolution and becomes aware of the poverty and suffering of the local mill workers. Sympathetic to the poor she makes friends among them and develops a fervent sense of social justice. She clashes with the mill-owner and self-made man, John Thornton, who is contemptuous of his workers. However, their fierce opposition masks a deeper attraction.
Gaskell based her depiction of Milton on Manchester, where she lived as the wife of a Unitarian minister. She was an accomplished writer, much of her work published in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words including North and South which was originally published as a serial. She was also friends with Charlotte Bronte and after her death, her father, Patrick Bronte, chose Gaskell to write The Life of Charlotte Bronte.",Fiction,Excellent,33,1,14,5.545454545454546,8,4.13,826,4.0,It's Pride and Prejudice for Socialists.,455.0,1,58968,235282.32,3.99,653,5,4,2

From the internationally best-selling, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, a superbly crafted new work of fiction: eight stories--longer and more emotionally complex than any she has yet written--that take us from Cambridge and Seattle to India and Thailand as they enter the lives of sisters and brothers, fathers and mothers, daughters and sons, friends and lovers.
In the stunning title story, Ruma, a young mother in a new city, is visited by her father, who carefully tends the earth of her garden, where he and his grandson form a special bond. But he's harboring a secret from his daughter, a love affair he's keeping all to himself. In ""A Choice of Accommodations,"" a husband's attempt to turn an old friend's wedding into a romantic getaway weekend with his wife takes a dark, revealing turn as the party lasts deep into the night. In ""Only Goodness,"" a sister eager to give her younger brother the perfect childhood she never had is overwhelmed by guilt, anguish, and anger when his alcoholism threatens her family. And in ""Hema and Kaushik,"" a trio of linked stories--a luminous, intensely compelling elegy of life, death, love, and fate--we follow the lives of a girl and boy who, one winter, share a house in Massachusetts. They travel from innocence to experience on separate, sometimes painful paths, until destiny brings them together again years later in Rome.

 Lahiri's protagonists might all be Bengalis from India taking root in America and then often abroad, but their secrets, hopes and dreams are universal. The stories' endings are particularly powerful, full of surprises that never feel gimmicky. 
 Stylistically, these are old-fashioned stories; you can see and feel Lahiri's debt to writers like William Trevor and Mavis Gallant in her clear, concise, insightful prose. There's little experimentation with form, and there's a certain sameness to settings and backgrounds (New England or New York City, ivy league colleages). She's equally good getting into the skin of men or women, young or old. 
 Like priceless gems, though, these stories seem simple and lovely on the surface but are carefully cut, chosen and polished, hiding layers of mystery.",33.0,1,28296,112901.04,3.99,903,5,4,2

 he just never fails. 
 this is just a short little work, part of melville house's wonderful ""art of the novella"" series, but it is machado, so you know it is going to be wholly satisfying, despite being only 86 pages. 
 this one is about... madness. and how you don't want one person in charge of determining who is crazy and who is not. especially not this man: 
 In his fortieth year Bacamarte married the widow of a circuit judge. Her name was Dona Evarista da Costa e Mascarenhas, and she was neither beautiful nor charming. One of his uncles, an outspoken man, asked him why he had not selected a more attractive woman. The doctor replied that Dona Evarista enjoyed perfect digestion, excellent eyesight, and normal blood pressure; she had had no serious illnesses and her urinalysis was negative. It was likely she would give him healthy, robust children. If, in addition to her physiological accomplishments, Dona Evarista possessed a face composed of features neither individually pretty nor mutually compatible, he thanked God for it, for he would not be tempted to sacrifice his scientific pursuits for the contemplation of his wife's attractions. 
 because any man who is that clinical and impassive, that removed from ordinary human sentiment, is not the person i want telling me what sanity is. and by the end, you will be wishing he had just married a hotter wife. this is a man who needs distractions. 
 alas, instead of enjoying marital bliss with a fascinating woman, bacamarte instead sets out to single-mindedly diagnose the citizens of itaguai with their heretofore unrecognized mental disorders, and to open the first asylum in brazil. 
 he has a huge madhouse, and many rooms to fill. 
 and fill it he shall, using the ""i don't know what it is, but i know it when i see it"" argument. 
 machado wrote this in 1881, and the field of psychotherapy still had a ways to go, and i swear this man had some robert johnson thing going on, because his prescience, in all of his works, is so keen. he feels so damn modern, it thrills me. 
 in his hands, this becomes darkly absurd, and for a tiny little work, there are several reversals and more plot than you would expect, more plot than many authors could have delivered. 
 to be clear,this book is not about capital-e evil, it is not about taking advantage of position and influence. it is about misguidedness, pure and simple. so it is a more nuanced work than one that is just ""this man is abusing his power."" when you think of machado's contemporaries like dickens or wilkie collins, and how polarized their good/evil characters are, machado's psychological insights are even more impressive. thomas hardy was probably the only person writing at the same time who wrote emotional and moral ambiguity as well as machado. 
 and you know how i feel about him.

It is the secret history of three strangers from vastly different worlds--Dorothy, Vivien, and Jimmy--who meet by chance in wartime London and whose lives are forever entwined.

Then, in the early nineteenth century, American missionaries arrive, bringing with them a new creed and a new way of life.

 ON April 1 and 2 I read James A. Michener's West Wind to Hawaii and loved it immensely. Actually, I read it in a volume of Reader's Digest Condensed Books whose editors have taken the liberty of describing the story of only the first generation of a Polynesian tribe that leaves the island of Bora Bora heading off for the North on a canoe named ""West Wind to Hawaii"" in search of Havaiki -- which probably became Hawaii with the passage of time. 
 James Michener and his wife, Mari, at home with their formidable art collection. 
 By the way, Hawaii for Mr Michener was just not a literary interest, it was also his home. He and his Japanese wife lived in a house given to them by a group of Hawaiians -- in the hope that he would write the story of their people. With his epic Hawaii he did exactly that, writing about the stories of five or six generations of the island's original settlers. Of course, he mixed it with spicy tit-bits of fiction. 
 ""The author did much through his writing, through his travels, and in his personal life to foster sympathetic understanding between the West and the people of the Orient."" 
 The beautiful Jocelyne LaGarde was a Tahitian who became famous for her one acting role in the 1966 motion picture, Hawaii. 
 Sixty Bora Bora islanders, including their King Tamatoa, his younger brother Teroro and their sister Natabu, set off on their perilous journey via sea with food, supplies and a house for their rock gods. Constellations help them in finding their way. Once they almost run out of food and water, so a storm with heavy rain helps them in quenching their thirst. Thus, they are provided a new life. 
 ""On the long voyage spirited Teroro put together the rough chant that would be remembered in the islands for generations after his death and which served to guide subsequent canoes from Tahiti to the new Havaiki: 
 Wait for the west wind, wait for the west wind! 
 Then sail to Nuku Hiva of the dark bays 
 To find the constant star. 
 Hold to it, hold to it 
 Till wild Ta'aroa sends the winds. 
 Then speed to the clouds where Pere waits. 
 Watch for her flames, the flames of Pere, 
 Till great Tane brings the land, 
 Brings Havaiki-of-the-North 
 Sleeping beneath the Little Eyes."" 
 Ta'aroa and Tane are the names of two rock gods while Pere is the name of a volcano rock goddess. Little Eyes is the name of a constellation of three stars which help in locating Havaiki.

 Tamatoa and Teroro's aunt Teura can predict the future with the help of omens. Mano, the great blue shark, also comes to her aid. She can converse with it and find the right course to their destination. 
 The islanders surely had some strange customs which with the coming of the missionaries a century or more later became taboo. ""The woman with whom the king lay was his sister. It had been believed since ancient times in the islands that for a king to breed an heir who would combine the finest lineage and utmost sanctity he must mate only with his full-blood sister; although both Tamatoa and Natabu might also take other spouses, their principal obligation was the production of royal descendants.""

194,The Orphan Master’S Son,Adam Johnson,2012,2012,"19 hrs 22 min
An epic novel and a thrilling literary discovery, The Orphan Master's Son follows a young man's journey through the icy waters, dark tunnels, and eerie spy chambers of the world's most mysterious dictatorship, North Korea.
Pak Jun Do is the haunted son of a lost mother--a singer ""stolen"" to Pyongyang--and an influential father who runs Long Tomorrows, a work camp for orphans. There the boy is given his first taste of power, picking which orphans eat first and which will be lent out for manual labor. Recognized for his loyalty and keen instincts, Jun Do comes to the attention of superiors in the state, rises in the ranks, and starts on a road from which there will be no return.
Considering himself ""a humble citizen of the greatest nation in the world,"" Jun Do becomes a professional kidnapper who must navigate the shifting rules, arbitrary violence, and baffling demands of his Korean overlords in order to stay alive. Driven to the absolute limit of what any human being could endure, he boldly takes on the treacherous role of rival to Kim Jong Il in an attempt to save the woman he loves, Sun Moon, a legendary actress ""so pure, she didn't know what starving people looked like.""
Part breathless thriller, part story of innocence lost, part story of romantic love, The Orphan Master's Son is also a riveting portrait of a world heretofore hidden from view: a North Korea rife with hunger, corruption, and casual cruelty but also camaraderie, stolen moments of beauty, and love. A towering literary achievement, The Orphan Master's Son ushers Adam Johnson into the small group of today's greatest writers.

 Yeah, 2013 was supposed to be the year of Dennis Lehane for me. It probably would have been had I not discovered George Pelecanos. However, I'm back aboard the Lehane Train now and quite pleased. 
 While Mystic River is normally classified as a thriller, it's so much more than that, an exploration of growing up and what a traumatic childhood event can blossom into. Mystic River is the tale of three Boston boys who grew up to be very different Boston men. Dave Boyle has drifted from job to job, never quite managing to bury his abduction experience. Jimmy Marcus is a former career criminal who has gone straight and become a family man. And Sean Devine is a cop with a wife he hasn't seen in over a year and a child he's not sure is his. 
 From the beginning, Lehane kept the waters sufficiently muddy to hold my interest. While I knew I was supposed to assume Dave Boyle killed Katie Marcus, Lehane had me changing my opinion quite a few times. None of the three leads are very simple characters. Dave's got his childhood baggage but still tries to be the best husband and father he can be. Jimmy was once a criminal and is still a hard man but is a loving family man. Sean is a supercop but his marriage is in ruins and he's coming off a suspension for something very petty. 
 Once Sean is on the case, the book becomes very hard to put down, like it's been duct-taped to your hands. The mystery, unlike a lot of them these days, is solvable and I guessed who the killer was about 75% of the way through, even though I got the motive wrong. 
 The writing is everything I came to expect from the Kenzie and Gennaro series and then some. I think this is the book where Dennis Lehane went from ""Good Thriller Writer"" to simply ""Great Writer."" 
 Five stars. I suppose I'll track down the movie now.",94.0,1,43848,394193.52,8.99,739,5,1,3
196,The Day Of The Jackal,Frederick Forsyth,1971,2011,"Copy-editor: 
Seorang pria Inggris yang hanya dikenal dengan nama sandi: Jakal, disewa oleh organisasi pemberontak Prancis untuk membunuh Presiden Charles de Gaulle. Sebelumnya, upaya-upaya pembunuhan terhadap sang presiden selalu gagal. Informasi dan perencanaannya bocor ke tangan pemerintah lewat agen-agen yang disusupkan ke dalam organisasi rahasia tersebut.
Namun, kali ini serangan sang Jakal akan benar-benar rahasia dan mematikan!
Tidak ada satu pun arsip dan data yang dimiliki oleh pihak keamanan Prancis dan bahkan dinas rahasia di seluruh dunia terhadap pembunuh bayaran profesional top dunia ini. Tidak diketahui kapan, di mana, dan bagaimana sang Jakal akan beraksi. Perburuan pun dilakukan. Semua sumber daya keamanan dan informasi dikerahkan hanya untuk memburu satu orang yang tak bernama dan tak jelas pula ciri-ciri fisiknya. Namun yang pasti, nyawa sang presiden menjadi taruhannya dan Komisaris Claude Lebel, detektif terbaik Prancis, harus berpacu dengan waktu untuk meringkusnya.
Novel thriller terbaik di kelasnya ini telah mengilhami banyak peristiwa serupa di berbagai belahan dunia. Diceritakan dengan mendetail, seru, dan menegangkan, membuat Anda enggan meletakkannya sebelum membacanya sampai halaman terakhir.",Fiction,Excellent,36,1,8,2.9722222222222223,14,4.25,57,4.0,"Tentunya kita masih ingat sekitar dua tahun yang lalu Presiden SBY dalam sebuah konferensi pers mengatakan bahwa foto dirinya dijadikan sasaran tembak oleh para teroris yang sedang berlatih. Sebenarnya ini bukanlah hal yang aneh karena para pemimpin negara di berbagai belahan dunia ini seringkali menjadi target utama pembunuhan dari para lawan politiknya. 
 Presiden Soekarno sendiri selama masa pemerintahannya telah tujuh kali mengalami percobaan pembunuhan, begitu juga dengan pemimpin-pemimpin negara lainnya, rekor terbanyak hingga kini dipegang oleh pemimpin Cuba, Fidel Castro dengan 638 kali usaha percobaan pembunuhan terhadapnya. 
 Dari sekian banyak pemimpin dunia yang mendapat ancaman pembunuhan, Charles de Gaulle, (Presiden Perancis 1958-1969) adalah salah satu Presiden yang berkali-kali lolos dari upaya pembunuhan terhdap dirinya. Yang paling terkenal adalah yang terjadi pada tgl 22 Agustus 1962 dimana ia dan istrinya ditembak ketika sedang mengendarai mobil. Rencana pembunuhan ini dikomandoi oleh Kolonel Jean-Marie-Thiry, anggota militer Prancis sekaligus pemimpin OAS (Organisation L'armee Secrete), organisasi tentara rahasia yang berniat bertujuan menjatuhkan de Gaulle karena mereka berpendapat sang Presiden telah menghianati negaranya dengan memberi kemerdekaan kepada Aljazair yang semula merupakan tanah jajahan Prancis. 
 Rencana tersebut gagal, walau terdapat 14 lubang tembakan di mobilnya, Charles de Gaulle dan istrinya selamat dan Kolonel Thiry diganjar hukuman mati oleh pengadilan miltier Prancis pada tahun 1963. Persitiwa inilah yang kemudian mengilhami novelis Inggris Frederick Forsyth untuk menulis novel The Day of The Jackal (1971) 
 Dalam novelnya ini Forsyth mengawali kisahnya saat menjelang dilaksanakannya hukuman mati bagi Kolonel Jean-Marie-Thiry. Kemudian kisah bergerak mundur sejenak ke peristiwa percobaan pembunuhan de Gaulle yang dikomandoi oleh Kolonel Thiry. Paska percobaan pembunuhan yang gagal inilah yang oleh Forsyth dijadikan pijakan awal dalam mengembangkan imajinasinya. 
 Kematian Kolonel Thiry selaku pimpinan OAS tak membuat putus asa anggota-anggotanya. Belajar dari kegagalan-kegagalan sebelumnya, Kolonel Rodin, salah satu petinggi OAS membuat sebuah rencana rahasia untuk mencoba kembali membunuh Presiden de Gaulle melalui jasa seorang pembunuh profesional. Untuk mencegah bocornya rencana ini maka hanya tiga petinggi OAS dan sang pembunuh bayaran yang mengetahuinya. 
 Seluruh rencana pembunuhan diserahkan pada si pembunuh bayaran dari Inggris dengan nama sandi ""Jackal"". OAS hanya menyediakan bayaran yang diminta oleh si jackal yaitu 500 ribu dolar ( Rp. 4,5 Milyar), jumlah yang fantastis di tahun 60an. Setelah menerima uang muka dari OAS, mulailah sang Jackal melakukan berbagai persiapan mulai dari memesan senjata khusus dengan peluru berhulu ledak yang jika mengenai kepala akan menghancurkan segalanya di dalam tulang tengkorak, membuat 4 buah paspor palsu, hingga mempersiapkan perlengkapan penyamaran secara matang. 
 Berkat kejelian kepolisian Prancis, rencana pembunuhan terhadap Presiden de Gaulle kembali tercium, hanya saja kali ini mereka dibuat hampir mati kutu karena yang mereka ketahui hanyalah ciri-ciri fisik si pembunuh yaitu pria Inggris jangkung dengan rambut pirang, selain itu tak ada satu arsip dan data yang dimiliki pihak keamanan Prancis mengenai nama pembunuh, kapan, dimana, dan bagaimana si pembunuh professional ini akan beraksi. 
 Dengan nyawa Presiden sebagai taruhannya, pihak kepolisian Prancis yang dipimpin oleh Claude Lebel, detektif terbaik Prancis dan dibantu oleh kepolisian dari lima negara Eropa plus Amerika dan Afrika bertarung dengan waktu dan kecerdasan si Jackal dalam melaksanakannya tugas yang diembannya. 
 Kaya akan detail 
 Yang membuat novel ini menarik adalah bagaimana Forsyth menghadirkan detail-detail fakta dan peristiwanya. Hal ini bisa jadi keunggulan sekaligus kelemahan dimata pembacanya. Bagi yang menyukai kisah dengan plot cepat hal ini bisa jadi membosankan, terlebih jika pembaca tidak begitu menguasai materi yang dipaparkan si penulis. 
 Contohnya adalah soal senjata rakitan yang dipakai oleh si Jackal. Di sini penulis memaparkan secara detail mulai dari ukuran, jenis logam, alat picu, dsb yang tentunya membuat pembaca yang awam akan senjata jadi bosan, namun bagi mereka yang akrab dengan senjata mungkin hal ini merupakan bagian yang menarik. 
 Selain soal senjata, detail-detail soal pencurian paspor, pembuatan SIM Internasional dan paspor palsu, penyamaran si jackal, bagaimana ia mengelabui petugas keamanan dan imigrasi , cara kerja seorang detektif dalam merangkai data, dan sebagainya juga dibeberkan dalam novel ini. Selain itu penulis juga memaparkan latar belakang politik Prancis di masa pemerintahan Charles de Gaulle yang tentunya akan menambah wawasan pembacanya dalam hal situasi politik Prancis di tahun 60-an. 
 Kesemua itu diramu oleh Forsyth menjadi sebuah kisah triller yang menarik, walau di awal-awal agak terasa membosankan karena detail-detail diatas namun di bag-bab terakhir pembaca akan dibawa pada puncak ketegangan ketika Sang Presiden telah berada dalam bidikan senjata sang Jackal. 
 Di novel ini juga dikisahkan bagaimana Union Corse sebuah sindikat kejahatan yang terorganisir di Prancis yang lebih tua dan berbahaya daripada Mafia Sisilia turut membantu kepolisian Prancis untuk memburu sang Jackal. Sayangnya Forsyth kurang mengeksplorasi keterlibatan Union Corse, kalau saja peran organisasi rahasia ini diberi porsi yang lebih besar novel ini pasti akan lebih menarik lagi. 
 Novel yang berbahaya 
 Saking detailnya penulis memberikan gambaran bagaima sang Jackal mempersiapkan dirinya untuk melaksanakan perkerjaan profersionalnya, buku ini ternyata memberikan dampak yang mungkin tidak terduga oleh Forsyth sebelumnya. 
 Metode untuk mendapatkan paspor palsu yang secara diteil dijelaskan dalam buku ini berhasil ditiru oleh banyak orang. Metode yang akhirnya dikenal dengan istilah ""Day of the Jackal Fraud"" ini kemudian dianggap sebagai celah keamanan paling rentan di Inggris sehingga pemerintah Inggris akhirnya melakukan perubahan besar-besaran dalam birokrasi pengurusan dokumen. 
 Usaha sang Jackal untuk membunuh presiden Prancis juga mengilhami Yigal Amir, seorang militan ekstrem kanan untuk membunuh PM Israel Yithzak Rabin pada 1955. Vladimir Arutnunian yang pada tahun 2005 berencana membunuh Presiden AS George W. Bush mengaku terobsesi untuk melakukan apa yang dilakukan oleh Jackal. 
 Dari fakta-fakta diatas rasanya tak berlebihan kalau novel ini saya anggap sebagai novel yang memikat sekaligus berbahaya! 
 Sejarah Penerbitan dan Adaptasi film 
 The Day of The Jackal karya Frederick Forsyth ini pertama kali diterbitkan di Inggris pada 1971 oleh penerbit Huthcinson dan langsung menjadi best seller.

 Sedangkan untuk adaptasi film, novel ini pertama kali diadaptasi ke layar lebar oleh Universal Picture pada tahun 1973 dengan Edward Fox sebagai sang Jackal. Kabarnya plot filmnya ini sangat setia pada bukunya, sesuatu yang sangat jarang terjadi pada film-film yang diadaptasi dari sebuah novel. 
 Pada tahun 1997 film ini dibuat remake-nya dengan perubahan plot dan kondisi era tahun 90an dengan Bruce Willis sebagai sang Jackal didampingi Richard Gere dan Sidney Poiter.

Fighting for their lives, scattered survivors find the attempted cure to be almost worse than the disease. In the twilight of a shattered civilization, the fate of humankind rests upon the actions of a handful of war-weary survivors. Driven to a scorched corner of the former United States, they alone hold the key to a global reawakening. Or the final epitaph for a dead planet.",Fiction,Excellent,11,8,16,12.363636363636363,8,3.45,264,3.0,"Fire was a quick read for me. Set in the Southern US on the eve of the zombie apocalypse, Fire follows a large cast of characters through the initial stages of a zombie causing contagion to the aftermath. 
 I'm always amused by the amount of ammunition available to survivors of zombie apocalypses. There always seems to be a never ending supply of ammo. 
 I liked that the author had a diverse cast of characters, from all walks of life. No one was safe from becoming zombie fodder, either. It amazes me which type of character rises to the top of the heap in these types of novels, too. 
 I enjoyed the story, although I had a little difficulty understanding the origin of the zombie contagion. All of a sudden, people were getting ill and then becoming violent. They then bit another person who reanimated as a zombie. But - where did it come from? Why? 
 Also - using nuclear weapons to get rid of zombies? That's a new one. So now I need to add a few other things to my zombie survival kit - an old car without any electronics, able to outlast an electro-magnetic pulse. 
 All in all, a fun, if not gory, read. Recommended for zombie apocalypse lovers.

198,The Gathering Storm,Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson,2009,2015,"Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, looms. And mankind is not ready.
The final volume of the Wheel of Time, ""A Memory of Light, "" was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson, ""New York Times"" bestselling author of the Mistborn books, was chosen by Jordan's editor--his wife, Harriet McDougal--to complete the final book. The scope and size of the volume was such that it could not be contained in a single book, and so Tor proudly presents ""The Gathering Storm"" as the first of three novels that will cover the outline left by Robert Jordan, chronicling Tarmon Gai'don and Rand al'Thor's final confrontation with the Dark One. This short sequence will complete the struggle against the Shadow, bringing to a close a journey begun almost twenty years ago and marking the conclusion of the Wheel of Time, the preeminent fantasy epic of our era.
In this epic novel, Robert Jordan's international bestselling series begins its dramatic conclusion. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward--wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders--his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.
Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower--and possibly the world itself.
The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.",Fiction,Excellent,8,1,15,9.375,5,4.35,40,5.0,"'The Gathering Storm' is book 12 in 'The Wheel of Time' series, but it is the first book in the 'The Final Battle' trilogy, the last three books in the series. Incidentally, these final three books are written by Brandon Sanderson and not by Robert Jordan, who has passed away. I did not notice much difference in style (with the exception that the women do less folding of arms and pouting). The important thing is Jordan had notes and spoke about how he wanted the series to end, so Sanderson had an idea of what shape the Grand Finale would take. 
 And WOW! 'The Gathering Storm' was amazing! Egwene and Rand learn hard lessons about leadership in fighting their wars, while Perrin and Mat are reluctantly being drawn by their ta'veren connection to Rand into joining him at last (they haven't been in the same place for ten books). Perrin and Mat like to keep as far from Rand as he allows, but that is ending in 'The Gathering Storm'. (cue ominous music) Rand's outrage and continuing dark emo at being selected as the Dragon Reborn rings authentic to me (he wanted a normal life as a sheepherder and farmer, a life from which he has been ripped away, and instead he has been pushed into a world of blood, violence and unwanted sacrifice) but the sudden conversion by embracing Love in his Judean mountain moment - third temptation - did not. After I picked myself up from the floor after the condition prolonged helpless laughter left me, I decided this one scene was not going to deter me from enjoying the series. It is a Fantasy, after all. 
 Note: there is NO WAY to enjoy these books or understand what is going on without beginning with Book 1, The Eye of the World. 
 p.s. if you have any spanking perversions OR aversions, this series will be interesting for you on some, perhaps previously unknown, levels. I am finding the subject vaguely more interesting myself as I go along.",3.0,1,5076,20253.24,3.99,473,4,2,2
199,Cannery Row,John Steinbeck,1945,2002,"Cannery Rowis a book without much of a plot. Rather, it is an attempt to capture the feeling and people of a place, the cannery district of Monterey, California, which is populated by a mix of those down on their luck and those who choose for other reasons not to live ""up the hill"" in the more respectable area of town. The flow of the main plot is frequently interrupted by short vignettes that introduce us to various denizens of the Row, most of whom are not directly connected with the central story. These vignettes are often characterized by direct or indirect reference to extreme violence: suicides, corpses, and the cruelty of the natural world.
The ""story"" of Cannery Rowfollows the adventures of Mack and the boys, a group of unemployed yet resourceful men who inhabit a converted fish-meal shack on the edge of a vacant lot down on the Row.
Sweet Thursday is the sequel to Cannery Row.",Fiction,Excellent,8,3,5,3.75,5,4.02,83404,4.0,"Man, I love Steinbeck. I love the simplicity of his characters and the humdrum feeling their lives evoke. I love the indigence of his settings and the candidness with which these characters accept their conditions. I love how quietly he frames his stories with comments on fatalism, while still revealing to us the potential for happiness that pushes at its surface, trying to elbow its way out. At its core, the Steinbeck novel want us to figure out how to embrace the cards life has dealt us. It knows that the sooner we do, the sooner that happiness can become ours for the taking. It might be a fatalistic coin we're being asked to pocket, but it's a coin on which has been embossed a seal of optimism. 
 But he certainly doesn't make it very easy. The characters in his books are so far down the economic ladder you need a pair of binoculars to find them. And when you do spot them, you discover they are haggling over nickels and frogs. You almost want to step in and give them a Lowe's gift card, just to make things a little easier for them. But Steinbeck characters don't need your damn Lowe's gift card. The point is not to move up that ladder; it's to find comfort with the rung you're already on. If they can recognize that, why can't you? 
 And that's the thing about Steinbeckian characters: they often possess a deeper level of knowledge and understanding than their financial statuses--or their grammar--would otherwise suggest. There are also usually one or two who stand out from the rest for their capacity to grasp and relay human need. Where Ma Joad was just such a character in The Grapes of Wrath, it is Doc who lays it to us straight in Cannery Row. 
 ""The things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second."" 
 Ruminating on the contradictory nature of being human, wherein one's needs are in direct competition with one's moral goals, Doc reminds us what's worth appreciating about Mack and his Flophouse friends. Sure, they manipulate a situation for an advantageous edge if they can, and sure their idea of a party would make Clarissa Dalloway scream in mortified horror, but when all is said and done, they are honest with their friends and true to themselves in their dealings, and that is what makes their lives--at least that part of it--worth emulating. 
 So keep your Lowe's gift cards. They are not wanted here.",186.0,1,47088,424262.88,9.01,713,5,4,2
200,Guilty Pleasures,Lawrence Sanders,1998,1976,,Fiction,Excellent,5,10,16,12.4,2,4.03,79,5.0,"Ticket for a Gallery Exhibition - cherished prize in the art world 
 Collection of postmodern short stories from the 1960s and 1970s penned by that master of the genre, American author Donald Barthelme. Some short non-fiction satire is also included. Of course, I enjoyed a number of pieces more than others but one short zapper really hit home for me, most likely since I have been interested in art and aesthetics for a number of years. Reading Letters To The Editor I imagine myself sitting in a whaling boat watching lampoon-harpooner Daggoo-Barthelme hurling lampoon-harpoons at the whales of the art world. Ready, aim, let her soar, Daggoo-Donald! Here is a list of needle-sharp zingers from the hand on our intrepid harpooning author: 
 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
 The Controversy: Nicolai Pont, editor of Shock Art magazine admits a raw, tender nerve has been hit when his international art journal published an article on an exhibit by American artist Doug LeDuff featuring an original series of asterisks. Editor Pont announces Stock Art will accept only one more letter on the controversy before the subject is closed forever. Shock Art - love that name for the magazine and the mind-set of the people who run it, being shocked when an article they print about art actually shocks. 
 Art Theft: Bernardo Brown of Galerie Z accuses LaDuff of shamelessly copying the asterisks of Gianbello Bruno, a fellow Italian, an artist his Galerie Z represents. Bernardo points to a 1978 Paris exposition where artist Bruno incorporated a series of asterisks into his work. Sure, the American claims he has been painting asterisks since 1975 but, Bernando Brown asks: Where are these asterisks? Where is the proof? One of my favorite Barthelme lampoons here is the name of the American Artist Doug LeDuff. Doug is a common enough American name, but what about that LeDuff? Sounds like the artist or his agent committed some genuine art theft to conquer the European art market, combining the names of two famous, influential French artists - Le Corbusier and Jean Dubuffet. 
 Gallery Opening - Where art and party time come together 
 A Proud Heritage: Galerie Z is in Milan and Bernardo plays his trump card, since, after all, he is from the land that graced us with the Italian Renaissance and all those great Italian masters, the greatest artists the world has ever seen. ""Of course the fully American attitude of the partisans of LeDuff, that there is nothing except America, is evident here in the apparently fair evaluation of the protagonists which is in fact deeply biased in the direction of their native land."" Bernardo curtly dismisses the evidence LeDuff painted six pointed asterisks as opposed to the five pointed ones of Bruno; he also dismisses the fact that LeDuff predated Bruno in superimposing one asterisk on another. Bruno's tacit accusation: Americans are untalented, moneygrubbing bunglers, coarse hicks incapable of the barest shred of artistic originality, forever crudely copying and mimicking refined, highly accomplished European artists. (Of course, Bruno might be correct on this point, at least generally, but there is always that rare exception!) 
 Rome Chimes In: Pino Vitt smiles at the entire LeDufff-Galerie Z controversy asking: What do these bloody Americans really want after they come to Europe, are installed in the most sumptuous hotels yet still find reasons to complain about everything? Those childish, no talent Yanks made rich by our stupid bourgeois fly back home to figure out more ways to dupe and despoil our gullible bourgeois. ""Doug LeDuff is a pig and a child, but so are his enemies."" What is so great about this letter is Pino adds nothing to the subject at hand but rather takes the opportunity to slam the whole art scene - artist, supporters, detractors; if you are out there as part of the art scene, you're fodder for Pino's slam. Maybe Pino Vitt is still smarting from the humiliating loss Rome suffered at the hands of Milan in the latest soccer match. Or, perhaps, he envisions himself as a great Roman general put in the position of being required to put down the barbarians on Rome's borders. Or, perhaps Pino is an unrecognized artist producing paintings or sculptures or installations unacceptable to the art world. 
 Dusseldorf Chimes In: Hugo Timme points out to the faculty of the LeDuff-Galerie Z debate that LeDuff's art is so much bad wallpaper but Shock Art Magazine was irresponsible accepting for publication a Galerie Z ad defaming LeDuff. Hugo goes on to enlighten all by proclaiming that LeDuff and Bruno have both impersonated the accomplishments of the 1938 Magdeburg Handwerker. Ah, a German historian to the rescue. And love his referring to those contributors to the debate as ""faculty"" then skewering their ideas. 
 Artists Chime In: The members of an artist's group in Basel, Switzerland let it be known they are unfaltering supporters of the immense American master, Doug LeDuff. This is an international crowd with first names of Gianni, Michel, Zin and Erik. And it isn't an accident they are in Basel, the cradle of modern avant-garde art going back to the early years of the twentieth century. And, of course, having their names listed one under another, manifesto-like, adds weight to their support. 
 Photo of a group of artists - could be 1966 or 2016. Some things never change. 
 Rotteerdam Chimes In: Madga Baum is outraged that the galleries, critics and collectors bickering in this LeBuff debate have ignored the artist Elaine Grasso, who has been working in the field of parentheses. Oh, those damn men and the male dominated art world overlooking a real artist just because she's a woman! 
 Athens Chimes in: G. Philios lets everyone know their debate is complexly misguided since the asterisk is from the Greek asteriskos (or small star) and has served a very specific function going all the way back to Greek mythology. G. Philios ends by making a specific plea to the editors to publish his letter so people will know he set the record straight. 
 An Art Critic Chimes In: Yes, Shock Art Magazine consulted Titus Toselli Dolla in Palermo, a highly respected art critic, to contribute a letter on the subject. As part of his letter, Titus denounces LeDuff, ""The brutality of the American rape of the world's exhibition spaces and organs of art-information has distanciated his senses."" Love Titus and his slicing comment about Americans immediately following his claim of maintaining a critical distance from all passions surrounding the debate. And true to form, Titus peppers his writing with words like ""distanciated."" Very much in keeping with art criticism - vocabulary as a weapon to keep the uninitiated outsider out.",93.0,1,3996,11948.04,2.99,622,3,1,3
201,Shadow Of Night,Deborah Harkness,2012,2012,"IT BEGAN WITH A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES.
Historian Diana Bishop, descended from a line of powerful witches, and long-lived vampire Matthew Clairmont have broken the laws dividing creatures. When Diana discovered a significant alchemical manuscript in the Bodleian Library,she sparked a struggle in which she became bound to Matthew. Now the fragile coexistence of witches, daemons, vampires and humans is dangerously threatened.
Seeking safety, Diana and Matthew travel back in time to London, 1590. But they soon realise that the past may not provide a haven. Reclaiming his former identity as poet and spy for Queen Elizabeth, the vampire falls back in with a group of radicals known as the School of Night. Many are unruly daemons, the creative minds of the age, including playwright Christopher Marlowe and mathematician Thomas Harriot.
Together Matthew and Diana scour Tudor London for the elusive manuscript Ashmole 782, and search for the witch who will teach Diana how to control her remarkable powers...",Fiction,Excellent,8,1,15,9.375,13,4.05,321,2.0,"My rating: 2.5 of 5 stars 
 Shadow of Night picks up immediately after A Discovery of Witches ends (and I do mean immediately with little to no refresher. This was my second attempt at reading and I attribute my success at completing it solely because of this recap I found online which was an immense help.) with Matthew and Diana traveling back into the past to search for Ashmole 782 and to seek Diana help with her powers. For those that don't remember : Ashmole 782: the bewitched alchemical manuscript that Diana found in Oxford's Bodleian library. After the local witches, daemons, and vampires begin targeting Diana in order to find out how an unskilled witch was able to obtain the manuscript that they believe contains important information about the creation and future of all supernatural creatures. 
 Considering the fact that I loved A Discovery of Witches I was beyond ecstatic when I snagged an ARC copy of Shadow of Night. Diving into it right away in hopes to devour it whole I realized immediately that that's not how this was going to work. Positively rife with historical detail regarding the Elizabethan era and historical figures as well (Christopher Marlowe, Sir Walter Raleigh, John Dee, William Shakespeare and of course Queen Elizabeth I), this is one that will take some time to get through not just because of the amount of pages. The historical tidbits were interesting but I felt they lacked any sort of purpose and ultimately overpowered the true story making it much more dense and longer than it should have been. The name dropping, while interesting, caused a bit of an eye-roll for me because, did Matthew not have a single uncool friend that failed to make it into the history books? Apparently not. I can appreciate the obvious extent of the research the author conducted but including every interesting person from the time period felt a little like 'everything but the kitchen sink' and should have been scaled back a little to focus more on Matthew and Diana. 
 Shadow of Night definitely had a case of middle book syndrome. Add to that there's a real non-ending that will likely cause some grumbles. There was progress in the storyline but mostly things of little consequence. My favorite aspects by far were the slight glimpses of the present day and how Matthew and Diana's actions were inevitably changing the future. It was extremely interesting but those passages were so few and far between that I kept hoping for more. The evolution of Diana's powers was the most fascinating. Going back in time only resulted in throwing them into chaos and the slight control she did have over them dissipated but discovering the full extent of her powers was truly shocking. 
 Shadow of Night was definitely my least favorite of the trilogy so far but I'm looking forward to some resolution and seeing how everything turns out. I plan on picking up The Book of Life soon in case Harkness continues her non-recap trend.

202,Exodus,Leon Uris,1958,1958,"Exodusis an international publishing phenomenon--the towering novel of the twentieth century's most dramatic geopolitical event.
Leon Uris magnificently portrays the birth of a new nation in the midst of enemies--the beginning of an earthshaking struggle for power. Here is the tale that swept the world with its fury: the story of an American nurse, an Israeli freedom fighter caught up in a glorious, heartbreaking, triumphant era. Here is Exodus",Fiction,Excellent,78,1,14,4.243589743589744,14,4.33,148,5.0,"10 Stars, if I Could!!!! 
 Much to my chagrin I have never read Leon Uris! Why I waited? I have no excuses to serve up. Uris writes BIG BOOKS that are quite spectacular. He is one of very few brilliant maestros in literature, in my opinion. He writes with an ease that kept me turning the 648 pages of this great masterpiece. His research into the facts of Palestine and the exoduses to her holy land is extensive and as factual as possible in pre-electronic 1958. His characters are so well developed that I felt each one was a member of my very own family. I cried and laughed with them. I felt their dreams and their pain and the blinding frustration as they followed their life long dream: Palestine! And certainly the British Empire would be their greatest friend, especially since they ratified the Palestine Mandate, right? Wrong. Why? Oil, of course. As the novel begins, the reader is introduced to the British duplicity. Caught on the Cyprus shoreline in British DP camps behind barbed wire are thousands of Jewish refugees waiting for transport to Ersatz-Israel after the conclusion of WW II. Foreign correspondent Mark Palmer and his childhood friend Kitty Fremont are reunited and enjoying the Cyprus sun after the long war in Europe. Since her husband and child's death, Kitty has been on the Greek Island working as a nurse in various orphanages. 
 Ari Ben Canaan, a very handsome sabra asks Mark to stay and will hand him an exclusive. The Mossad agent is going to smuggle 300 children to Palestine right under the British noses! They are to sail on the Exodus in two weeks time. He also needs the services of Fremont, but she is adamant: no. Yes, you guessed it. She eventually does, but only after she meets a young girl named Karen in the camps and hears David Ben Ami's tale of a ""historical abortion."" This tale begins in 1896 Russia and ends with the Rabinsky brothers in Ersatz-Israel many long and difficult years later. 
 We also learn Karen and Dov's stories: the young Jewish girl who Ari squirreled out of Germany and into Denmark and the quiet bitter concentration camp survivor who is more at home in the dark dank sewers under a Polish Ghetto than in the light. We meet the sabras: Dagna, David, Eli, Jordana, and Ari. This first generation of Ersatz-Israel are strong and focused. They are Israel. They work hard without complaint to reclaim the ""dead"" land and will fight to their death to see Palestine as the independent state of Israel. Death threatens on all sides, neither the Arabs nor the Brits want them there. The ship Exodus is both a symbol and a life dream. And Leon Uris's EXODUS is the perfect vessel to tell their stories!",18.0,1,47304,543522.96,11.49,711,5,5,3
203,The One And Only,Emily Giffin,2014,2014,"Thirty-three-year-old Shea Rigsby has spent her entire life in Walker, Texas--a small college town that lives and dies by football. Raised alongside her best friend Lucy, the daughter of Walker's legendary head coach Clive Carr, Shea was too devoted to her hometown team to leave. Instead she stayed in Walker for college, even taking a job in the university athletic department after graduation, where she has remained for more than a decade. But when an unexpected tragedy strikes the tight-knit Walker community, Shea's comfortable world is upended, and she begins to wonder if the life she's chosen is really enough for her. As she gives up her safety net to set out on an unexpected path, Shea discovers unsettling truths about the people and things she has always trusted most--and is forced to confront her deepest desires, fears, and secrets.",Fiction,Excellent,6,1,14,6.666666666666667,8,3.11,4661,1.0,"Here is what I learned from reading this book: 
 1. Emily Giffin's favorite word is ""smirk."" Her characters do a *lot* of smirking. If Emily had been allotted a certain number of uses of the word ""smirk"" (or ""smirked"" or ""smirking"") for the duration of her life, she would have used them all up in the 413 pages of this book. 
 2. Fictional Texans who treat football as a religion are almost as annoying as Texans who treat football as a religion IRL. 
 3. Ms. Giffin needs to learn that the phrase has to do with a bad feeling ""in the pit of one's stomach."" Here is a direct quote: ""I didn't answer her question, just turned and walked out the door, a pit in my stomach."" What kind of pit? A peach pit? An avocado pit? An armpit? 
 4. When I am inclined to quit reading a book because it's so annoying, I should listen to my inclinations. 
 For the record, I kept on with this one because I was waiting for the big payoff. I was doomed to disappointment. The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, the writing is clunky and amateurish, and Emily Giffin needs a much better editor.",61.0,1,4293,12836.070000000002,2.99,572,4,2,2

 WE CAN'T BE ALONE 
 The universe is a pretty big place. If it's just us, seems like an awful waste of space. 
 When I read this book, back then in 1997, I did it like a couple of months before of being able to watch the film adaptation. (And I am truly glad that I was able to get the movie in blu-ray, a few months ago in this year, 2014)) 
 This is truly great novel and it's written by one of the most respected scientist in the field about science of outer space, Carl Sagan. 
 Readers who enjoy techno-thrillers in the style of Michael Chrichton, I am sure that they will find this book the same as enjoyable. 
 Sagan is able to merge all his factual science knowledge with strong theories and very possible science fiction. 
 If you want to read about a ""first contact"" with an alien intelligence in a form as ""real"" as possible, this is your novel. 
 THAT MESMERIZING DARK SPACE 
 For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love. 
 Sagan never compromised his credibility as a real scientist just to sell cheap action in this novel. 
 This is a smart tale with many hard science, but also it contains great characters with exceptional developing. 
 Since after all, only science can't tell a story, there must be people, and people has feelings, and you will perceive them. 
 He knows what he is doing and you get a very realistic aproach of how you could expect the human civilization can deal with the impact of knowing that we are not alone in the universe anymore. 
 If you are looking for flying saucers blasting lasers and the army fighting bravely against them, this is NOT your book. I have nothing against that approach, don't get me wrong. I like that kind of stories too. But, I think that it's fair to have once in a while a mature angle to craft a story about the first meeting with an alien intelligence. 
 You have here a very intelligent story with a strong scientific background. 
 Nevertheless, Sagan knows that a novel must entertain, and you will be entertained but in a very adult and plausible way.",98.0,1,4563,36458.37,7.99,524,4,5,3

206,Unaccustomed Earth,Jhumpa Lahiri,2008,2008,"Eight stories--longer and more emotionally complex than any Lahiri has yet written--that take us from Cambridge and Seattle to India and Thailand as they enter the lives of sisters and brothers, fathers and mothers, daughters and sons, friends and lovers.
From the internationally best-selling, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, a superbly crafted new work of fiction: eight stories--longer and more emotionally complex than any she has yet written--that take us from Cambridge and Seattle to India and Thailand as they enter the lives of sisters and brothers, fathers and mothers, daughters and sons, friends and lovers.
In the stunning title story, Ruma, a young mother in a new city, is visited by her father, who carefully tends the earth of her garden, where he and his grandson form a special bond. But he's harboring a secret from his daughter, a love affair he's keeping all to himself. In ""A Choice of Accommodations,"" a husband's attempt to turn an old friend's wedding into a romantic getaway weekend with his wife takes a dark, revealing turn as the party lasts deep into the night. In ""Only Goodness,"" a sister eager to give her younger brother the perfect childhood she never had is overwhelmed by guilt, anguish, and anger when his alcoholism threatens her family. And in ""Hema and Kaushik,"" a trio of linked stories--a luminous, intensely compelling elegy of life, death, love, and fate--we follow the lives of a girl and boy who, one winter, share a house in Massachusetts. They travel from innocence to experience on separate, sometimes painful paths, until destiny brings them together again years later in Rome.
Unaccustomed Earth is rich with Jhumpa Lahiri's signature gifts: exquisite prose, emotional wisdom, and subtle renderings of the most intricate workings of the heart and mind. It is a masterful, dazzling work of a writer at the peak of her powers.",Fiction,Excellent,7,1,12,5.285714285714286,11,4.11,60903,4.0,"Eight short stories of remarkable depth, richness and resonance. Part one consists of five stand-alone stories, some of which have the density of novellas; part two consists of three stories that chronicle several decades in the lives of two characters whose lives have been fatefully intertwined. 
 Lahiri's protagonists might all be Bengalis from India taking root in America and then often abroad, but their secrets, hopes and dreams are universal. The stories' endings are particularly powerful, full of surprises that never feel gimmicky. 
 Stylistically, these are old-fashioned stories; you can see and feel Lahiri's debt to writers like William Trevor and Mavis Gallant in her clear, concise, insightful prose. There's little experimentation with form, and there's a certain sameness to settings and backgrounds (New England or New York City, ivy league colleages). She's equally good getting into the skin of men or women, young or old. 
 Like priceless gems, though, these stories seem simple and lovely on the surface but are carefully cut, chosen and polished, hiding layers of mystery.",33.0,1,28296,112901.04,3.99,903,5,4,2

He knows he is special when he is picked as a spy and kidnapper for his country, the glorious Democratic Republic of North Korea.
He knows he must find his true love, Sun Moon, the greatest opera star who ever lived, before it's too late.

Definitely
--back cover",Fiction,Excellent,1,15,15,15.0,12,4.06,453,5.0,"Adam Johnson's The Orphan Master's Son defies categories and captives the reader's attention end to end. We are brought face to face with the brutal inhumanity of the Kim Jong Il dictatorship (which the author visited and tried to depict as accurately as possible given the lack of defectors and their testimony). But the even deeper story was how much suffering and deprivation humans can endure while remaining human. 
 For another interesting take on North Korea, I would highly recommend Guy Delisle's comic book Pyongyang. 
 -POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW- 
 I liked how in the first half we are with Pak Jun Do as he lives his life from the orphanage until his imprisonment because he participated in the mission to America and then we change to Commander Ga and it takes a while for us to see that we are still talking about the same person. I suppose that this is typical of life in that dictatorship where individualism is punished so the question of identity is likely a critical one for sanity in PDRK (sp?). I also loved the Sun Moon character and would have been heartbroken had she not left. Similarly, the Dark Rower, Wanda, Comrade Buc...the characters here did feel three-dimensional and fleshed out. The descriptions of torture were hard to bear but then no worse in the end than those described in A Brief History of Killings - just the difference of it being killing on the outside in James as opposed to killing on the inside in Johnson. Given the fascist/totalitarian tendencies of today's world, I would highly recommend this book to remind us why we - in western democracies at least - need to be conscious and proud of our freedoms of speech and movement and rights to individual expression and be committed to never let anyone impinge on them.",79.0,1,4320,4276.8,0.99,1097,4,1,4

 Stuart Nadler's writing is uniquely driving and intensely captivating. I had a difficult time putting the book down and if not for other obligations, I would have finished it in a day. Nadler has a way of describing the situations involving his characters both efficiently and effectively. Throughout the book I found myself empathetic, uncomfortable and even awkward as I related to these people with an endearing attachment as though they were dear friends. 
 These stories have cliff-hanger timing. It angered me dearly as he would end one story and begin another at times that felt so inopportune to me that I found myself cursing him silently. I had become so invested in that story, it forced me to let go and move on to the next story, not knowing if things ever resolved themselves or if the characters were successful with their paths from that moment forward. I had no chance to negotiate with this 'Ghost of Christmas past' and perhaps stay for a moment longer onlooking.

But when their beloved father falls ill, these two estranged sisters will find themselves together again, standing alongside their disapproving mother, Anya, who even now offers no comfort to her daughters. On his deathbed, their father extracts a promise: Anya will tell her daughters a story; it is one she began years ago and never finished. This time she will tell it all the way to the end.
The tale their mother tells them is unlike anything they've heard before--a captivating, mysterious love story that spans more than sixty years and moves from frozen, war-torn Leningrad to modern-day Alaska. Nina's obsession to uncover the truth will send them all on an unexpected journey into their mother's past, where they will discover a secret so shocking, it shakes the foundation of their family and changes who they believe they are.
Mesmerizing from beginning to end, Winter Garden is that rarest of novels -- at once an epic love story and an intimate portrait of women poised at the crossroads of their lives. Evocative, lyrically written, and ultimately uplifting, it will haunt the listener long after the last word is spoken.",Fiction,Excellent,5,4,11,6.6,8,4.14,5498,5.0,"Meredith and Nina spent their whole lives without really knowing their mother Anya.

The story follows Meredith, Nina, and Anya as they get to know one another and grow closer and transition into different places in their individual lives. I really really enjoyed this book. This is the second book by Kristin Hannah that I read and I have been equally impressed by both. She really can tell a story because I was drawn in from start to finish.

A lot of it is valid, but there are certain times that he's the perfect author to be reading. Like last night when a winter storm blew through. Freezing temperatures, snow, ice, and high winds made it look like an Artic wasteland outside. As I lay reading under my warm blankets, I paused for a moment and listened to the wind making the house creak and the sleet hitting the windows, and thought, ""This is just about the perfect setting to be reading a Stephen King book."" The fact that it was a very damn good Stephen King book was an excellent bonus. 
 As if to give us a break after recent high page count books like Under the Dome and Duma Key, King delivers four short-n-sweet novellas focusing on the nastier sides of people with just a hint of the supernatural. These are four tales about the lives we build that we tell ourselves our safe, sane and secure, but there's always darkness lurking at the edges. King points out that sometimes we're the ones who invite that darkness in. 
 In 1922, a Depression-era farmer in the Midwest just wants to work with his son and read books in the evening, but his wife wants to sell some land her father left her to a hog factory and use the money to move to the city. When the two can't reach an agreement, the farmer decides to murder her and hide the body in an old well. Even worse, he manipulates his son into helping. What results is a chilling story of the unintended consequences that one crime and the ensuing guilt can cause. 
 Big Driver features Tess, an author who writes cozy mysteries about a group of elderly amateur female detectives that are popular with grandma-types. Taking a short cut home from a speaking/signing engagement, a flat tire leads to Tess being raped and left for dead. After escaping, Tess realizes that since she's a quasi-celebrity going to the police would result in a media firestorm that would taint the rest of her life so she decides to seek her own revenge. 
 Dave Streeter is a man with terminal cancer who gets a mysterious offer for fifteen more healthy years of life in Fair Extension, but he has to nominate someone to get a heaping dose of bad luck in his place. Since he's got a lot of resentment and grudges against his best friend Tom and his perfect life, Streeter decides that his old buddy deserves some misfortune. 
 The question in A Good Marriage is how well do you know your spouse? Darcy and Bob have been together 25 years and if things are a bit dull and ordinary at this point, they've built a good life and are generally content. When Bob's away on business, Darcy goes looking for batteries in the garage and discovers a horrifying secret that her husband has been keeping. 
 This is some of the best stuff that King has done in years. By focusing on human nature rather than supernatural monsters, he was able to create some very relatable yet scary stories. We know that we won't really be trapped in old hotels filled with ghosts or live in a town overrun by vampires or chased by demon cars that drive themselves. But getting a flat tire on a lonely road? Finding a dark secret about a spouse? Being jealous of a friend doing better than yourself? Watching your life unravel because of a bad decision you've tried to hide? Those are things that we really fear, and King uses them all skillfully to deliver some of his creepiest stories yet.",118.0,1,107,640.9300000000001,5.99,1236,1,4,1

When Lexi Baill moves into their small, close knit community, no one is more welcoming than Jude. Lexi, a former foster child with a dark past, quickly becomes Mia's best friend. Then Zach falls in love with Lexi and the three become inseparable.
Jude does everything to keep her kids safe and on track for college. It has always been easy--until senior year of high school. Suddenly she is at a loss. Nothing feels safe anymore; every time her kids leave the house, she worries about them.

NIGHT ROAD is vivid, emotionally complex novel that raises profound questions about motherhood, identity, love, and forgiveness. It is a luminous, heartbreaking novel that captures both the exquisite pain of loss and the stunning power of hope.

Surprisingly, I hadn't heard anything about this book until I went to vote on the 2011 Goodreads polls a few months ago. This book was nominated for best book of 2011, and the cover instantly stood out to me, and I think it's very beautiful. I read the synopsis, and at first was hesitant, because the title, and synopsis seemed to give me the impression that the book would be very predictable. Definitely not the case. 
 Jude lives in a small town raising her twins Mia and Zack. Along with her husband Miles, they seem to live the perfect life in their perfect little community. Zach is very popular, but Mia is quite reserved. One day at school Mia meets a girl named Lexi when she discovers her reading a book she likes. She warns Lexi that being her friend is social suicide, but Lexi doesn't care. Lexi was from a from a foster home, and has a dark past, but Jude welcomes her daughter's new friend. Eventually she becomes like one of the family, as they all get along so well. 
 When I first started reading I loved the writing style. I enjoyed the fact that it changed POV between a teen and a mom. I thought that was kind of unique. The characters were great. Lexi was one of the most wonderfully written characters I have ever read about. The way she grows as a person in this book is simply astonishing. Jude was another well developed character that I could really relate to as a mom. She was over the top at times, in terms of her overbearing methods, but her heart was always in the right place. Every character in this story loves completely with all their heart. The supporting characters shined as well. The relationships between Lexi/Jude, Lexi/Mia, Lexi/Zach, and Zach/Mia were very well done. 
 This book has so many twists, and some are so major you wonder if you are still reading the same book. Hannah will take your emotions all over the place. One minute you will be laughing along with the family, one minute in tears, and another minute feeling angry about things that are going on. You will never be bored for a second reading this book, and I actually read it in one sitting, because I just had to know what would happen next. 
 I feel like this book sends lots of great messages about love, loss, forgiveness, acceptance and much more,and I feel she can send her messages in a positive way without ever sounding preachy. Night Road is an emotionally complex book, and it's truly unforgettable. This is my first book of Hannah's, and I will definitely be checking out more of her books! 
 I really think this is a book that can be enjoyed by teens and adults alike, but I do feel us moms can truly appreciate it the most.",76.0,1,106,104.94,0.99,1272,1,1,4
212,Star Island,Carl Hiaasen,2010,2011,"Meet 22-year-old Cherry Pye (nee Cheryl Bunterman), a pop star since she was fourteen-and about to attempt a comeback from her latest drug-and-alcohol disaster.
Now meet Cherry again: in the person of her ""undercover stunt double,"" Ann DeLusia. Ann portrays Cherry whenever the singer is too ""indisposed""-- meaning wasted -- to go out in public. And it is Ann-mistaken-for-Cherry who is kidnapped from a South Beach hotel by obsessed paparazzo Bang Abbott.
Now the challenge for Cherry's handlers (uber-stage mother; horndog record producer; nipped, tucked, and Botoxed twin publicists; weed whacker-wielding bodyguard) is to rescue Ann while keeping her existence a secret from Cherry's public -- and from Cherry herself. The situation is more complicated than they know. Ann has had a bewitching encounter with Skink, the unhinged former governor of Florida living wild in a mangrove swamp, and now he's heading for Miami to find her . . .
Will Bang Abbott achieve his fantasy of a lucrative private photo session with Cherry Pye? Will Cherry sober up in time to lip-synch her way through her concert tour? Will Skink track down Ann DeLusia before Cherry's motley posse does? All will be revealed in this hilarious spin on life in the celebrity fast lane.",Fiction,Excellent,7,2,14,6.428571428571429,1,3.44,212,4.0,"Carl Hiaasen returns to form by switching up. Star Island gives the author's despoliation-of-Florida theme a rest by providing him with another target for his considerable store of outrage: pop celebrity. 
 The chief offender is Cheryl ""Cherry Pye"" Bunterman, a teenage Britney manque with a singing voice ""like a sack of starving kittens"" and a dysfunctional entourage that enables (and covers up) her many assaults on common sense. Her perfect foil is overweight, self-deluded paparazzo Bing Abbott. Together, they'll make you fear for the future of the species. 
 Hiaasen has plowed this turf before (ten years ago, in Basket Case), but here he lets out the stops. He doesn't need to condemn Cherry, her clueless parents, conniving twin PR gurus, or the ""maggot mob"" of paparazzi; he simply gets out of their way and through pitch-perfect portraits lets them hang themselves with their own words and actions. A few stock Hiaasen characters show up -- the grotesque sociopathic thug, the venal real-estate developer -- but at least there's no obvious stand-in for the author, which relieves the plot of some of the fantasy wish-fulfillment tropes that have marred some of his more recent works. 
 Star Island is crazy, profane, nasty fun. If you've had your fill of reality-TV ""personalities"" and marginally talented ""entertainers"", you should enjoy watching them get skewered in this book. If you're already a Hiaasen fan, you'll enjoy seeing him break out of his formula and regain his satirical mojo. Either way, enjoy the ride.",2.0,1,237,708.63,2.99,376,1,3,1

In the years that follow, each must face the consequences of that single night and find a way to forget...or the courage to forgive.
NIGHT ROAD is vivid, emotionally complex novel that raises profound questions about motherhood, identity, love, and forgiveness. It is a luminous, heartbreaking novel that captures both the exquisite pain of loss and the stunning power of hope. This is Kristin Hannah at her very best, telling an unforgettable story about the longing for family, the resilience of the human heart, and the courage it takes to forgive the people we love.",Fiction,Excellent,2,5,11,8.0,3,4.17,59265,5.0,"This is definitely a book I will be recommending to friends for a long time. Surprisingly, I hadn't heard anything about this book until I went to vote on the 2011 Goodreads polls a few months ago. This book was nominated for best book of 2011, and the cover instantly stood out to me, and I think it's very beautiful. I read the synopsis, and at first was hesitant, because the title, and synopsis seemed to give me the impression that the book would be very predictable. Definitely not the case. 
 Jude lives in a small town raising her twins Mia and Zack. Along with her husband Miles, they seem to live the perfect life in their perfect little community. Zach is very popular, but Mia is quite reserved. One day at school Mia meets a girl named Lexi when she discovers her reading a book she likes. She warns Lexi that being her friend is social suicide, but Lexi doesn't care. Lexi was from a from a foster home, and has a dark past, but Jude welcomes her daughter's new friend. Eventually she becomes like one of the family, as they all get along so well. 
 When I first started reading I loved the writing style. I enjoyed the fact that it changed POV between a teen and a mom. I thought that was kind of unique. The characters were great. Lexi was one of the most wonderfully written characters I have ever read about. The way she grows as a person in this book is simply astonishing. Jude was another well developed character that I could really relate to as a mom. She was over the top at times, in terms of her overbearing methods, but her heart was always in the right place. Every character in this story loves completely with all their heart. The supporting characters shined as well. The relationships between Lexi/Jude, Lexi/Mia, Lexi/Zach, and Zach/Mia were very well done. 
 This book has so many twists, and some are so major you wonder if you are still reading the same book. Hannah will take your emotions all over the place. One minute you will be laughing along with the family, one minute in tears, and another minute feeling angry about things that are going on. You will never be bored for a second reading this book, and I actually read it in one sitting, because I just had to know what would happen next. 
 I feel like this book sends lots of great messages about love, loss, forgiveness, acceptance and much more,and I feel she can send her messages in a positive way without ever sounding preachy. Night Road is an emotionally complex book, and it's truly unforgettable. This is my first book of Hannah's, and I will definitely be checking out more of her books! 
 I really think this is a book that can be enjoyed by teens and adults alike, but I do feel us moms can truly appreciate it the most.",76.0,1,106,104.94,0.99,1272,1,2,4
214,The Chosen,Chaim Potok,1967,2010,"Love or duty -- which would you choose? Prince Severin has been brought up to put duty before all else. Now, his duty is to marry and produce an heir. He has his choice of princesses. Unfortunately, his passion is for princes. Havyn has been a slave all his life. When his powers are discovered, he finds himself purchased and freed by a Prince and apprenticed to the royal wizard, Ildar. His duty is to stay chaste to keep his powers strong. Unfortunately, his passion is for Severin. With kingdoms at war, the throne hanging in the balance, and magic in the air, can the two men find happiness together, or is duty more important than love?",Fiction,Excellent,39,1,10,4.425,5,3.21,31,3.0,"The Chosen is a classic fantasy novel but without the epic length. Included are long journeys, prophesies, royalty, magic, oracles, wars at stake, forbidden love, runaway elopements, long lost princes, lengthy quests, true love, and a happy ending. Because the story stays pretty true to the fantasy origins, there is not originality offered but for those fans of the genre, the familiar themes are always welcome. The writing makes the story incredibly easy and fast to read so that kept my interest whereas if the pace had dragged I would have been bored. The characters are again right out of fantasy lore so nothing surprising but they are warm and likable. As a first novel, this is a decent fantasy offering that may be of interest to classic fantasy tales. 
 Severin is a prince out on a journey with his faithful wizard Ildar to find himself after a lifetime of being spoiled at his parent's whim. Severin buys Havyn at a slave auction, intending to free the man once they return to his home. Along the way, they discover Havyn has magical ability and Ildar quickly makes the ex-slave his new wizard's apprentice. Life isn't easy once they reach home though as Severin is set to wed the niece of a neighboring land, yet his chemistry with Havyn causes havoc for both. When the royal family and entourage set out for the betrothal ceremony, there is no end of problems. Murder, intrigue, runaways, long lost royalty, quests, true love, and a happy ending are all involved as the various characters find their way in this realm of magic and mystery. 
 There is a lot going on in this story but surprisingly, the plot never feels overwhelmed or too fast. Each issue brought up is well handled and builds upon the next so each piece is simply part of a bigger, more complicated whole. Some of the elements are pretty predictable and the story on the whole isn't wildly original. Often the plot feels obvious as the fantasy themes used are easy to identify so there is not a lot of suspense or wonder associated with reading. Yet the writing keeps the pace quick and characters interesting enough that even those who have read this type of story all the time will keep turning the page here. 
 Part of this is that the characters are pretty decent. Severin and Havyn narrate the story in alternating third person point of view and for the most part they stay well within the predictable roles. Havyn is slightly over the top with the orphan childhood sold into slavery from birth and never known a bath, clothing, food, or kindness. However this exaggeration is pretty typical of everyone in the book. All the characters seem to exist on the extremes of their description and supposedly almost all are virgins, which is necessary to fill their various roles. This is a bit of a stretch especially at the end when several of these mandates are flipped to provide a happy ending, but it didn't really bother me since it was clearly coming. 
 The various characters have a bit of charm, a bit of scheming, and some interest which kept me reading even though I knew what would happen - usually a sign I give up and become bored. Yet again, there's an ease to the writing that lets you enjoy the classic tale even if there is nothing surprising. The common themes are well loved for a reason and even though just about all used here, it pretty much works. This isn't a book that leaves you breathless but it is one you enjoy while reading. Or at least I mostly did.",7.0,1,4320,8596.8,1.99,1099,4,5,3
215,Mystic River,Dennis Lehane,2001,2002,,Fiction,Excellent,9,6,13,9.22222222222222,1,4.18,164,5.0,"Once upon a time, three boys were fighting in the street when two men claiming to be plainclothes cops show up. One kid gets in the car, the others stay put, and their lives will never be the same. Decades later, Dave Boyle, the kid who got into the car, is accused of killing the daughter of Jimmy Marcus, one of the other boys, and the third boy has grown up to be Sean Devine, the cop in charge of the case. Did Boyle do it? And if he didn't, can Sean find the real killer? 
 Yeah, 2013 was supposed to be the year of Dennis Lehane for me. It probably would have been had I not discovered George Pelecanos. However, I'm back aboard the Lehane Train now and quite pleased. 
 While Mystic River is normally classified as a thriller, it's so much more than that, an exploration of growing up and what a traumatic childhood event can blossom into. Mystic River is the tale of three Boston boys who grew up to be very different Boston men. Dave Boyle has drifted from job to job, never quite managing to bury his abduction experience. Jimmy Marcus is a former career criminal who has gone straight and become a family man. And Sean Devine is a cop with a wife he hasn't seen in over a year and a child he's not sure is his. 
 From the beginning, Lehane kept the waters sufficiently muddy to hold my interest. While I knew I was supposed to assume Dave Boyle killed Katie Marcus, Lehane had me changing my opinion quite a few times. None of the three leads are very simple characters. Dave's got his childhood baggage but still tries to be the best husband and father he can be. Jimmy was once a criminal and is still a hard man but is a loving family man. Sean is a supercop but his marriage is in ruins and he's coming off a suspension for something very petty. 
 Once Sean is on the case, the book becomes very hard to put down, like it's been duct-taped to your hands. The mystery, unlike a lot of them these days, is solvable and I guessed who the killer was about 75% of the way through, even though I got the motive wrong. 
 The writing is everything I came to expect from the Kenzie and Gennaro series and then some. I think this is the book where Dennis Lehane went from ""Good Thriller Writer"" to simply ""Great Writer."" 
 Five stars. I suppose I'll track down the movie now.",94.0,1,43848,394193.52,8.99,739,5,1,3
216,Tell No One,Harlan Coben,2001,2009,"For Dr. David Beck, the loss was shattering. And every day for the past eight years, he has relived the horror of what happened. The gleaming lake. The pale moonlight. The piercing screams. The night his wife was taken. The last night he saw her alive.
Everyone tells him it's time to move on, to forget the past once and for all. But for David Beck, there can be no closure. A message has appeared on his computer, a phrase only he and his dead wife know. Suddenly Beck is taunted with the impossible- that somewhere, somehow, Elizabeth is alive.
Beck has been warned to tell no one. And he doesn't. Instead, he runs from the people he trusts the most, plunging headlong into a search for the shadowy figure whose messages hold out a desperate hope.
But already Beck is being hunted down. He's headed straight into the heart of a dark and deadly secret- and someone intends to stop him before he gets there.",Fiction,Excellent,2,13,15,14.0,11,4.11,79640,5.0,"OH MY LORD! Coben delivers again!! I'm always left in awe after reading one of his mysteries and this time I was thrown all over the place! 
 This is truly a spine tingling, fast paced, game changing novel. It was such a page turner that I stayed up late to finish it, I just had to know what happened! 
 This book is awesome. It begins with Beck and his wife at the lake for their anniversary. The night begins nicely for the couple until Elizabeth's scream pierces the air and Beck is attacked. When he wakes he is told his wife is..... Dead. 
 Eight years later Beck is at work and gets a strange email..... And from there the chase is on. Is Elizabeth dead or not? Beck goes from being a doctor to knocking down cops in the matter of one day. 
 Coben has a way of pulling every single character in the book back to one event... He knows how to pull them back in like a magnet. 
 I swear Coben is one of the best authors I've read. The books are thrilling, page turners and I can't get enough of them. Sometimes I have to go back and reread parts to make sure I got them right.

217,The Shell Seekers,Rosamunde Pilcher,1988,1987,"Set in London and Cornwall from World War II to the present, Rosamunde Pilcher tells the story of the Keeling family, and of the passions and heartbreak that have held them together for three generations. The family centers around Penelope, and it is her love, courage, and sense of values that determine the course of all their lives,
One of Penelope's most treasured possessions is The Shell Seekers, which her father painted and left her as a remembrance and a legacy. It is this painting that symbolizes to Penelope the ties between the generations. It is the link between the past, the present, and the future. But it is the fate of this painting that just may tear the family apart....
Rosamunde Pilcher's writing demonstrates a deep sensitivity to human frailties, desires, and joys. She weaves a story that bursts with emotion, so involving it is impossible to put down. The world she creates and opens up to you becomes a place you feel comfortable, a place you can't wait to return to, a place you will never forget.",Fiction,Excellent,47,6,15,10.340425531914894,11,4.13,219,5.0,"""The most ordinary of prospects caused her to stop and stare. The last of the leaves dropped from the trees, and the bare branches made lace against pale skies. Sun after rain turned cobbled streets blue as fish scales, dazzling to the eye. Autumn winds, whipping the bay to a scud of white-caps, brought with them, not cold, but a surging sense of vitality..."" 
 Penelope Keeling knows how to live life to the fullest and I absolutely adore her! She grasps those things that matter most in life - the comfort of a home, the security of a loving mother, the laughter of friends and family, the feel of soil and the beauty of the outdoors, the enticing smells of home-cooked meals, and the allure of a splendid painting. When I come across a character in one of my books that touches me and makes me want to re-examine my own life, then I know I have found a gem. 
 Of course, we're all familiar with the phrase ""don't judge a book by its cover"". Unfortunately, I have been guilty of that offense in the past and no less so with this book. I have seen Rosamunde Pilcher's novels in bookstores and libraries and have admittedly walked right on by due to their overly feminine and botanic covers. I didn't think they were ""my sort of book"". However, I decided to give this one a try when I discovered some trusted Goodreads friends were reading this. Well, thank goodness I did - such a true delight! At the outset, we learn that Penelope is a sixty-four-year old widow that has had a surprise glimpse at her own mortality. We are introduced to her three adult children - Nancy, Olivia and Noel - as well as others that have touched her life at some point or another - her treasured mother and father, an ill-suited husband, a loyal friend, a devoted lover, a grieving young woman and a secretive yet trustworthy gardener. Each character is drawn with such depth and clarity that I felt I really knew each and every one of them. The title of this novel, The Shell Seekers, derives from a painting given to Penelope by her father, the prominent artist Lawrence Stern. When the now deceased Lawrence Stern's works of art become much sought-after, the value of this and other pieces increases significantly. Each of Penelope's children have their own thoughts about what should be done with this and other works in their mother's possession. What they desire reveals to us much about each of them, their innermost substance. As with real people, what we see is not all pretty. Pilcher has the gift of depicting riveting family dynamics. ""Family rows are like car accidents. Every family thinks, 'It couldn't happen to us,' but it can happen to everybody. The only way to avoid them is to drive with the greatest care and have much consideration for others."" 
 Penelope makes a journey to Cornwall, both in spirit and literally, where she sweeps us along to revel in the landscape and her own cherished memories. I loved every minute of this visit and will miss my time spent with Penelope. Heart-warming, memorable, and a bit of a tear-jerker, The Shell Seekers is a treasure I won't soon forget. I am quite pleased that several more Rosamunde Pilcher novels now grace my bookshelf with their blossoming covers and their promise of comfort and pure reading satisfaction.",135.0,1,35424,176765.76,4.99,811,5,2,2
218,The Gathering Storm,Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson,2009,2015,"Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, looms. And mankind is not ready.
The final volume of the Wheel of Time, ""A Memory of Light, "" was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson, ""New York Times"" bestselling author of the Mistborn books, was chosen by Jordan's editor--his wife, Harriet McDougal--to complete the final book. The scope and size of the volume was such that it could not be contained in a single book, and so Tor proudly presents ""The Gathering Storm"" as the first of three novels that will cover the outline left by Robert Jordan, chronicling Tarmon Gai'don and Rand al'Thor's final confrontation with the Dark One. This short sequence will complete the struggle against the Shadow, bringing to a close a journey begun almost twenty years ago and marking the conclusion of the Wheel of Time, the preeminent fantasy epic of our era.
In this epic novel, Robert Jordan's international bestselling series begins its dramatic conclusion. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward--wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders--his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.
Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower--and possibly the world itself.
The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.",Fiction,Excellent,8,1,15,9.375,5,4.35,40,5.0,"'The Gathering Storm' is book 12 in 'The Wheel of Time' series, but it is the first book in the 'The Final Battle' trilogy, the last three books in the series. Incidentally, these final three books are written by Brandon Sanderson and not by Robert Jordan, who has passed away. I did not notice much difference in style (with the exception that the women do less folding of arms and pouting). The important thing is Jordan had notes and spoke about how he wanted the series to end, so Sanderson had an idea of what shape the Grand Finale would take. 
 And WOW! 'The Gathering Storm' was amazing! Egwene and Rand learn hard lessons about leadership in fighting their wars, while Perrin and Mat are reluctantly being drawn by their ta'veren connection to Rand into joining him at last (they haven't been in the same place for ten books). Perrin and Mat like to keep as far from Rand as he allows, but that is ending in 'The Gathering Storm'. (cue ominous music) Rand's outrage and continuing dark emo at being selected as the Dragon Reborn rings authentic to me (he wanted a normal life as a sheepherder and farmer, a life from which he has been ripped away, and instead he has been pushed into a world of blood, violence and unwanted sacrifice) but the sudden conversion by embracing Love in his Judean mountain moment - third temptation - did not. After I picked myself up from the floor after the condition prolonged helpless laughter left me, I decided this one scene was not going to deter me from enjoying the series. It is a Fantasy, after all. 
 Note: there is NO WAY to enjoy these books or understand what is going on without beginning with Book 1, The Eye of the World. 
 p.s. if you have any spanking perversions OR aversions, this series will be interesting for you on some, perhaps previously unknown, levels. I am finding the subject vaguely more interesting myself as I go along.",3.0,1,5076,20253.24,3.99,473,4,2,2

Policeman Jonas Holly faces a precarious journey into the warped mind of the kidnapper if he's to stand any chance of catching him. But - still reeling from a personal tragedy - is Jonas really up to the task?

Reading this so soon after Darkside kept characters fresh and I wish now that I had read the three books in fairly quick succession. Reading so much crime fiction I find sometimes characters can get lost in my head as I go from book to book. 
 Again we're treated to a brilliant storyline that had me gripped once I became immersed. The characters, settings sucking me in without even realising it. I couldn't put it down once I had picked it up again after being unwell for a while. It was just the thing to get me out of a reading slump and give me my mojo back. 
 I cannot recommend Ms Bauer's books enough and this trilogy, in my humble opinion, is an absolute 'must read' for absorbing storylines and characters whose lives you begin to feel a part of.

Each side will twist the evidence to win its case, and try any procedural ploy, any courtroom trick that might ensure victory. Rusty's ordeal will uncover corruption, deceit, depravity and incompetence-- and keep you spellbound. Who did kill Carolyn Polhemus?",Fiction,Excellent,41,1,15,3.840909090909091,8,4.1,92752,4.0,"This is one of the best books that I have read recently. It is a great legal thriller cum murder mystery. No wonder the book finds mention in both the top 100 mystery/crime novel lists published by the Britain-based Crime Writers' Association and by the Mystery Writers of America. Both the lists were published in the nineties and feature some of the finest specimens of crime writing. The lists can be found here - Link 
 The story is narrated by Rozat K. Sabich aka Rusty, chief deputy prosecutor of Kindle county who is also the protagonist. The story begins with the murder of Carolyn, another prosecuting attorney, with whom Rusty had an affair and never got over his obsession of her. Rusty gets the responsibility of investigating the crime but himself ends up getting accused of the murder and faces trial. 
 The book features some really great court room scenes, complex characters and portrays so many human emotions and frailties. Illicit passion, betrayal, corruption, dirty politics, jealousy, friendship, paternal feelings, family bonds - everything finds a place in the story. The author has also explained quite a few legal technicalities which makes it easier for the reader to understand some of the complexities of the trial. The mystery is excellent and the very few would be able to guess the identity of the culprit. 
 Rusty, accustomed to putting criminals behind bars, is now the accused and feels how is it to be on the other side. He talks about his obsession with Carolyn, his childhood, his strained relationship with his wife, his fear of missing out his son's childhood if he is sent to prison. Some of his ramblings is actually a bit boring and do not fit in the story.The author's use of the English language is impressive but somehow I felt at times it was not compatible with the character or the story. e.g. a person, who is a prosecutor not a poet, facing a murder charge is unlikely to use phrases like ""doors and windows of my soul are thrown open to a fundamental gratitude"". It is my only criticism of the novel. 
 The book is not just a thriller but Scott Turow's attempt to explore the intricacies of the human mind and he has done a commendable job. I would recommend the book to lovers of legal thrillers, murder mysteries, psychological thrillers if he/she does not mind the ramblings of the protagonist.",52.0,1,4995,14935.05,2.99,479,4,5,4
221,The Underground Railroad,Colson Whitehead,2016,2016,"Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. Life is hellish for all the slaves but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood - where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned and, though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.
In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor - engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven - but the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. Even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.
As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroadis at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.",Fiction,Excellent,37,1,16,7.432432432432432,11,4.03,86839,4.0,"Excellent writing, strong concept. I am personally burnt out on slavery narratives so I cannot say this was a pleasure to read. So much unrelenting horror. Whitehead does an excellent job of portraying slavery and America as a slave nation. The idea of the underground railroad, as an actual railroad, is so smart and interesting. I wish he had actually done more with the railroad itself. There were some sentences where I thought, ""Now you are just showing off."" The amount of research the author did is clear, throughout. There is some really interesting structural work at play. I wanted some of the secondary characters to be more fully developed.

222,The Longest Ride,Nicholas Sparks,2013,2013,"Ira Levinson is in trouble. At ninety-one years old, in poor health and alone in the world, he finds himself stranded on an isolated embankment after a car crash. Suffering multiple injuries, he struggles to retain consciousness until a blurry image materializes and comes into focus beside him: his beloved wife Ruth, who passed away nine years ago. Urging him to hang on, she forces him to remain alert by recounting the stories of their lifetime together - how they met, the precious paintings they collected together, the dark days of WWII and its effect on them and their families. Ira knows that Ruth can't possibly be in the car with him, but he clings to her words and his memories, reliving the sorrows and everyday joys that defined their marriage.
A few miles away, at a local rodeo, a Wake Forest College senior's life is about to change. Recovering from a recent break-up, Sophia Danko meets a young cowboy named Luke, who bears little resemblance to the privileged frat boys she has encountered at school. Through Luke, Sophia is introduced to a world in which the stakes of survival and success, ruin and reward -- even life and death - loom large in everyday life. As she and Luke fall in love, Sophia finds herself imagining a future far removed from her plans -- a future that Luke has the power to rewrite . . . if the secret he's keeping doesn't destroy it first.
Ira and Ruth. Sophia and Luke. Two couples who have little in common, and who are separated by years and experience. Yet their lives will converge with unexpected poignancy, reminding us all that even the most difficult decisions can yield extraordinary journeys: beyond despair, beyond death, to the farthest reaches of the human heart.",Fiction,Excellent,16,1,13,6.75,7,4.13,73144,4.0,"I don't recall ever associating the quality of being ''humane'' to a book before, but here I am doing just that for ''The Longest Ride.'' 
 The word came to my mind as I was reading the long and eloquent descriptions of many different emotions the characters are feeling in this powerful story. It didn't only feel as if the writer humanly described those emotions; it felt as if the book itself felt compassion for its ''actors.'' 
 But feel free to raise an eyebrow, because this is a little strange, I admit. Novels are not alive. Anyways. 
 Nicholas Sparks writes about love stories and strong, realistic issues in relationships, but I feel as if he really gave his everything in this one special book (which he says was one of his favourite stories to write). 
 There are many moments when I felt my stomach ache for Ira's dire situation and the seemingly uncertain and, at times, hopeless future of Sophia and Luke. Oh and that ending. I got shivers when I watched the movie, and I got shivers when I read the book. 
 Sparks' stories always have that peculiar fairy-tale-esque feel to them, though it's subtle enough not to become annoying. It's simply that he writes such romantic stories. He believes in true love and destiny and he clearly shows that through his novels. 
 Although he is such a beloved author, I never know for sure if I'm going to love his books before starting them. I disliked ''The Notebook,'' loved ''Dear John,'' thought ''The Lucky One'' was good but no more, found ''The Last Song'' wonderful and, finally ADORED ''The Longest Ride.'' See, I may like this author, but that doesn't guarantee my enjoyment of his works. 
 Very recommend. I also dare suggest the movie, despite the modifications made to the original story.

Instead she stayed in Walker for college, even taking a job in the university athletic department after graduation, where she has remained for more than a decade. But when an unexpected tragedy strikes the tight-knit Walker community, Shea's comfortable world is upended, and she begins to wonder if the life she's chosen is really enough for her. As she gives up her safety net to set out on an unexpected path, Shea discovers unsettling truths about the people and things she has always trusted most--and is forced to confront her deepest desires, fears, and secrets.",Fiction,Excellent,6,1,14,6.666666666666667,8,3.11,4661,1.0,"Here is what I learned from reading this book:

224,The Secret Keeper,Kate Morton,2012,2012,"During a summer party at the family farm in the English countryside, sixteen-year-old Laurel Nicolson has escaped to her childhood tree house and is happily dreaming of the future. She spies a stranger coming up the long road to the farm and watches as her mother speaks to him. Before the afternoon is over, Laurel will witness a shocking crime. A crime that challenges everything she knows about her family and especially her mother, Dorothy--her vivacious, loving, nearly perfect mother.
Now, fifty years later, Laurel is a successful and well-regarded actress living in London. The family is gathering at Greenacres farm for Dorothy's ninetieth birthday. Realizing that this may be her last chance, Laurel searches for answers to the questions that still haunt her from that long-ago day, answers that can only be found in Dorothy's past.
Dorothy's story takes the reader from pre-WWII England through the blitz, to the '60s and beyond. It is the secret history of three strangers from vastly different worlds--Dorothy, Vivien, and Jimmy--who meet by chance in wartime London and whose lives are forever entwined. The Secret Keeper explores longings and dreams and the unexpected consequences they sometimes bring. It is an unforgettable story of lovers and friends, deception and passion that is told--in Morton's signature style--against a backdrop of events that changed the world.",Fiction,Excellent,4,8,16,13.5,7,4.13,91940,5.0,"I had this mystery figured out at least five different times throughout the book.

226,North And South,John Jakes,1982,2012,"Written at the request of Charles Dickens, North and South is a book about rebellion; it poses fundamental questions about the nature of social authority and obedience. Gaskell expertly blends individual feeling with social concern, and her heroine, Margaret Hale, is one of the most original creations of Victorian literature.
When Margaret Hale's father leaves the Church in a crisis of conscience she is forced to leave her comfortable home in the tranquil countryside of Hampshire and move with her family to the fictional industrial town of Milton in the north of England. Though at first disgusted by her new surroundings, she witnesses the brutality wrought by the Industrial Revolution and becomes aware of the poverty and suffering of the local mill workers. Sympathetic to the poor she makes friends among them and develops a fervent sense of social justice. She clashes with the mill-owner and self-made man, John Thornton, who is contemptuous of his workers. However, their fierce opposition masks a deeper attraction.
Gaskell based her depiction of Milton on Manchester, where she lived as the wife of a Unitarian minister. She was an accomplished writer, much of her work published in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words including North and South which was originally published as a serial. She was also friends with Charlotte Bronte and after her death, her father, Patrick Bronte, chose Gaskell to write The Life of Charlotte Bronte.",Fiction,Excellent,33,1,14,5.545454545454546,8,4.13,826,4.0,It's Pride and Prejudice for Socialists.,455.0,1,58968,235282.32,3.99,653,5,4,2

Running for his life, but not before he picks up a bloodstained letter opener that puts the president at the scene of the crime, the burglar becomes the target of a clandestine manhunt orchestrated by leading members of the executive branch.
Meanwhile, Jack Graham, once a public defender and now a high-powered corporate attorney, gets drawn into the case because the on-the-lam burglar just happens to be the father of his former financee, a crusading Virginia prosecutor.
Embroidering the narrative through assorted plot whorls are the hero's broken romance; his conflict over selling out for financial success; the prosecutor's confused love-hate for her burglar father; the relentless investigation by a northern Virginia career cop; the dilemma of government agents trapped in a moral catch-22; the amoral ambitions of a sexy White House Chief of Staff; and the old burglar's determination to bring down the ruthless president.

 So, I loved the Dark Tower series. It's one of the best works of fantasy I've read. If you haven't started it: 
 a) do so 
 b) don't read the spoilers here 
 The Dark Tower series is an incredibly varied set of books, written over the course of more than 30 years - written by a young man starting out on a wholly uncertain writing future - written by an old man looking back on a glittering career - and punctuated by all his experiences, discoveries, epiphanies. King brings all his talents to these pages ... and some of his weaknesses. You should read it, it is (forgive the pun) a towering work of imagination and characterization. 
 *** 
 This last volume is a curious mix for me, containing some great writing, an amazingly good idea for ending what must have been a very difficult tale to end well, and in some places some bewilderingly disappointing execution. This mix of brilliance and weakness has resulted in the 3* up top. 
 Below I venture into the deepest realms of spoiler-land, pontificating on the ending. Don't go there if you've not read the book, really. 
 Really! Don't spoil it for yourself 
 So. Randalf Flag, Susannah's baby, and most of all the Crimson King were all huge anticlimaxes for me. Given the nature of the ending and King's skill I wonder if these weren't perhaps intended to be anticlimaxes with everything turning out to be less impressive, less important, more shabby and spoiled than it had been built up to be in Roland's mind. In book 4/5 we see that anything can be magic, with Dodge gearsticks performing as magic wands. Perhaps here we see that anything can be your arch-nemesis and the undoing of the world - it's us (or Roland) who invests them with that power and at the end of it all he sees them for what they are? Who knows. Either way as a reader finding the Crimson King who has sat at the heart of this epic for decades, and finding him to be an unimpressive grenade-lobbing old man with no special powers, no wisdom or insights ... offering no closure ... well it didn't sit well. Perhaps this was intentional - to give me the same empty feeling Roland gets in the end, but it didn't quite work for this reader. I felt short-changed. 
 The idea for the close of the story, the coup de grace, is brilliant. But it could have been spelled out more clearly perhaps. A tough call since you don't want to over do it. 
 The end message (that I took at least) is that the journey was (and is for all of us) the important thing. Not the ending. And that if we set our sights on the end goal and sacrifice everything to get it, we will lose out on every level. Roland, who we admired for his unflinching commitment to the cause, for the doggedness with which he pursued the tower, is doomed to start at the beginning and repeat the hunt yet again for Ka is a wheel and he is bound to it. The strengths we saw in him, the willingness to sacrifice everything, even friends at the very end, are now shown as his weaknesses. His only chance to leave the wheel and find peace is to see this truth - that the important things are those he sacrifices time and again. His singularity of purpose is his curse, not his strength - the friendships and loves he encounters in the NOW are what matters, not the paper-thin Crimson King trapped in an empty tower. The path he plots toward the tower is the crucial thing - not if he gets there. 
 This is a beautiful, powerful way to conclude such an epic and I applaud King for his vision. I just wish he'd written it in a way that connected better with me when I read it.

 PERFECT TITLE 
 The title for this novel, Intensity... 
 ...is truly well selected since this book is indeed... 
 ...intense!!! 
 You are barely getting confortable, starting to read the book, just a few pages, when... 
 Bam! Kapow! Toma guacho! 
 The horror begins! 
 So, if you are a horror novel where you don't have to wait much to be full immersed in the action, don't look anymore! This is it! You found the book! 
 NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART 
 I have read quite several books by Koontz and... 
 ...I was shocked by the crudity of the very first scenes. 
 I told myself (back then in 2007): ""Dang! He (Koontz) is not fooling around! The villain, in this novel, is truly a grim, dark and twisted sonofa..."". 
 Another of the most shocking things in this book, since you don't have any paranormal/sci-fi elements here (that's an usual trait by Koontz), all the horror here is made by somebody that it's quite ""just"" a human being... 
 ...but don't fool yourself, since the villain here can scare more than the fiercest demon that you may encounter in other novel. 
 Even when you think that you can't get surprised anymore by him... 
 ...wrong! 
 You'll get even more surprised... 
 ...oh, yes... 
 ... and even more afraid. 
 Trust me. 
 You'll meet true evil, truly human. 
 BOLD HEROINE 
 And since you have a really scary bad man... 
 ...the only fair thing is to have a really awesome great woman. 
 I like the heroine here since I think that she acted in very logical way and every action that she does is well motivated and reasoned. 
 She doesn't have special skills like martial arts or anything, but she certainly have guts, have brains, and have common sense. 
 The story actually has very few characters beyond the villain and the heroine, but still you will have plenty of reading, plenty of development,...

230,Cannery Row,John Steinbeck,1945,2002,"Cannery Rowis a book without much of a plot. Rather, it is an attempt to capture the feeling and people of a place, the cannery district of Monterey, California, which is populated by a mix of those down on their luck and those who choose for other reasons not to live ""up the hill"" in the more respectable area of town. The flow of the main plot is frequently interrupted by short vignettes that introduce us to various denizens of the Row, most of whom are not directly connected with the central story. These vignettes are often characterized by direct or indirect reference to extreme violence: suicides, corpses, and the cruelty of the natural world.
The ""story"" of Cannery Rowfollows the adventures of Mack and the boys, a group of unemployed yet resourceful men who inhabit a converted fish-meal shack on the edge of a vacant lot down on the Row.
Sweet Thursday is the sequel to Cannery Row.",Fiction,Excellent,8,3,5,3.75,5,4.02,83404,4.0,"Man, I love Steinbeck. I love the simplicity of his characters and the humdrum feeling their lives evoke. I love the indigence of his settings and the candidness with which these characters accept their conditions. I love how quietly he frames his stories with comments on fatalism, while still revealing to us the potential for happiness that pushes at its surface, trying to elbow its way out. At its core, the Steinbeck novel want us to figure out how to embrace the cards life has dealt us. It knows that the sooner we do, the sooner that happiness can become ours for the taking. It might be a fatalistic coin we're being asked to pocket, but it's a coin on which has been embossed a seal of optimism. 
 But he certainly doesn't make it very easy. The characters in his books are so far down the economic ladder you need a pair of binoculars to find them. And when you do spot them, you discover they are haggling over nickels and frogs. You almost want to step in and give them a Lowe's gift card, just to make things a little easier for them. But Steinbeck characters don't need your damn Lowe's gift card. The point is not to move up that ladder; it's to find comfort with the rung you're already on. If they can recognize that, why can't you? 
 And that's the thing about Steinbeckian characters: they often possess a deeper level of knowledge and understanding than their financial statuses--or their grammar--would otherwise suggest. There are also usually one or two who stand out from the rest for their capacity to grasp and relay human need. Where Ma Joad was just such a character in The Grapes of Wrath, it is Doc who lays it to us straight in Cannery Row. 
 ""The things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second."" 
 Ruminating on the contradictory nature of being human, wherein one's needs are in direct competition with one's moral goals, Doc reminds us what's worth appreciating about Mack and his Flophouse friends. Sure, they manipulate a situation for an advantageous edge if they can, and sure their idea of a party would make Clarissa Dalloway scream in mortified horror, but when all is said and done, they are honest with their friends and true to themselves in their dealings, and that is what makes their lives--at least that part of it--worth emulating.

What fun! 
 This book was both more and less wonderful than I'd remembered. More because I'd forgotten just what a superb stylist Robbins is (see mid-read comments). His plots are intricate, his characters are rendered in wonderful detail, down to the distinctive vocal stylings. His ideas, though perhaps a smidge stale twenty-five years on, are still interesting and fun and clever and smart, intellectual, but not in a showy or pedantic way. Plus there's that anxiety you get when you're, oh, twenty or so pages from the end of a book, thinking There's no way he can pull it all together satisfactorily in so few pages! But he does! It's a tiny bit cheesy, maybe just a wee bit pat, but c'mon. He had an awful lot of balls in the air. 
 Less for a few reasons. I'd kindly blocked out the fact that everyone in a Tom Robbins novel sooner or later launches into a discourse that sounds exactly like Tom Robbins, which can get pretty annoying. Also, I forgot how letchy he can be. There's a lot of sex in this book - in fact, it's one of the four pillars of immortality - which is fine; it's just that the descriptions of it are often a bit much. (""Alma hiccupped the mushroom scent of his spurt,"" ex, not to mention lots of glistening, semen-encrusted thighs, and that sort of thing.) 
 The other thing, which isn't really bad or good, exactly, is that I think Tom Robbins is kind of a victim of himself. He's too much Tom Robbins sometimes. Too hippie-cliche; too cerebral-in-an-understandable-but-trippy-way; too specific with his characters, to the point where they become caricatures that are hard to take seriously; even, sadly, too over-the-top with his metaphors (""his knuckle began rapping at his eye patch like a mongoloid woodpecker drilling for worms in a poker chip""? Are you kidding?); just too... too much. 
 I guess taking a few years off between Robbinses allows one to forget these drawbacks just enough to come back to him fresh and be able to enjoy his shimmering originality again. 
 mid-read: It's not that I'd forgotten, exactly, but no one does metaphors like Tom Robbins. For example: The sky was a velvety black paw pressing on the snowy landscape with a feline delicacy, stars flying like sparks from its fur. Fuck, really?? 
 pre-read: Last night I made the most amaaazing beet salad. And this afternoon, as I was pondering a middle ground between all the new new new new things I've been reading and something (Proust) too, ah, weighty to take on vacation, I saw my little half-shelf of Tom Robbins.

 Another Roadside Attraction

Meet Ed Kennedy - underage cab driver, pathetic card palyer, and useless at romance. He lives in a shack, and he's hopelessly in love with his best friend, Audrey. His life is one of peaceful routine and incompetence, until he inadvertently stops a bank robbery. That's when the first Ace arrives...That's when Ed becomes the messenger.
Chosen to care, he makes his way through town helping and hurting (when necessary), until only one question remains. Who's behind Ed's mission?",Fiction,Excellent,6,3,12,5.833333333333333,4,4.09,352,4.0,"""Believe it or not-it takes a lot of love to hate you like this."" 
 This book isn't easy to digest. The plot is original, the protagonist is at the same time your everyday guy and quite unique, but the love interest totally failed to impress me and the love story is forced. While this is an emotional read, it somehow failed to evoke some genuine feeling. But I still like the book very much, it's weird. 
 The novel starts off with one of the best first chapters I have ever encountered - a bank robbery. Unfortunately, the book never reached that high mark of suspense again, but it was entertaining nonetheless. Ed is your average guy who lives in the relatively poor neighborhood and wastes his time. He has best friends, a bit complicated relationships with his mother, brother and sisters. Also, there is a girl that he's in love with and one very smelly dog. And then, one day, everything changes and he becomes the Messenger. Ed must figure out who is in a need of help and what he can do to touch their lives. He is sent out on various missions and is tested with playing cards that contain the messages he is supposed to deliver. As Ed incorporates himself into these strangers' lives, he learns to care for them deeply and ultimately discovers a message for them that will change their lives. His best friends friends are Marv (the most entertaining character in the book), Ritchie and Audrey (the girl he's in love with). His roommate is his 17 year old dog called Doorman. Ed gets the third card and I really wished for something new to happen. 
 Despite the amazing first chapter, the novel nonetheless had a slow start. The characters are fun and appealing and they still represent the average person you can meet on the street. It was a little repetitive for me at times though, as the narrator deciphered his cards and delivered his messages, but I loved the illustrative ways he described emotions. Please don't go into this book expecting it to be anything like The Book Thief. These two books are nothing alike and have completely different messages. It so hard to compare them, since they're so drastically different. 
 Ed is a taxi driver who has no real life goals and there is nothing distinctive about him. He lives in the same town where he grew up, hangs out playing cards with the same three friends and is the unsuccessful black sheep of the family. Relying on his intuition alone, Ed starts touching people's lives and and yet you don't doubt for a second that his simple deeds make him a better person. As we follow Ed throughout his journey, we see him grow emotionally as the assigments get harder and harder to fulfill. I liked his self-deprecating sense of humor, but the story isn't about him feeling sorry for himself, but instead it's about his growth. Seeing the confidence he gained with every delivered message was so satisfying. Ed is a peculiar guy and it isn't hard to empathize with him, but I hated how passive he really is. 
 ,,It's not a big thing, but I guess it's true - big things are often just small things that are noticed."" 
 It's always the thought that counts. 
 ,,I also fear that nothing really ends at the end. Things just keep going as long as memory can wield its ax, always finding a soft part in your mind to cut through and enter."" 
 Ed had such depressive thoughts at times, that I almost became melancholic myself. 
 ""Ed?"" Ritchie says later. We're still standing in the water. ""There's only one thing I want."" ""What's that, Ritchie?"" His answer is simple. ""To want."" 
 Ritchie's story was so consuming, it's literally my favorite part of the book. 
 The one relationship I hated was the romance. Audrey is my least favorite character in the story, she's almost completely bland and did nothing for the plot.

234,The Shell Seekers,Rosamunde Pilcher,1988,1987,"Set in London and Cornwall from World War II to the present, Rosamunde Pilcher tells the story of the Keeling family, and of the passions and heartbreak that have held them together for three generations. The family centers around Penelope, and it is her love, courage, and sense of values that determine the course of all their lives,
One of Penelope's most treasured possessions is The Shell Seekers, which her father painted and left her as a remembrance and a legacy. It is this painting that symbolizes to Penelope the ties between the generations. It is the link between the past, the present, and the future. But it is the fate of this painting that just may tear the family apart....
Rosamunde Pilcher's writing demonstrates a deep sensitivity to human frailties, desires, and joys. She weaves a story that bursts with emotion, so involving it is impossible to put down. The world she creates and opens up to you becomes a place you feel comfortable, a place you can't wait to return to, a place you will never forget.",Fiction,Excellent,47,6,15,10.340425531914894,11,4.13,219,5.0,"""The most ordinary of prospects caused her to stop and stare. The last of the leaves dropped from the trees, and the bare branches made lace against pale skies. Sun after rain turned cobbled streets blue as fish scales, dazzling to the eye. Autumn winds, whipping the bay to a scud of white-caps, brought with them, not cold, but a surging sense of vitality..."" 
 Penelope Keeling knows how to live life to the fullest and I absolutely adore her! She grasps those things that matter most in life - the comfort of a home, the security of a loving mother, the laughter of friends and family, the feel of soil and the beauty of the outdoors, the enticing smells of home-cooked meals, and the allure of a splendid painting. When I come across a character in one of my books that touches me and makes me want to re-examine my own life, then I know I have found a gem. 
 Of course, we're all familiar with the phrase ""don't judge a book by its cover"". Unfortunately, I have been guilty of that offense in the past and no less so with this book. I have seen Rosamunde Pilcher's novels in bookstores and libraries and have admittedly walked right on by due to their overly feminine and botanic covers. I didn't think they were ""my sort of book"". However, I decided to give this one a try when I discovered some trusted Goodreads friends were reading this. Well, thank goodness I did - such a true delight! At the outset, we learn that Penelope is a sixty-four-year old widow that has had a surprise glimpse at her own mortality. We are introduced to her three adult children - Nancy, Olivia and Noel - as well as others that have touched her life at some point or another - her treasured mother and father, an ill-suited husband, a loyal friend, a devoted lover, a grieving young woman and a secretive yet trustworthy gardener. Each character is drawn with such depth and clarity that I felt I really knew each and every one of them. The title of this novel, The Shell Seekers, derives from a painting given to Penelope by her father, the prominent artist Lawrence Stern. When the now deceased Lawrence Stern's works of art become much sought-after, the value of this and other pieces increases significantly. Each of Penelope's children have their own thoughts about what should be done with this and other works in their mother's possession. What they desire reveals to us much about each of them, their innermost substance. As with real people, what we see is not all pretty. Pilcher has the gift of depicting riveting family dynamics. ""Family rows are like car accidents. Every family thinks, 'It couldn't happen to us,' but it can happen to everybody. The only way to avoid them is to drive with the greatest care and have much consideration for others."" 
 Penelope makes a journey to Cornwall, both in spirit and literally, where she sweeps us along to revel in the landscape and her own cherished memories. I loved every minute of this visit and will miss my time spent with Penelope. Heart-warming, memorable, and a bit of a tear-jerker, The Shell Seekers is a treasure I won't soon forget. I am quite pleased that several more Rosamunde Pilcher novels now grace my bookshelf with their blossoming covers and their promise of comfort and pure reading satisfaction.",135.0,1,35424,176765.76,4.99,811,5,3,2

A lot of it is valid, but there are certain times that he's the perfect author to be reading. Like last night when a winter storm blew through. Freezing temperatures, snow, ice, and high winds made it look like an Artic wasteland outside. As I lay reading under my warm blankets, I paused for a moment and listened to the wind making the house creak and the sleet hitting the windows, and thought, ""This is just about the perfect setting to be reading a Stephen King book."" The fact that it was a very damn good Stephen King book was an excellent bonus. 
 As if to give us a break after recent high page count books like Under the Dome and Duma Key, King delivers four short-n-sweet novellas focusing on the nastier sides of people with just a hint of the supernatural. These are four tales about the lives we build that we tell ourselves our safe, sane and secure, but there's always darkness lurking at the edges. King points out that sometimes we're the ones who invite that darkness in. 
 In 1922, a Depression-era farmer in the Midwest just wants to work with his son and read books in the evening, but his wife wants to sell some land her father left her to a hog factory and use the money to move to the city. When the two can't reach an agreement, the farmer decides to murder her and hide the body in an old well. Even worse, he manipulates his son into helping. What results is a chilling story of the unintended consequences that one crime and the ensuing guilt can cause. 
 Big Driver features Tess, an author who writes cozy mysteries about a group of elderly amateur female detectives that are popular with grandma-types. Taking a short cut home from a speaking/signing engagement, a flat tire leads to Tess being raped and left for dead. After escaping, Tess realizes that since she's a quasi-celebrity going to the police would result in a media firestorm that would taint the rest of her life so she decides to seek her own revenge. 
 Dave Streeter is a man with terminal cancer who gets a mysterious offer for fifteen more healthy years of life in Fair Extension, but he has to nominate someone to get a heaping dose of bad luck in his place. Since he's got a lot of resentment and grudges against his best friend Tom and his perfect life, Streeter decides that his old buddy deserves some misfortune. 
 The question in A Good Marriage is how well do you know your spouse? Darcy and Bob have been together 25 years and if things are a bit dull and ordinary at this point, they've built a good life and are generally content. When Bob's away on business, Darcy goes looking for batteries in the garage and discovers a horrifying secret that her husband has been keeping. 
 This is some of the best stuff that King has done in years. By focusing on human nature rather than supernatural monsters, he was able to create some very relatable yet scary stories. We know that we won't really be trapped in old hotels filled with ghosts or live in a town overrun by vampires or chased by demon cars that drive themselves. But getting a flat tire on a lonely road? Finding a dark secret about a spouse? Being jealous of a friend doing better than yourself? Watching your life unravel because of a bad decision you've tried to hide? Those are things that we really fear, and King uses them all skillfully to deliver some of his creepiest stories yet.",118.0,1,107,640.9300000000001,5.99,1236,1,4,1
236,The Chosen,J. R. Ward,2017,2010,"Love or duty -- which would you choose? Prince Severin has been brought up to put duty before all else. Now, his duty is to marry and produce an heir. He has his choice of princesses. Unfortunately, his passion is for princes. Havyn has been a slave all his life. When his powers are discovered, he finds himself purchased and freed by a Prince and apprenticed to the royal wizard, Ildar. His duty is to stay chaste to keep his powers strong. Unfortunately, his passion is for Severin. With kingdoms at war, the throne hanging in the balance, and magic in the air, can the two men find happiness together, or is duty more important than love?",Fiction,Excellent,1,3,10,4.425,6,3.21,31,3.0,"The Chosen is a classic fantasy novel but without the epic length. Included are long journeys, prophesies, royalty, magic, oracles, wars at stake, forbidden love, runaway elopements, long lost princes, lengthy quests, true love, and a happy ending. Because the story stays pretty true to the fantasy origins, there is not originality offered but for those fans of the genre, the familiar themes are always welcome. The writing makes the story incredibly easy and fast to read so that kept my interest whereas if the pace had dragged I would have been bored. The characters are again right out of fantasy lore so nothing surprising but they are warm and likable. As a first novel, this is a decent fantasy offering that may be of interest to classic fantasy tales. 
 Severin is a prince out on a journey with his faithful wizard Ildar to find himself after a lifetime of being spoiled at his parent's whim. Severin buys Havyn at a slave auction, intending to free the man once they return to his home. Along the way, they discover Havyn has magical ability and Ildar quickly makes the ex-slave his new wizard's apprentice. Life isn't easy once they reach home though as Severin is set to wed the niece of a neighboring land, yet his chemistry with Havyn causes havoc for both. When the royal family and entourage set out for the betrothal ceremony, there is no end of problems. Murder, intrigue, runaways, long lost royalty, quests, true love, and a happy ending are all involved as the various characters find their way in this realm of magic and mystery. 
 There is a lot going on in this story but surprisingly, the plot never feels overwhelmed or too fast. Each issue brought up is well handled and builds upon the next so each piece is simply part of a bigger, more complicated whole. Some of the elements are pretty predictable and the story on the whole isn't wildly original. Often the plot feels obvious as the fantasy themes used are easy to identify so there is not a lot of suspense or wonder associated with reading. Yet the writing keeps the pace quick and characters interesting enough that even those who have read this type of story all the time will keep turning the page here. 
 Part of this is that the characters are pretty decent. Severin and Havyn narrate the story in alternating third person point of view and for the most part they stay well within the predictable roles. Havyn is slightly over the top with the orphan childhood sold into slavery from birth and never known a bath, clothing, food, or kindness. However this exaggeration is pretty typical of everyone in the book. All the characters seem to exist on the extremes of their description and supposedly almost all are virgins, which is necessary to fill their various roles. This is a bit of a stretch especially at the end when several of these mandates are flipped to provide a happy ending, but it didn't really bother me since it was clearly coming. 
 The various characters have a bit of charm, a bit of scheming, and some interest which kept me reading even though I knew what would happen - usually a sign I give up and become bored. Yet again, there's an ease to the writing that lets you enjoy the classic tale even if there is nothing surprising. The common themes are well loved for a reason and even though just about all used here, it pretty much works. This isn't a book that leaves you breathless but it is one you enjoy while reading.

243,The Tommyknockers,Stephen King,1987,2010,"Something was happening in Bobbi Anderson's idyllic small town of Haven, Maine. Something that gave every man, woman, and child in town powers far beyond ordinary mortals. Something that turned the town into a death trap for all outsiders. Something that came from a metal object, buried for millennia, that Bobbi stumbled across. It wasn't that Bobbi and the other good folks of Haven had sold their souls to reap the rewards of the most deadly evil this side of hell. It was more like a diabolical takeover...an invasion of body and soul--and mind.
(c)2010 Blackstone Audio",Fiction,Famous,23,1,14,3.9565217391304346,8,3.48,12,5.0,"Late last night and the night before, 
 Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers, knocking at the door. 
 While walking through the wooded acreage of her Haven, Maine home, novelist Bobbie Anderson stumbled across something very interesting. Literally. After picking herself up off the ground, Bobbie looked back to see a thin piece of metal jutting out of the soil. Letting her curiosity get the best of her, Bobbie began to dig, in spite of the strenuous protests of her faithful dog, Pete. Bobbie doesn't know it yet, but she is about to unearth something never before seen on this world. Let's hope the world survives it. 
 Bobbie's best friend, Jim Gardner, was in the next state when Bobbie made her big find, but he began to get the nagging feeling that she was in trouble. Having fallen on some hard times himself, Jim decided it was time to return to Maine. He arrived, some two weeks after Bobbie's discovery, to find that his friend, and her familiar old house, had undergone some big changes. Bobbie, a lithe woman before, was now almost grotesquely thin and on the verge of collapse. Also, Bobbie was never very handy, but Gardner finds that she has rigged up her old water heater with some kind of new power source that is like nothing he has ever seen, her old typewriter hacks out novels while she sleeps, and her old farm tractor has a new gear that reads ""up."" 
 Unbeknownst to Jim, there are strange things going on all over Haven. Spreading out from Bobbie's house, in an ever-widening radius, people have begun to change. They know things about each other now, deep, dark secrets that have never been discussed out loud. And it seems like everyone in town is inventing gadgets that defy the laws of science. Well, earthly science anyway, and they all use power sources, tangles of wire and D-cell batteries, just like the one in Bobbie's water heater. 
 As days turn into weeks, the townsfolk of Haven resemble human beings less and less, and their collective mind powers grow stronger. Gardner has been immune to the effects so far; he believes the metal plate in his head may be the reason for this. Jim knows he must get out and tell someone what is happening in Haven, but he also knows that he is only safe as long as he is helping Bobbie dig. Time grows ever shorter as more and more of the artifact is uncovered, and Gardner has no idea what to do about it. 
 On the surface, 
 The Tommyknockers 
 is a pretty good science fiction tale, and pretty creepy too. A whole town full of people slowly turning into something alien, ""becoming,"" as they say in Haven, while a few regular folks are caught in their midst, forced to play along. In that regard, this story reminds me a little of Jack Finney's Invasion of the Body Snatchers. 
 Dig a little deeper, however, and you'll find something that's a little more down to Earth, although no less terrifying. There are all kinds of horrors in the world; sometimes they lurk beneath the surface of the Earth, and sometimes they lurk beneath the surface of a human being. Both of King's main characters, Bobbie and Gard, have terrors hidden within them. For Bobbie, it's an over-bearing sister who wants to run her life. For Gard, it's the bottle. 
 Stephen King spent five years writing 
 The Tommyknockers 
 , an unusually long time for one book. In his foreword, which is included in this audiobook, King says ""this book was not so much written as gutted out."" The sentiment mirrors the overall theme of the book itself: demons must be exorcised, sometimes forcibly, like a rotted tooth. This coming from a man who has fought a few personal demons in his own life. Jim Gardner eventually comes to the realization that in order to save Haven, the artifact must be dug out and removed, just as his own demon must be removed, and that of his friend Bobbie, for them to be whole again. 
 Just as with authors, narrators can sometimes grab me right away, and sometimes they take a little while to grow on me. Edward Herrmann was of the latter variety: I was dubious at first, but over time I began to appreciate his style. He doesn't really do voices very well, but he has a relaxed style that feels very natural. Hermann is widely known for his role as Richard Gilmore on The Gilmore Girls, and as Max the head vampire in the film The Lost Boys. He has also done voice work for The History Channel, PBS, and a lengthy television ad campaign for Dodge throughout the 1990's. 
 Yes, Stephen King knows about personal demons, and I can see where 
 The Tommyknockers 
 might have been difficult for him to write, but I'm glad he did. This is one of my favorite King books.

On her way back to the airport, she meets two people who got stuck in a river crossing. They are on the same plane when it crashes. Later, she finds that the plane was sabotaged. She is so emotional involved with the pilot and other passenger who died in the crash that she looks into the reasons why it happened. 
 The first suspect is Ronnie Chen, who was scheduled to be on the plane but never showed up. However, Ronnie is found murdered. 
 Another man on the plane is Lee Denham, supposidly, a person who smuggled Chinese people into Australia. He's a former police officer who is supposed to have gotten his partner killed. Now he is looking for Jon Ming, a scientist who left China with a valuable formula. The Chens are also looking for Ming. They think Georgia knows where he is and they torture her, cutting off her finger, in attempt to gain information. They want to bring Ming and his formula back to China. 
 Georgia is a fun character to read about. She knows no fear and gets into many predicuments, always managing to escape by the narrowest manner. However, after getting her finger cut off, she continued to fight as if nothing happened and this was difficult to believe. 
 The plot develops in a logical manner and we share with Georgia, the search for Ming and the attempted evasion of the Chen's. As the story progresses, the author describes the Australian countryside in a most picturesque manner.

It was Christmas and I was in that weird mood I always get in during the once a year visit to my biological dad's house. He'd asked my mom what I was into lately and produced a large box of books, all by Stephen King. The book had me at ""Late last night and the night before..."" 
 It took me a while to pin point just why this book knocked it out of the park for me. It is a massive tome and filled with King's classic, meandering plot lines. It wasn't new ground either. Small town, special attention to writers,growing evil born from deep dark secrets,Maine. The whole checklist but that didn't detract for me, like it would for later King books. No, I was sucked in for two reasons. 
 -I'm a sucker for anything out of this world, toss in a UFO and I'm on your hook 
 -I really connected with the characters 
 That second one in a big way. A lot of King's stories have someone you can identify with but ""The Tommyknockers"" really had some winners. I especially found the turmoil Hilly had over what happened to his brother Davey easy to find a common thread with. 
 So to sum things up I highly recommend this book if you like Stephen King, spiced up with a bit of Science Fiction.",0.0,0,50760,304052.4,5.99,693,5,5,5

Everything, including the speech, mannerisms and military styles of the kingdoms is meticulously described and self consistent. The world is rich in detail - I especially love the way that the destructive high-storms have shaped the people of Roshar such that 'storm' is an expletive used instead of the F word. The wonderful world building is backed up by an amazing plot line. 
 The first half of the novel, while great, is used to set up the story for ten novels. This makes it sometimes information heavy - but Sanderson has used maps, illustrations and quotes in his unique way to make the history of Roshar interesting and relevant to the reader. Many questions have been raised in the first half, and while most are answered in the second half, the book finishes with so many new mysteries that I feel I can't wait 12 months for the sequel. 
 The Way of Kings is written in three parts, with interludes from other characters in between. There seem to be ten narrating characters in total, which leads me to conclude that perhaps each of the ten books will focus primarily on the journey of one of them, as The Way of Kings focuses on Kaladin. The growth of the characters was my favourite part of the book. Kaladin's apathy and self pity and Shallan's constant bemoaning of her fate really annoyed me initially. But as they grew and found themselves, I quickly decided they were my favourite characters.

On her way back to the airport, she meets two people who got stuck in a river crossing. They are on the same plane when it crashes. Later, she finds that the plane was sabotaged. She is so emotional involved with the pilot and other passenger who died in the crash that she looks into the reasons why it happened. 
 The first suspect is Ronnie Chen, who was scheduled to be on the plane but never showed up. However, Ronnie is found murdered. 
 Another man on the plane is Lee Denham, supposidly, a person who smuggled Chinese people into Australia. He's a former police officer who is supposed to have gotten his partner killed. Now he is looking for Jon Ming, a scientist who left China with a valuable formula. The Chens are also looking for Ming. They think Georgia knows where he is and they torture her, cutting off her finger, in attempt to gain information. They want to bring Ming and his formula back to China. 
 Georgia is a fun character to read about. She knows no fear and gets into many predicuments, always managing to escape by the narrowest manner. However, after getting her finger cut off, she continued to fight as if nothing happened and this was difficult to believe. 
 The plot develops in a logical manner and we share with Georgia, the search for Ming and the attempted evasion of the Chen's. As the story progresses, the author describes the Australian countryside in a most picturesque manner.

He had hoped that his last confrontation with them would be the end of it, but the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. The time is coming when he will again have to dance with the Snakes and the Foxes, playing a game that cannot be won.

274,White Night,Jim Butcher,2007,2013,"It was a wonderful night, such a night as is only possible when we are young, dear reader. The sky was so starry, so bright that, looking at it, one could not help asking oneself whether ill-humoured and capricious people could live under such a sky. That is a youthful question too, dear reader, very youthful, but may the Lord put it more frequently into your heart!... Speaking of capricious and ill-humoured people, I cannot help recalling my moral condition all that day. From early morning I had been oppressed by a strange despondency. It suddenly seemed to me that I was lonely, that every one was forsaking me and going away from me. Of course, any one is entitled to ask who ""every one"" was.",Fiction,Famous,4,5,16,9.75,11,4.05,1351,5.0,"""May your sky be clear, may your sweet smile be bright and untroubled, and may you be blessed for that moment of blissful happiness which you gave to another, lonely and grateful heart!"" 
 Let me tell you something, no one can express feelings and emotions so deeply and perfectly like my dear, precious, and all-time favorite writer: Fyodor Dostoyevsky! 
 I don't know why my hands keep shaking when I read his novels! It's really weird! I feel like he's controlling me! possessing my soul!!! 
 I fell in love with this story right from the start! It's not just a love story, it's more like a C'est-La-Vie story!! It simply tells you ... ""That's life, ma friend!!"". 
 In life, you'll fly high in the sky, and you'll drown down in tears! Love will both hurt and delight you! 
 In the last line, Dostoyevsky wonders: 
 ""My God, a whole moment of happiness! Is that too little for the whole of a man's life?""

275,The Way Of Kings,Brandon Sanderson,2010,2010,"Speak again the ancient oaths,
Life before death.
Strength before weakness.
Journey before Destination.
And return to men the Shards they once bore.
The Knights Radiant must stand again.
Roshar is a world of stone swept by tempests that shape ecology and civilization. Animals and plants retract; cities are built in shelter. In centuries since ten orders of Knights fell, their Shardblade swords and Shardplate armor still transform men into near-invincible warriors. Wars are fought for them, and won by them.
In one such war on the ruined Shattered Plains, slave Kaladin struggles to save his men and fathom leaders who deem them expendable, in senseless wars where ten armies fight separately against one foe.
Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Fascinated by the ancient text namedThe Way of Kingsand troubled by visions of ancient times, he doubts his sanity.
Across the ocean, Shallan trains under eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece Jasnah. Though Shallan genuinely loves learning, she plans a daring theft. Her research hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.",Fiction,Famous,2,7,11,9.0,5,4.64,77,5.0,"It has been quite a while since I read and reviewed an adult epic fantasy - and I believe I'm come a fair way since then - so excuse me a moment of nostalgia before I begin. *deep breath in, deep breath out* Okay good. So first of all, many of you reading this will be thinking ""1,001 pages?! Sod that!!"" but wait. Don't be put off by the size. Though it takes you a little while longer than usual to read The Way of Kings, as can be said for a lot of epic fantasy to be honest, you honestly won't notice the time passing because you're enjoying the book so much. Yep. That good. 
 So, okay.. I'll admit that not very much happened in The Way of Kings yet somehow it doesn't drag. This is book 1 in a planned-to-be 10 volume series called the Stormlight Archive and as such, you can expect that it is the build up book. It is full of glorious world building, the introduction of characters that you'll fall in love with (I'll come to them in a moment), and a magic system that left me floored by the end, but not a whole lot of story-moving action. Saying that, it's the best not-very-much-happens book I've ever read and I heartily recommend it to all fans of fantasy fiction because of the very easy style of writing Brandon Sanderson uses. You find yourself caught up in the flow of words and before you know it - oh my, is that the time?! Better get some sleep.. Okay so I wasn't so fond of the flashback chapters but overall, the story they told was detrimental to Kaladin's character building. They told us about his past and how he became the man he is. 
 As for the story, well.. a world of storms beset by wars ruled by High Princes who care nothing but for their own personal gain while a young man tries to overcome those who have wronged him? It sounds good but it's not exactly eye catching at first glance. I can assure you that the wonder of this story is more than that. Its uniqueness comes from its world building, and the story itself is building to something truly massive. There were moments reading The Way of Kings that gave me chills and had me jumping up and down in excitement and it is official now, I'd thought it after reading the Mistborn trilogy, but now I'm certain: Brandon Sanderson is the God of fantasy book endings. It is worth reading his books for the endings alone and I am entirely jealous of those of you who have yet to experience them for the first time! 
 The characters are wonderful and flawed. Kaladin contains the most build and exploration of any of the characters with his own flashback chapters and self discovery, plus a hefty amount of the chapters being dedicated to him. He is a fantastic character who you want to see win in the end, but he also goes through fits of despair when he feels he is doomed to fail his bridge members and occasionally the ""woe is me"" mentally can get a little old. However, through those parts are these fabulous side characters. Syl the spren who follows Kaladin around, Teft the older guy who turns out to be the most trustworthy of them all, Rock the Horneater who has the biggest heart and made me laugh whether he meant to or not, I don't know, but it was a nice bit of comic relief amongst the depression. 
 We also follow the perspective of Shallan, ward to Jasnah who is sister of the King and a so-called heretic. She was another of my favourites. She's smart and willful and duly takes care of herself. Shallan comes from a family who I very much despise, a family purely out for their own personal gain but Shallan is a little light within them. Though she is sent to steal Jasnah's fabrial, a priceless piece of jewellery which allows the user to use magic known as 'Soulcasting', she finds herself falling in love with this world of research and education and she is as smart as Jasnah. These characters are the closest we come in Roshar1 to strong female characters. Thanks this world's theology, women in Roshar are repressed. Women are the writers, the artists, focusing on the creative arts where men focus on the fighting and the heavy lifting. It works well as a way to show us Roshar's culture, but I am very much hoping to see women bare their hands (currently they must cover their ""safehand"" in a sleeve or glove in public) and sit at the men's tables at dinner later in the series as it hasn't always been this way. 
 Dalinar, brother to the murdered King and uncle to the current sovereign, and Adolin, his son, deserve a mention too. Dalinar is one of the High Princes at war on the Shattered Plains fighting against the frightening Parshendi army, and the only one we really find ourselves respecting. He experiences dreams, or more likely flashbacks to a forgotten time, during Highstorms and people around him believe him to be losing his mind. Adolin was supposedly given a viewpoint to showcase Dalinar a little more clearly and I'm very glad he exists in this way because it gives us a chance to see what's really happening with Dalinar without the worries of a potentially 'unreliable narrator' and the other High Princes. 
 Altogether, we get the viewpoints of royalty and nobility, women, and a slave-turned-Bridgeman, seemingly somebody unimportant. This gives such a well rounded view of the story that it leaves no page unturned. If I had even half of Brandon Sanderson's talent and imagination, I'd be a very lucky little writer-type indeed. 
 Highprince of War, book 2 of the series, is currently being written and it is hoped that it might be released later this year. I really cannot wait! The Way of Kings made its way onto my list of favourite books within about 10 minutes of reading and if you like fantasy and haven't given it a go yet, you're missing out on something great. 
 Oh, and one last thing? I recommend you buy/borrow parts 1 and 2 rather than the whole book in one, unless reading an ebook, because this book is way too heavy to carry around, and you're going to want to.",6.0,1,2200,2178.0,0.99,32,2,2,4

But the Society he faithfully served was built on lies. Darrow's kind have been betrayed and denied by their elitist masters, the Golds--and their only path to liberation is revolution. And so Darrow sacrifices himself in the name of the greater good for which Eo, his true love and inspiration, laid down her own life. He becomes a Gold, infiltrating their privileged realm so that he can destroy it from within.
A lamb among wolves in a cruel world, Darrow finds friendship, respect, and even love--but also the wrath of powerful rivals. To wage and win the war that will change humankind's destiny, Darrow must confront the treachery arrayed against him, overcome his all-too-human desire for retribution--and strive not for violent revolt but a hopeful rebirth. Though the road ahead is fraught with danger and deceit, Darrow must choose to follow Eo's principles of love and justice to free his people.

 Okay, lets move on to a little bit of a more sedate review. First off I love Sevro, Ragnar and Mustang and I swear . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
 I can't even write this review! This book is all over the place with everything! 
 Blowing people up in space, bloody battles, stupidity, more people being blown up here and there and everywhere! People you like getting killed. People you don't like that you want to beat into the ground! 
 Let me just add some random excerpts that have to do with Darrow and Sevro and stuff! 
 I explode through the bridge like a ball of lead shot into a store of china and glass. I crash into displays and strategy desks before blasting through the reinforced metal of the bridge walls, through the steel of the hallways till at last I slam bodily into a bulkhead a hundred meters through and past the bridge. Dazed. Can't find Sevro. I call him over the com. He groans something about his ass. Maybe he did shit himself. 
 Okay, so here is a moment that Darrow and Sevro had together after finding out a revelation. It brought a tear to my eye for reasons, there's always reasons people. Well, the tear to my eye came after the first part and some stuff and then the other stuff =D 
 Sevro spits in my face, right under the eye. ""Guess wrong again and I leave you like this."" He snaps his fingers. ""I will not come back. I will not help you. I will not bleed for you. I will not sacrifice my friends for a man who doesn't give enough of a shit about me to put his neck out just once. Trust goes both ways, Darrow. This time you have to take a leap."" 
 shfosehgsoihgsiodhfsidfhsifh some stuff and. . . 
 He can't say any more because I'm hugging him and crying. I sob and hold on to him, shaking, scaring him. He doesn't move except to pat me on the head. All the weight falls from my shoulders. Someone knows. He knows and he's here. He knows and he came to help me. To help me. I can't stop shaking and saying thank you. Eo was right. I was right. ""You are my friend,"" I tremble out like a child. It almost makes him cry seeing me this way. 
 I'm done here people, I can't after that part again! On to Morning Star! =)

281,Words Of Radiance,Brandon Sanderson,2014,2017,"From #1 New York Timesbestselling author Brandon Sanderson, Words of Radiance, Book Two of the Stormlight Archive, continues the immersive fantasy epic that The Way of Kingsbegan.
Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status ""darkeyes."" Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.
The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin's master has much deeper motives.
Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.
Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable.

282,White Night,Jim Butcher,2007,2013,"It was a wonderful night, such a night as is only possible when we are young, dear reader. The sky was so starry, so bright that, looking at it, one could not help asking oneself whether ill-humoured and capricious people could live under such a sky. That is a youthful question too, dear reader, very youthful, but may the Lord put it more frequently into your heart!... Speaking of capricious and ill-humoured people, I cannot help recalling my moral condition all that day. From early morning I had been oppressed by a strange despondency. It suddenly seemed to me that I was lonely, that every one was forsaking me and going away from me. Of course, any one is entitled to ask who ""every one"" was.",Fiction,Famous,4,5,16,9.75,11,4.05,1351,5.0,"""May your sky be clear, may your sweet smile be bright and untroubled, and may you be blessed for that moment of blissful happiness which you gave to another, lonely and grateful heart!"" 
 Let me tell you something, no one can express feelings and emotions so deeply and perfectly like my dear, precious, and all-time favorite writer: Fyodor Dostoyevsky! 
 I don't know why my hands keep shaking when I read his novels! It's really weird! I feel like he's controlling me! possessing my soul!!! 
 I fell in love with this story right from the start! It's not just a love story, it's more like a C'est-La-Vie story!! It simply tells you ... ""That's life, ma friend!!"". 
 In life, you'll fly high in the sky, and you'll drown down in tears! Love will both hurt and delight you! 
 In the last line, Dostoyevsky wonders: 
 ""My God, a whole moment of happiness! Is that too little for the whole of a man's life?"" 
 Just one moment of real happiness! That's all we need!",25.0,1,2862,2833.38,0.99,1009,3,2,2

That was the last one I wrote before I cleaned up my act. And I've thought about it a lot lately and said to myself, ""There's really a good book in here, underneath all the sort of spurious energy that cocaine provides, and I ought to go back."" The book is about 700 pages long, and I'm thinking, ""There's probably a good 350-page novel in there."" 
 -	Stephen King in a Rolling Stone interview. 
 You got that right, Uncle Stevie. 
 Bobbi Anderson is a writer living outside a small Maine town who trips over a hunk of metal sticking out of the ground while walking in the woods with her dog. She finds herself strangely compelled to dig it up, and she soon realizes that she's stumbled across a flying saucer that has been buried for thousands of years. 
 Bobbi's friend Jim Gardner is a poet with a love of booze and a deep hatred of nuclear power. After going on an epic bender Gardner visits Bobbi and finds that she has worked herself ragged and lost several teeth while digging up the ship. She's also started making all sorts of home improvements like fixing her aging water heater up with what appears to be a fusion reactor. Bobbi convinces Gardner that they need to excavate the ship themselves, and he agrees to help. But the ship's influence grows as it is unearthed to the point where the nearby townsfolk also start spitting teeth and coming up with clever ideas of their own. 
 The King quote I led with really sums up this book. There's an intriguing idea at the heart of it and some nice character stuff particularly when it comes to Gardner. However, its coke-fueled writing is so evident that you expect to see leftover powder and dried blood spots from King's nose on every page. There's just too many tangents that go in useless directions, and it really gets out of control when he starts telling all the stories happening in the nearby town of Haven. 
 Detailing the takeover of the population of a small town via snapshots of the locals is something King does well in other books like Salem's Lot, but he could never draw the line here between relevant character details and useless information. In fact, it almost seems at times like he was starting different novels. One has a beloved civic leader coming to suspect that there is something very wrong happening and doing her best to hold out from it. Another has a reporter starting to unravel the mystery of what happens in Haven, but since all he is doing is uncovering what we already know his whole thread is pretty much useless anyhow so learning all about his relationship with his passive aggressive mother is especially pointless. 
 King also has problems in dealing with things logically from a plot standpoint. He prefers vague supernatural threats that he can routinely increase or reduce the powers of as needed, but when he has to put physical rules to them things fly apart. Here he can't even nail down exactly how the Tommyknockers are transforming the people. It's definitely a gas that seems to come off the skin of the ship as it's exposed. That's a good concept (Although why aliens would coat the outside of their ship with something that would spread on contact with Earth air is a valid question.) but the ship also exudes something akin to electromagnetism that effects electronics and radio waves. 
 You could make the argument that there's no reason it can't be pumping out both gas and some weird alien radiation. Which is true, but it gets messy when it comes exactly which thing is doing what, and King practically broke his back trying to draw parallels to the TK ship and nuclear reactors so that theme is clear. However, Gardner is immune to the Tommyknocker transformation because he has a metal plate in his head so that seems to indicate that it isn't caused by the gas, but it is repeatedly shown that others can avoid its effects by not breathing the air. It just isn't consistent at all. There is also a whopper of a continuity error right at the heart of this that shows that King wasn't thinking through the details. A huge deal is made out of how the sling that lowers Gardner and Bobbi into the excavation pit requires one person to be up top to operate it, and that element plays a pivotal part in the climax. Yet at the moment when they reach the hatch both of them are down in the hole at the same time with no one else around. Oops 
 He also didn't think through the implications of including the usual Easter eggs to his other works. The town of Derry exists here along with a direct reference to IT as well as other books, and that seems harmless enough at first. However, the end of this one would literally be the biggest story in human history. So that means the Stephen King universe should include it and the aftermath, but it doesn't. Yeah, yeah, I know. The Dark Tower has many levels, blah, blah, blah. You can believe that if you want, but it increasingly feels to me that the references aren't so much clever winks to reader as they are lazy tricks that undermine the story King is trying to tell at the moment. 
 Plus, Stephen King just plain sucks at writing about aliens. He proved it again in Dreamcatcher, and if you read that whole interview I linked to you'll see that he also doesn't like that one much either and blames the Oxycontin he was on following being struck by a car. So that's two bad books about evil aliens he wrote under the influence. I'm sensing a trend here. 
 Aside from the drugs though there's an element of King's personal outlook that makes him trying to do an alien invasion story problematic. Like a lot of Baby Boomers he has a general distrust of the guvment, and Uncle Stevie's distaste is so strong that he just can't imagine them doing the right thing. He also has some anti-tech tendencies and doesn't think much of science. (The Stand is a prime example of this.) So the aliens are evil, but he also doesn't think you could trust anyone in authority or with scientific expertise to do anything about them. That's when King's anti-establishment nature is at war with his own plot. It's like his alien stories are trying to be both E.T. and The Thing at the same time, and it just doesn't work like that. 
 For example, we get a long conversation when Bobbi (Who is part-Tommyknocker at this point.) is trying to convince Gardner that they can't call 'the Dallas police', and that's a big point that wins him over because he's an anti-nuke protestor who doesn't trust the powers that be with an alien ship. So that means that an alien influenced western writer and a drunken poet who shot his own wife are supposed to be the ones we trust to deal with the discovery of aliens? And yeah, I get that this is a con job to get Gardner to help dig up the ship, but that thread of thinking that the Feds would somehow be even worse than murderous aliens runs through this and Dreamcatcher in defiance of internal plot logic. 
 I mean, do we really believe that some idiot would be so distrustful of government agencies and science as well as have such a strong belief in crazy conspiracy theories that he would shun the system and instead choose to side with a hideous monster in human form who is telling him nothing but lies?

286,Words Of Radiance,Brandon Sanderson,2014,2017,"From #1 New York Timesbestselling author Brandon Sanderson, Words of Radiance, Book Two of the Stormlight Archive, continues the immersive fantasy epic that The Way of Kingsbegan.
Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status ""darkeyes."" Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.
The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin's master has much deeper motives.
Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.
Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable.

 I'm gonna be a little spoilery. :) 
 Why? The re-read was actually rather satisfying. Yes, it's a novel about survival and all the kinds of crap that men make women do to satisfy themselves, but it's also a rather moving novel about keeping (or losing) one's sanity in the face of all those expectations. 
 Never mind the sheer horror of being handcuffed to a bed without hope of being saved because your lover just keeled over, or watching a dog eat your husband as you go thirsty. It's a lot more than just that. It's memories and other humiliations and the struggle to find oneself through one hell of an ordeal. 
 Plus, I kinda like the fact that we're dealing with a very Poe-ish or Aristotelian art-ethic here. It's very focused in time and place, forcing us to go down deep into the subconscious. I can't help but appreciate that more now than when I was younger. *shrug* 
 Either way, I also enjoyed the almost tacked-on feel of the extended denouement. It really gave a sense of reflection and of shoring up her defenses after having them all stripped away, both literally and figuratively. I felt the power of the positive reversal. 
 Now, I should say that I'm revising this from my three stars to four based mainly on the fact that the novel is good on its own, but when I chose to give it three (from memory), I did so based on my enjoyment in comparison with the rest of Stephen King's works. It isn't his strongest novel by far, but it was still quite enjoyable.

Her research hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.",Fiction,Famous,2,7,11,9.0,5,4.64,77,5.0,"It has been quite a while since I read and reviewed an adult epic fantasy - and I believe I'm come a fair way since then - so excuse me a moment of nostalgia before I begin. *deep breath in, deep breath out* Okay good. So first of all, many of you reading this will be thinking ""1,001 pages?! Sod that!!"" but wait. Don't be put off by the size. Though it takes you a little while longer than usual to read The Way of Kings, as can be said for a lot of epic fantasy to be honest, you honestly won't notice the time passing because you're enjoying the book so much. Yep. That good. 
 So, okay.. I'll admit that not very much happened in The Way of Kings yet somehow it doesn't drag. This is book 1 in a planned-to-be 10 volume series called the Stormlight Archive and as such, you can expect that it is the build up book. It is full of glorious world building, the introduction of characters that you'll fall in love with (I'll come to them in a moment), and a magic system that left me floored by the end, but not a whole lot of story-moving action. Saying that, it's the best not-very-much-happens book I've ever read and I heartily recommend it to all fans of fantasy fiction because of the very easy style of writing Brandon Sanderson uses. You find yourself caught up in the flow of words and before you know it - oh my, is that the time?! Better get some sleep.. Okay so I wasn't so fond of the flashback chapters but overall, the story they told was detrimental to Kaladin's character building. They told us about his past and how he became the man he is. 
 As for the story, well.. a world of storms beset by wars ruled by High Princes who care nothing but for their own personal gain while a young man tries to overcome those who have wronged him? It sounds good but it's not exactly eye catching at first glance. I can assure you that the wonder of this story is more than that. Its uniqueness comes from its world building, and the story itself is building to something truly massive. There were moments reading The Way of Kings that gave me chills and had me jumping up and down in excitement and it is official now, I'd thought it after reading the Mistborn trilogy, but now I'm certain: Brandon Sanderson is the God of fantasy book endings. It is worth reading his books for the endings alone and I am entirely jealous of those of you who have yet to experience them for the first time! 
 The characters are wonderful and flawed. Kaladin contains the most build and exploration of any of the characters with his own flashback chapters and self discovery, plus a hefty amount of the chapters being dedicated to him. He is a fantastic character who you want to see win in the end, but he also goes through fits of despair when he feels he is doomed to fail his bridge members and occasionally the ""woe is me"" mentally can get a little old. However, through those parts are these fabulous side characters. Syl the spren who follows Kaladin around, Teft the older guy who turns out to be the most trustworthy of them all, Rock the Horneater who has the biggest heart and made me laugh whether he meant to or not, I don't know, but it was a nice bit of comic relief amongst the depression. 
 We also follow the perspective of Shallan, ward to Jasnah who is sister of the King and a so-called heretic. She was another of my favourites. She's smart and willful and duly takes care of herself. Shallan comes from a family who I very much despise, a family purely out for their own personal gain but Shallan is a little light within them. Though she is sent to steal Jasnah's fabrial, a priceless piece of jewellery which allows the user to use magic known as 'Soulcasting', she finds herself falling in love with this world of research and education and she is as smart as Jasnah. These characters are the closest we come in Roshar1 to strong female characters. Thanks this world's theology, women in Roshar are repressed. Women are the writers, the artists, focusing on the creative arts where men focus on the fighting and the heavy lifting. It works well as a way to show us Roshar's culture, but I am very much hoping to see women bare their hands (currently they must cover their ""safehand"" in a sleeve or glove in public) and sit at the men's tables at dinner later in the series as it hasn't always been this way. 
 Dalinar, brother to the murdered King and uncle to the current sovereign, and Adolin, his son, deserve a mention too. Dalinar is one of the High Princes at war on the Shattered Plains fighting against the frightening Parshendi army, and the only one we really find ourselves respecting. He experiences dreams, or more likely flashbacks to a forgotten time, during Highstorms and people around him believe him to be losing his mind. Adolin was supposedly given a viewpoint to showcase Dalinar a little more clearly and I'm very glad he exists in this way because it gives us a chance to see what's really happening with Dalinar without the worries of a potentially 'unreliable narrator' and the other High Princes. 
 Altogether, we get the viewpoints of royalty and nobility, women, and a slave-turned-Bridgeman, seemingly somebody unimportant. This gives such a well rounded view of the story that it leaves no page unturned. If I had even half of Brandon Sanderson's talent and imagination, I'd be a very lucky little writer-type indeed. 
 Highprince of War, book 2 of the series, is currently being written and it is hoped that it might be released later this year. I really cannot wait! The Way of Kings made its way onto my list of favourite books within about 10 minutes of reading and if you like fantasy and haven't given it a go yet, you're missing out on something great.

 I'm gonna be a little spoilery. :) 
 Why? The re-read was actually rather satisfying. Yes, it's a novel about survival and all the kinds of crap that men make women do to satisfy themselves, but it's also a rather moving novel about keeping (or losing) one's sanity in the face of all those expectations. 
 Never mind the sheer horror of being handcuffed to a bed without hope of being saved because your lover just keeled over, or watching a dog eat your husband as you go thirsty. It's a lot more than just that. It's memories and other humiliations and the struggle to find oneself through one hell of an ordeal. 
 Plus, I kinda like the fact that we're dealing with a very Poe-ish or Aristotelian art-ethic here. It's very focused in time and place, forcing us to go down deep into the subconscious. I can't help but appreciate that more now than when I was younger. *shrug* 
 Either way, I also enjoyed the almost tacked-on feel of the extended denouement. It really gave a sense of reflection and of shoring up her defenses after having them all stripped away, both literally and figuratively. I felt the power of the positive reversal. 
 Now, I should say that I'm revising this from my three stars to four based mainly on the fact that the novel is good on its own, but when I chose to give it three (from memory), I did so based on my enjoyment in comparison with the rest of Stephen King's works. It isn't his strongest novel by far, but it was still quite enjoyable.

On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless - mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky 12-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the ""steam"" that children with the ""shining"" produce when they are slowly tortured to death.
Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant ""shining"" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes ""Doctor Sleep.""
Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan's own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra's soul and survival.

While it is a coming of age story involving various students it also parallels the subtle undertone of the transition of the nation as a whole from one that is carefree to one of regimentation in behavior and thinking. The story provides some insight on how young people perceive war and how they respond to their possible involvement in it. It clearly illustrates that civilian involvement in the war was much more personal and affected more people than it does today; possibly because we felt more vulnerable then. 
 John Knowles uses the preparatory school setting to create an atmosphere of isolation and safety that is slowly being encroached upon by an ominous treat from the outside world. In doing so he parallels America's isolationist response to the war in Europe.

I'm writing my review more about the spirit of the book. Haunted is probably the most cynical book I've ever read. Hey, I'm cynical myself. I think fame and celebrity are bullshit too. I think there are plenty of people that are pain addicted, self-indulgent assholes too. I write in your face, shock horror too. But Palahniuk's book made me want to go OD on heroin in a piss-soaked alley. 
 Look, the guys clearly a genius. Every page is spiked with incredibly imaginative and well-researched scenarios and the structure of the whole thing is novel: A master story threading a series of shorts together like a necklace of rotting heads. Personally, I liked the shorts better than the master story. A lot more. 
 I know horror ain't supposed to uplift, but there wasn't one damned character that didn't drip with some sort of pollution and horrible narcissism. Not a drollop of hope for the human race in the whole thing. Palahniuk's characters are lost souls in a lost world.

So when they made a grisly discovery in the attic, Jack and Syd chose to ignore it. That was a mistake.
Because someone has just been murdered. Right outside their back door.
And now the police are watching them...",Fiction,Intermediate,7,1,15,5.857142857142857,14,3.57,332,3.0,"Jack and Sydney can hardly believe their luck when their offer on their dream house is accepted. So they have to take the house as seen, and so it's full of the previous owner's possessions. And so what if it isn't actually Jack's ideal home. As long as Sydney is happy that's the main thing. Then Jack discovers something in the attic, something that shouldn't be there. And things begin to unravel drastically. 
 I have to admit that when I started to read this book it didn't grab my complete attention. But I continued to read and found that I wanted to find out more. The story is told from the view point of Jack and Sydney, each chapter headed with one the character's names, a witness statement in a more fluid and unofficial form. This style of narration worked well, I liked gleaning information from different viewpoints to round the story out. It also allowed the reader to get to know the characters more. There were issues with both Sydney and Jack. Products of their upbringings, Sydney was standoffish, and prickly but also passionate about certain situations, including helping Elsie, a young girl she befriends. Sydney sees herself reflected in Elsie and wants to change history by helping her. Jack is more needy, more keen to please, and is devoted to Sydney. 
 As the story progresses more is revealed about Sydney's past and the physical abuse she suffered as a child. The reader is guided through a series of events from the past and slowly shown how they collide with the present. I had guessed how things would proceed but it was interesting to see them played out. The murder doesn't happen immediately and indeed is just a small part of the story. I thought this worked well, the death was a necessary part of the tale but doesn't overshadow the bigger picture. 
 There were some things that seemed obvious, or obvious to me, that lessened the effect. That said this is purely a personal thing. This book has been described as spooky though I didn't find it as such. I'm not a fan of horror for example, not because I don't like being scared, but I'm too sensible. I get fed up with characters going down a smoky dark alley instead of towards the town and help for example. So when a scene in the novel depicted Jack investigating a noise downstairs, I just thought 'why doesn't he just put the big light on?' That said, there are many things in here that aren't as expected, such as what is found in the attic - and I won't say more for fear of spoiling it. So, in all honesty, I'm glad that I didn't find the novel spooky. 
 I liked the writing style, sometimes jovial, sometimes serious. This and chapter layout meant for me that I found myself reading the novel quite quickly, the chapters lending themselves to the justification of 'just one more'. There are clues aplenty in each person's narrative and also in what each may omit to write down. I also have to say I really liked the ending. It finished exactly as I think it should have. 
 Reading this back it may sound like I didn't enjoy this novel but I did. I've heard this book described as a marmite book; you'll either love it or loathe it. I like to be different. I didn't love it but I certainly didn't loathe it. I liked it. My enjoyment grew the more I read, and towards the end I was eager to get back to it. I found it an interesting and entertaining read.

WoT book ten, Crossroads of Twilight has the reputation for being the worst/slowest in the series. That may be true, but by no means does it make it a bad book. In my opinion, I think the negative reviews of CoT are a bit exaggerated. 
 There is very little plot advancement in CoT. None of the major subplots really move forward. However, CoT seems to be focused on priming each major subplot to move forward in subsequent books. This seems to be the case based on reviews I've read for Knife of Dreams, the next book. CoT involves a lot of political maneuvering. Jordan gets criticized for going too heavy on the politics from Lord of Chaos onward, but I enjoy the politics. The politics behind the action is what makes the action great. It means that when action actually happens, the stakes are much higher because of all the political maneuvering that underpin it. I think Egwene and the Salidar Aes Sedai are good examples of this. However, the politics have limits, and they were exceeded in CoT. Without even a modicum of action to accompany the heavy politics, it made CoT slow and unbearable at points. Elyane's subplot is a prime example. At the end of Winter's Heart, Elyane is confronted with invaders. Yet, in CoT the invasion stays where it is and we get no development on that front. The worst example of the cliffhanger hangover is Rand. WH ended in a huge way with the cleansing of the taint. However, we don't even get a Rand chapter until 3/4 through the book. For me, that was a big letdown. 
 Despite obvious shortcoming, I still did enjoy CoT. Mat and Tuon's subplot was great. I love their budding relationship. I think that CoT was the necessary segway into having all of the pre-last battle subplots begin to resolve. The book is called Crossroads of Twilight. I believe that the book was a crossroads for the series. With the last battle looming, things need to get resolved. And for things to be resolved, things need to be in place. CoT got the thankless job of getting things in place. Ultimately, I give CoT three stars.

Although I enjoyed MoA much more than CC, I didn't enjoy it this time around nearly as much as the first time I read it about 15 years ago. It is very repetitive (I think MZB could have easily told the same story in under 600 pages, chopping it by about 1/3). I quite like the re-telling from the perspective of female characters, & don't really understand the criticism on that basis; I guess the Arthurian pantheon is too sacrosanct for a re-imagining to appeal to everyone. My last comment is addressed to the reviewers who complain of an anti-Christian bias in the book and use Pagan-bashing to make their point: I think you're both unknowingly validating MZB's premise AND hypocritically engaging in the hateful speech you are decrying. You can't have it both ways, simultaneously bashing another person's beliefs while complaining that your religion is being attacked. That isn't really so hard to understand, is it?

In ""Low Men in Yellow Coats,"" eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood and that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror.
In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest...and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast.
In ""Blind Willie"" and ""Why We're in Vietnam,"" two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow and haunted as their own lives.

Luminous, haunting, unforgettable, The Age of Miraclesis a stunning fiction debut by a superb new writer, a story about coming of age during extraordinary times, about people going on with their lives in an era of profound uncertainty.
On a seemingly ordinary Saturday in a California suburb, 11-year-old Julia and her family awake to discover, along with the rest of the world, that the rotation of the earth has suddenly begun to slow. The days and nights grow longer and longer, gravity is affected, the environment is thrown into disarray. Yet as she struggles to navigate an ever-shifting landscape, Julia is also coping with the normal disasters of everyday life--the fissures in her parents' marriage, the loss of old friends, the hopeful anguish of first love, the bizarre behavior of her grandfather who, convinced of a government conspiracy, spends his days obsessively cataloging his possessions. As Julia adjusts to the new normal, the slowing inexorably continues.

But in the end, it was only worthy of three. 
 Like many Stephen King books I've read, this one had lots of awesomeness, but it was stretched out, with the spaces between filled with drivel. Stephen King loves words, but this one did not require 902 pages of them, believe me. It could easily have been cut down to half the size without losing much of the story. 
 It had its moments, but ultimately it just wasn't good enough. It was the characters, in the end, that I think let this one down.* The two most interesting, Ed Deepnau and The Crimson King, were largely absent from the novel. Instead I had to spend my reading time with Ralph, who came across as dull at best and a dirty old man at the worst, Lois, with those infuriating, constantly observed 'Spanish eyes', Carolyn, an extremely annoying dead person and her never-ending walk back to Eden and a group of slightly-sexist care workers who, while rarely seen managed to make their presence felt for a large part of the novel. It was difficult to sympathise with any of them, the only character out of the bunch I really cared for being an unnamed pregnant woman who featured in the story for all of half a page. and she was dead. 
 There were cool bits, dimension-jumping, mind-control, bald doctors, a pretty decent fight scene, but once again the appearance of The Crimson King disappointed me. And the appearance of The Crimson King was my sole reason for picking up this novel. To be honest, this book didn't really seem to fit in to the whole 'Dark Tower' quest at all. I'd rather Roland himself had showed up in Derry to sort everything out. He could even have sorted out a certain shape-shifter while he was at it. But instead it fell to the two-dimensional Ralph and the whining, useless Lois to sort this one out. 
 Next time, Stephen please give me a hero I actually want to win. 
 *Not to mention a long and dull post-climax ending. Just like 'The Stand'. 
 **I don't know how to hide spoilers, so if you don't want to see this one, please do not look at the following sentence: What the Hell was up with that bit with Susan Day at the end? Why? What was the point? I wasn't upset about it, but it just seemed so utterly stupid. and pointless. Also the ending was almost exactly the same as the ending of 'The Stand', or 'The Talisman', or 'IT'.

When Zoe allows herself to start thinking of children again, she remembers that there are still frozen embryos that she and her husband never used. But she needs his permission to use them.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,2,14,7.111111111111111,14,3.76,205,4.0,"Zoe Baxter has spent ten years trying to get pregnant, and just when she's about to get her heart's desire, tragedy destroys her world. In the aftermath of loss and divorce, she throws herself into her career as a music therapist. Working with Vanessa, she finds their relationship moving from business, to friendship, and then - to Zoe's surprise - blossoming into love. When Zoe allows herself to start thinking of children again, she remembers that there are still frozen embryos that she and her husband never used. But Max, having sought peace at the bottom of a bottle, has found redemption in an evangelical church, and Zoe needs his permission to take his unborn child . . . 
 I'm a huge fan of Jodi Picoult. Her novels make me question a lot of things and her books even teach me things I would otherwise have never have known of. For example, with her last book House Rules, I had no idea about Asperger's syndrome but reading that book was a real experience and eye-opener. When she decides what to base her novels on, she doesn't hold back and really gets to the heart of the topics of her novels. And while if you read all her novels in one go, you might find them formulaic, staggering them out means that they aren't formulaic at all. Sing You Home is one that intrigued me from the word go: I knew Jodi had a son who had recently come out as gay and all you seem to see in the news is same-sex couples fighting to have the same rights as heterosexual couples and although the book is a bit religious, I do believe it was necessary to present the story in the way it was presented and surprisingly, I found myself thoroughly absorbed in the novel. 
 I'm not entirely sure where to start with my review - do I start with the religion or with the same-sex relationship between Zoe and Vanessa. Actually, I'll start at the beginning. Sing You Home, at the beginning of the novel, introduces us to Zoe Baxter. Happily married to Max, even more happily pregnant, and happy in her job as a music therapist. Until during her baby shower, it all goes wrong for her and it ends sans baby and sans Max. Which brings us to Vanessa, who is a friend of Zoe's and as they spend more and more time together, they develop feelings for each other. Now I'm no expert on same-sex relationships, but I do firmly believe you love who you love. Who am I to tell someone that a woman loving a woman or a man loving a man is wrong? I felt Picoult handled the relationship between Zoe and Vanessa beautifully. 
 A lot has been levied at Jodi that she's written the book with an agenda, and I myself can see that. Her son is gay and is having to be gay in a world where same-sex marriage is continually slammed. Where same-sex marriage is only just becoming legal in all states in America, and I must admit, I am ignorant on whether same-sex couples can have kids, because it's not something I generally need to know. Does that make me a bad person for not knowing? No, I don't think so. The two different stories in the novel are a huge contrast to each other, you have Zoe and Vanessa, happy together and wanting to cement their love with a baby and then you have Max and his Church being 100% against Zoe's plans to have a baby. And while the religious stuff is something I am also ignorant about, it didn't feel patronising at all and I could see that the religion had to be in the novel because it's what the other side were basing their defence on - that because the bible says a same-sex couple can't be together or have kids, then that's how the law should see it, too. 
 As well as having a natural affinity for storytelling, Picoult is also really brilliant at giving us characters we care about. For the entire novel I was on Zoe and Vanessa's side. Zoe's infertility struggles and having carried a baby for so long for it to end in tragedy were heart-rending as was Vanessa's struggle to be accepted as a lesbian. Then of course there's their struggle against Max to try and get Zoe's frozen embryos so Vanessa can carry Zoe's child so they can have a family. All of that swirled together and I truly felt for Zoe and Vanessa. Any sympathy I might have had for Max, after all he had lost babies too, disappeared as the book progressed. Obviously as a born-again Christian, he thought he was doing the right thing, but to be honest, it just seemed as if he was being pushed by his Priest. And the lack of backbone rankled with me, because he never actually stood up to say what he wanted. He just repeated what he was told to say. 
 My favourite part of the novel, by far, was seeing Zoe's day job. She's a music therapist and I thought it was so beautiful that we got to see her in action, playing to people with Cancer, to people with rapidly declining health and to a girl desperate to die. I thought the musical backdrop was beautiful. As much as I do think Jodi wrote this novel for the reason, I was hugely impressed with it all the same. It's very much a relevant topic, something that's still ongoing as same-sex couples continually try to get the rights they deserve and it's very on point. I absolutely loved reading the novel, although I found Max's narratives a bit harder to take to as I just couldn't warm to him. The novel is accompanied by a soundtrack, which I haven't listened to (I can't read and listen to music at the same time) but I do think that's a brilliant touch. I didn't expect to enjoy Sing You Home as much as I did, but it says it all about Jodi Picoult abilities that the book touched me the way it did, despite my pre-conceived notions.",0.0,0,108,516.24,4.78,1184,1,4,4

It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.
Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.

 http://fangswandsandfairydust.com/201... 
 Audiobook provided by publisher for review. No remuneration was exchanged and all opinions presented herein are my own except as noted. 
 I enjoyed much of this book but I have a hard time with a cultural anomaly. These British Lords eat ""cookies;"" cookies is not the word in common usage at the time, or even now, in Britain. (http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcooki...) 
 With a tale of desperate love and seriously bad family matters, the love story was interesting. I enjoyed the narration of a romance by a man with a lovely plummy accent. At first it sounded over the top but James Langton's voice was actually a pleasure to listen to. 
 But all I could think of was those cookies, COOKIES! If she had called them biscuits or seed cakes I might have been okay. But we all know that the Regency world, at least as presented in novels, was highly structured and full of manners that were so forced into the aristocracy they must even have been employed in private. These young brothers behave most casually when walking about their house. It is hard to imagine an Earl procuring a fistful of cookies (Page 189), or finding his brothers ""lounging against the wall, munching cookies,"" (page 287), or sauntering out of the kitchen with cookies in hand (page 287). It just feels feels culturally wrong, especially within the genre, although looking at the caricatures and political and social art, for example Rowlandson's, the aristocracy was made to look much less cultured than the way they are presented in the romance genre. 
 It also feels wrong because the while a little unusual, the characters are portrayed as quite cultured and so it feels as if they aren't staying in character. 
 And, I realize I am speaking about genre specific convention which is the langiage of the genre. Expectations don't necessarily have to be fulfilled. 
 There are some great twists and turns and the sexual aspect, which felt unlikely, is included. 
 But, oh well, this was one of Publisher Weekly's best romance books of 2010, so it's entirely possible this is just a case of me being rather picky. It appears to be her first or an early published historical. So it could be a case of research, and surely should have been caught by an editor. 
 But as the story progressed all I could think was ""cookies?!""",1.0,0,4158,16590.420000000002,3.99,592,3,1,3

 Scout Press is a new imprint from Gallery Books ""dedicated to being on the lookout for modern storytellers."" They've roared onto the scene with two releases, Ruth Ware's In A Dark, Dark Woods and (now Longlist National Book Award Nominee) Bill Clegg's Did You Ever Have A Family. I received a promo e-mail about Scout Press before these two were released, and like a chump I passed them over. Once I heard the endless roaring buzz of praise, I picked up In A Dark, Dark Woods on audio, and listened everywhere, all the time, unable to stop. 
 Ware's In A Dark, Dark Wood sounds like many things-don't confuse it with Into The Woods, the Broadway play adapted into a feature film, or master of mystery Tana French's novel In The Woods. Ever since the Brothers Grimm put the grim in our fairy tales, the woods have been a nightmarish place to lose yourself and tap into the pulse of a canopied underworld severed from sunlight and all things good. In A Dark, Dark Wood acts as an homage to so much that lives in the dark of our nightmares-ghosts, guns, unrequited loves, strangers prowling, phone lines cut, murders in the midst. 
 In this mystery, instead of wolves or headless horsemen, the woods brings horrors of a particularly modern variety. Reclusive author Leonora reluctantly agrees to attend a long lost school friend's hen party (for us unaware Americans, that's the British equivalent of a bachelorette party). The most majestic and notable part of this novel is the hen party's setting, a glass house nestled amidst a muddy and isolated woods far out in the English countryside. Each attendee to the soiree feels like a performer, vulnerable and exposed in front of a vast expanse of trees. This is the type of isolated home found at the end of a muddy long drive, where cell reception blips from on bar to none, where the land line in the kitchen feels like a life line to the outside world. 
 The night turns strange quite quickly. Clare, the bride-to-be, has invited a ragtag bunch, with Leonora and her sarcastic sidekick Nina not necessarily adding to the party atmosphere. There's new mother Melanie, who struggles to pull her eyes up from her phone, aghast at no reception. There's flamboyant and coke-touting Tom, the hard partying token gay man at the celebration. And finally, there's Flo. Flo worships Clare, dresses like Clare, and insists that Clare will have the best hen party ever. No matter what. 
 The isolated party in a strange glass house, fueled by alcohol and Flo's intensity, quickly moves past social niceties and into the realm of something else. Leonora wakes up battered and brutalized in a hospital bed, police at her door. No longer in a glass house, no longer at a hen night. She takes us along in her struggle to remember what exactly turned a hen party into a much darker, more dangerous trip into the woods. 
 Ware's building of suspense is magnificent here, especially in the first half of the novel. Unfortunately, amnesia plays a critical plot point near the end, which always tries my patience as a mystery lover. The writing here is so good though, that I'm willing to overlook this. I do hope Ware steers clear of such devices in her next book. The setting and characters build an unbearable, but irresistible paranoia, that makes In A Dark, Dark Wood an ideal mystery, a quick one to flip through then finish.",0.0,0,4240,4197.6,0.99,1153,3,1,5

The crime-thriller genre isn't one I frequent, but I was intrigued, and this is King we're talking about, so I gave it a go. I have such conflicting feelings. 
 One the one hand, King spins an engaging cat-and-mouse tale (hah!) that kept me interested and very engaged. His characters were alive! Even the psychopathic Brady was dimensional and human. Bill Hodges' merry band of friends were so raw and real, and perhaps even more relatable than Hodges' himself. Speaking of the good ol' Det. Ret., Bill Hodges was very well spun - he showed hubris, humility, embarrassment, self-consciousness. I bought into him. King's strength in this novel is his cast of characters. 
 Now, the story fell a bit flat for me. Standard cat-and-mouse game, with quite a bit of predictability. The enthralling bit was how eerily King communicated Brady's instability and mental illness. Someone tell this guy he should be writing horror ;). King terrified me on this count, and generally had me eyeing strangers I met on the street with increased skepticism. 
 I also really struggled with how much King referenced modern tech, people, social media, etc. It really dated the book, and I wanted to scream ""We get it, King, you know about Twitter!"" It was really odd and seemed too deliberate.

When novelist Owen Quine goes missing, his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike. At first, Mrs. Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few days--as he has done before--and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home.
But as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine's disappearance than his wife realizes.

The Wheel of Time(r), Robert Jordan's internationally bestselling fantasy series, has captured the imaginations of millions of readers worldwide. Now book number ten in the series, Crossroads of Twilight, will be available in trade paperback for the first time. This new edition will feature cover art from artist Greg Ruth. This stunning cover art debuted on the eBook and will now grace bookstore shelves in this handsome new edition.
Fleeing from Ebou Dar with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, whom he is fated to marry, Mat Cauthon learns that he can neither keep her nor let her go, not in safety for either of them, for both the Shadow and the might of the Seanchan Empire are in deadly pursuit.
Perrin Aybara seeks to free his wife, Faile, a captive of the Shaido, but his only hope may be an alliance with the enemy. Can he remain true to his friend Rand and to himself? For his love of Faile, Perrin is willing to sell his soul.
At Tar Valon, Egwene al'Vere, the young Amyrlin of the rebel Aes Sedai, lays siege to the heart of Aes Sedai power, but she must win quickly, with as little bloodshed as possible, for unless the Aes Sedai are reunited, only the male Asha'man will remain to defend the world against the Dark One, and nothing can hold the Asha'man themselves back from total power except the Aes Sedai and a unified White Tower.

Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn himself, has cleansed the Dark One's taint from the male half of the True Source, and everything has changed. Yet nothing has, for only men who can channel believe that saidin is clean again, and a man who can channel is still hated and feared-even one prophesied to save the world.

WoT book ten, Crossroads of Twilight has the reputation for being the worst/slowest in the series. That may be true, but by no means does it make it a bad book. In my opinion, I think the negative reviews of CoT are a bit exaggerated. 
 There is very little plot advancement in CoT. None of the major subplots really move forward. However, CoT seems to be focused on priming each major subplot to move forward in subsequent books. This seems to be the case based on reviews I've read for Knife of Dreams, the next book. CoT involves a lot of political maneuvering. Jordan gets criticized for going too heavy on the politics from Lord of Chaos onward, but I enjoy the politics. The politics behind the action is what makes the action great. It means that when action actually happens, the stakes are much higher because of all the political maneuvering that underpin it. I think Egwene and the Salidar Aes Sedai are good examples of this. However, the politics have limits, and they were exceeded in CoT. Without even a modicum of action to accompany the heavy politics, it made CoT slow and unbearable at points. Elyane's subplot is a prime example. At the end of Winter's Heart, Elyane is confronted with invaders. Yet, in CoT the invasion stays where it is and we get no development on that front. The worst example of the cliffhanger hangover is Rand. WH ended in a huge way with the cleansing of the taint. However, we don't even get a Rand chapter until 3/4 through the book. For me, that was a big letdown. 
 Despite obvious shortcoming, I still did enjoy CoT. Mat and Tuon's subplot was great. I love their budding relationship. I think that CoT was the necessary segway into having all of the pre-last battle subplots begin to resolve. The book is called Crossroads of Twilight. I believe that the book was a crossroads for the series. With the last battle looming, things need to get resolved. And for things to be resolved, things need to be in place. CoT got the thankless job of getting things in place. Ultimately, I give CoT three stars. While not a ""bad"" book, it still is one of the weakest in the series thus far.",0.0,0,108,430.92,3.99,1170,1,3,3
344,Anathem,Neal Stephenson,2008,2008,"Fraa Erasmas is a young avout living in the Concent of Saunt Edhar, a sanctuary for mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers, protected from the corrupting influences of the outside ""saecular"" world by ancient stone, honored traditions, and complex rituals. Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls. Three times during history's darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe, becoming out of necessity even more austere and less dependent on technology and material things. And Erasmas has no fear of the outside--the Extramuros--for the last of the terrible times was long, long ago.
Now, in celebration of the week-long, once-in-a-decade rite of Apert, the fraas and suurs prepare to venture beyond the concent's gates--at the same time opening them wide to welcome the curious ""extras"" in. During his first Apert as a fraa, Erasmas eagerly anticipates reconnecting with the landmarks and family he hasn't seen since he was ""collected."" But before the week is out, both the existence he abandoned and the one he embraced will stand poised on the brink of cataclysmic change.
Powerful unforeseen forces jeopardize the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros--a threat that only an unsteady alliance of saecular and avout can oppose--as, one by one, Erasmas and his colleagues, teachers, and friends are summoned forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster. Suddenly burdened with a staggering responsibility, Erasmas finds himself a major player in a drama that will determine the future of his world--as he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey that will carry him to the most dangerous, inhospitable corners of the planet . . . and beyond.",Fiction,Intermediate,4,1,15,9.25,8,4.18,45672,5.0,"Wow. This is a big book. I don't just mean its physical size (3 lbs, 900+ pages, 2"" thick). It contains within it an entire world, and not just one narrative or worldtrack (as Stephenson's characters describe it) of that world, but several. And actually, not just one world, but several. The plot develops in a surprising and huge way, so much so that you might think you were reading two different books if you only read the beginning and the end. 
 The book is divided into sections instead of chapters. It begins as a slow, extremely detailed, introduction into a world quite different, yet also similar, to ours. It develops into a mystery. Then it becomes a wilderness adventure. Then it becomes another kind of equally exciting adventure. Each section catapults you into the next, and the book is very difficult to put down. In fact, I'm happy I'm currently unemployed, as it allowed me days on end to read this book undisturbed. I read for at least 8 hours a day, forgot to eat, forgot to drink, ended up dizzy and with a splitting headache, ate a bit, drank a bit, took some Advil, and kept reading... for three days. 
 About 2/3 of the way through, there's a long, tedious section detailing the science behind this book -- Stephenson does this in his other books, too, and I always find it kind of disrupting and annoying. Basically, he spends this section trying to give the reader a crash course into the research and scientific background involved in creating this story. This section takes place in the form of dinner discussions that sound more like class lectures, and goes on for quite some time. Luckily, it is immediately followed by more action, and then the finally plot section, which is bizarre and unexpected. 
 Unfortunately, the last section just isn't as good as all the rest. It's disjointed, and lacks the detail of the previous sections. I almost feel as if he got tired of writing and just wanted it to end. I, on the other hand, never wanted it to end, and I feel kind of let down by the way it did end.

345,Ulysses,James Joyce,1934,2006,"The most famous day in literature is June 16, 1904, when a certain Mr. Leopold Bloom of Dublin eats a kidney for breakfast, attends a funeral, admires a girl on the beach, contemplates his wife's imminent adultery, and, late at night, befriends a drunken young poet in the city's red-light district.
Ulysseshas been labeled dirty, blasphemous & unreadable. In a 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--tho he found it sufficiently unobscene to allow its importation into the USA--& Virginia Woolf was moved to decry Joyce's ""cloacal obsession."" None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains the modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism & vulgarity to splendid extremes. It's funny, sorrowful, even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. Despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, Ulyssesis also a compulsively readable book. Even the verbal vaudeville of the final chapters can be navigated with relative ease, as long as you're willing to be buffeted, tickled, challenged & (occasionally) vexed by Joyce's sheer command of English. Among other things, a novel is simply a long story. The 1st question about any story is: What happens?. In this case, the answer might be Everything. Wm Blake, one of literature's sublime myopics, saw the universe in a grain of sand. Joyce saw it in Dublin, on 6/16/1904, a day distinguished by its utter normality. Two characters, Stephen Dedalus & Leopold Bloom, go about their separate business, crossing paths with a gallery of indelible Dubliners. We watch them teach, eat, stroll the streets, argue & (in Bloom's case) masturbate. Thanks to the stream-of-consciousness technique--which suggests no mere stream but an impossibly deep, swift-running river--we're privy to their thoughts, emotions & memories. The result? Almost every variety of experience is crammed into the accordian folds of a single day, which makes Ulyssesnot just an experimental work but the very last word in realism. Both characters add their glorious intonations to the music of the prose. Dedalus' accent--that of a freelance esthetician, who dabbles here & there in what we might call Early Yeats Lite--will be familiar to readers of Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man. But Bloom's wistful sensualism (& naive curiosity) is something else entirely. Seen thru his eyes, a rundown corner of a graveyard is a figure for hope & hopelessness, mortality & dogged survival: ""Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland's hearts & hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really?""

AUTHOR'S FOREWORD
You might not want to buy this book.
I know, that's not the sort of thing an author is supposed to say. The marketing people aren't going to like this. My editor is going to have a fit. But I'd rather be honest with you right out of the gate.
First, if you haven't read my other books, you don't want to start here.
My first two books are The Name of the Windand The Wise Man's Fear. If you're curious to try my writing, start there. They're the best introduction to my world. This book deals with Auri, one of the characters from that series. Without the context of those books, you're probably going to feel pretty lost.
Second, even if you have read my other books, I think it's only fair to warn you that this is a bit of a strange story. I don't go in for spoilers, but suffice to say that this one is ... different. It doesn't do a lot of the things a classic story is supposed to do. And if you're looking for a continuation of Kvothe's storyline, you're not going to find it here.
On the other hand, if you'd like to learn more about Auri, this story has a lot to offer. If you love words and mysteries and secrets. If you're curious about the Underthing and alchemy. If you want to know more about the hidden turnings of my world...
Well, then this book might be for you.",Fiction,Intermediate,4,2,14,7.75,11,3.91,107,1.0,"I kind of wish I didn't read this. Despite the fact that this is the sort of thing I could totally love, I much preferred Auri with a bit more mystery.",0.0,0,4240,16917.600000000002,3.99,1156,4,3,1

The novel opens with an evocation of Woolf's last days before her suicide in 1941, and moves to the stories of two modern American women who are trying to make rewarding lives for themselves in spite of the demands of friends, lovers, and family.
Clarissa Vaughan is a book editor who lives in present-day Greenwich Village; when we meet her, she is buying flowers to display at a party for her friend Richard, and ailing poet who has just won a major literary prize. Laura Brown is a housewife in postwar California who is bringing up her only son and looking for her true life outside of her stifling marriage.
With rare ease and assurance, Cunningham makes the two women's lives converge with Virginia Woolf's in an unexpected and heartbreaking way during the party for Richard.

When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks - risks no one else in the department would ever take - to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate.
Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone.
During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love.

Now, eighteen years after the publication of The Pillars of the Earth, Ken Follett has written the most-anticipated sequel of the year: World Without End. In 1989 Ken Follett astonished the literary world with The Pillars of the Earth, a sweeping epic novel set in twelfth-century England centered on the building of a cathedral and many of the hundreds of lives it affected. Critics were overwhelmed--it will hold you, fascinate you, surround you (Chicago Tribune)--and readers everywhere hoped for a sequel. World Without End takes place in the same town of Kingsbridge, two centuries after the townspeople finished building the exquisite Gothic cathedral that was at the heart of The Pillars of the Earth. The cathedral and the priory are again at the center of a web of love and hate, greed and pride, ambition and revenge, but this sequel stands on its own. This time the men and women of an extraordinary cast of characters find themselves at a crossroad of new ideas: about medicine, commerce, architecture, and justice. In a world where proponents of the old ways fiercely battle those with progressive minds, the intrigue and tension quickly reach a boiling point against the devastating backdrop of the greatest natural disaster ever to strike the human race--the Black Death.

 I would recommend this to anyone who liked The Pillars of the Earth and want to relive that with a slightly different cast of characters.

 I have to say I did not enjoy this as much as the first book, and judging by the other reviews I am not alone. The story was slow paced but without the added depth of character and description that there was in the first book. I found I didn't care as much about what happened with the main people and there seemed to be a lot of space filler. 
 Having said that, what I did love was that the author went back to the time when the outbreak began and introduced us to new characters, which later turned out to have links with the ones we had come to know in the first book. This was by far the best bit and I found myself really getting drawn in emotionally to the characters on the bus (particularly the driver who obviously had some form of special needs) and getting really upset at the prospect of them coming to harm. The sniper guy originally started out as someone who seemed a bit of a dick but turned out to be really caring and a good person. Finding out what happened to General Vorhees and others in his family was also crushing and beautifully told, explaining so much of the previous book that seemed irrelevant and nicely setting up the character of Tifty. 
 This kind of emotional investment was lacking for the second half of the book and the part with Lila, Grey and Guilder was just confusing (in terms of how they functioned). The big climax when the 12 would finally defeated also felt rushed, and while I get that this may not have been the main theme of the story it was built up in a way that it should have been. 
 Finally though the emotional ending of Wolgast being reunited with his wife and child, though very Gladiator movie, was proper heart wrenching and I almost welled up on the train to work reading that bit. 
 On the whole it was a good book, but maybe let down simply because the first one was SO MUCH more! Looking forward to starting the 3rd.",0.0,0,108,538.9200000000001,4.99,1164,1,1,3

So writes Mamah Borthwick Cheney in her diary as she struggles to justify her clandestine love affair with Frank Lloyd Wright. Four years earlier, in 1903, Mamah and her husband, Edwin, had commissioned the renowned architect to design a new home for them. During the construction of the house, a powerful attraction developed between Mamah and Frank, and in time the lovers, each married with children, embarked on a course that would shock Chicago society and forever change their lives.
In this groundbreaking historical novel, fact and fiction blend together brilliantly. While scholars have largely relegated Mamah to a footnote in the life of America's greatest architect, author Nancy Horan gives full weight to their dramatic love story and illuminates Mamah's profound influence on Wright.
Drawing on years of research, Horan weaves little-known facts into a compelling narrative, vividly portraying the conflicts and struggles of a woman forced to choose between the roles of mother, wife, lover, and intellectual. Horan's Mamah is a woman seeking to find her own place, her own creative calling in the world, and her unforgettable journey, marked by choices that reshape her notions of love and responsibility, leads inexorably to this novel's stunning conclusion.",Fiction,Intermediate,5,5,15,11.0,6,3.74,126,3.0,"This is the story of Mamah Borthwick, the love of Frank Lloyd Wright. 
 I struggled through a lot of this book, not because it wasn't well written but because I didn't like Mamah. 
 I found her character frustrating and both she and Frank self-centered. So although I enjoyed the writing I did not love the story. This has less to do with the author and more to do with the characters which are not actually fictional. I'm on the fence about how to rate a story like this.

Her children deserved a better mother. 
 Frank was egotistical and crazy and a genius and none of this surprised me although I can't see how a woman would want to deal with the public scorn and loss of family to be with him. Of course, I can't think of any reason to walk out on my child. 
 The end completely took me by surprise. Completely. I'm still shocked and had to search the internet to confirm the tragedy. How had I never heard about this before? It's so senseless.

 Ohhh Sophie and Alex! What am I going to do with you two!? Other than shout at you and make my husband and pups give me looks of, what in the world is she doing over there? ;) 
 This was a really fun read. A bit steamy but not overly so. The characters, as you see above, are equally as fun. Sophie and Alex are both enigmas and you just hope by the end that they will get their crap together instead of letting so much get in the way! They have both been bitten and although they have a fabulous night of passion, neither thinks they'll see the other, but they do and that one night of passion slowly grows into something more. 
 I love the way the plot is paced. These two do jump into bed rather quickly but they are both consenting adults so this really did add to, not take away from the story for me. Actually it was that night that the basis of the story revolves around. It's actually quite frustrating but also a little hilarious how they dance around each other. Alex drives me a little crazy but I really think they both did at different parts of the book. 
 ""I've no expectations tonight, Sophie"" 
 Sophie was saved from having to make a reply as the doors opened on her floor. She quickly stepped out and made her way to her apartment. He was always so in tune with what she was thinking. Were her feelings written all over her face? Or had their night together created a connection between them that couldn't be broken? But if that were true, why couldn't she feel or see wht Alex was thinking? Perhaps it was etter that she didn't. She had to try to sever their connection, otherwise working with him would be evern harder than she tought it would be. 
 She held the door open for him and he indicated for her to precede him into the room. She turned the lights on, but dimmed them so they created a soft glow. The full moon created a ghostly pattern on the river and was shining in through her window. 
 ""How would you like your coffee?"" she asked as she made her way into the kitchen to turn her automatic coffee machine on. ""I can give you an espresso, cappuccino, latte, or flat white."" 
 She tried to control the shivers coursing through her as he came up to stand behind her. Even after all they'd been through that evening, his aftershave wafted over her. 
 He whistled softly. ""That's an impressive machine. You must like your coffee."" 
 Do you SEE what I mean here? These two, H O T! No sex in that scene but boy did I need some water through this entire book. It's fabulous. 
 The only character I didn't like was of course Neil but he is in the plot for a reason, so we all hate him. And I so do. It was Phoebe that really made this for me though. She is just one of those gals that made me feel like I would tell all of my secrets to and never regret it.

I didn't read the back very thoroughly; it was part of a buy-two-get-one-free deal at Barnes & Noble. 
 Anyway, it turns out to be almost more of a detective novel, but set in ancient Egypt. Rahotep, a Medjay detective, is summoned to Akhenaten's capitol city and informed that he must find the missing queen Nefertiti within ten days, before a particular festival takes place. 
 I won't give away how the mystery goes, of course, but it's a solid mystery novel spiced by its setting. Many other characters familiar to those who read fiction set in ancient Egypt such as the sculptor Thutmose, Nefertiti's sister Mutnodjmet, the mysterious Ay, and others appear to varying degrees of importance. 
 All in all it's enjoyable both as a mystery, which I'm usually less inclined to, and as a piece of historical fiction, which is my favorite niche.",0.0,0,6102,6040.98,0.99,397,5,4,4

379,Firefly Lane,Kristin Hannah,2008,2013,"In the turbulent summer of 1974, Kate Mularkey has accepted her place at the bottom of the eighth-grade social food chain. Then, to her amazement, the ""coolest girl in the world"" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become TullyandKate. Inseparable.
So begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.
From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness.
Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend. . . .
For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,13,13,13.0,3,4.04,7,3.0,"In the early 1970's two unlikely girls, Tuly and Kate, are brought together in middle school and develop a friendship that spans three decades. As life takes the typical twists and turns, the friendship is tested. 
 This is a pretty formulaic story line filled with every stereotype you can imagine. While the characters were pretty one-dimensional and the storyline predictable, overall it was an enjoyable read. I think for me it was the right book at the right time. I started it on Mother's Day, which is always a bit of an emotional day, missing the major mother figures in my life. So a mindless, quick read was perfect. I also really appreciated Hannah weaving the signs for Inflammatory Breast Cancer into the story. It is important that women know it is not just about feeling for lumps, and Hannah brings this to light without overdoing it. If you came to age in the 70's and 80's you are likely to enjoy the nostalgic trip down memory lane through the pop-culture references. 
 I certainly would not recommend this for everyone. If you enjoy chick-lit and beach reads, this is probably a good read for you. If you are fortunate to have a best friend who has known you since childhood, especially if that friend is one of the few people who you know love you no matter your flaws, I think you feel a connection to Tuly and Kate.

Flight Behavior transfixes from its opening scene, when a young woman's narrow experience of life is thrown wide with the force of a raging fire. In the lyrical language of her native Appalachia, Barbara Kingsolver bares the rich, tarnished humanity of her novel's inhabitants and unearths the modern complexities of rural existence. Characters and reader alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory here, into the unsettled ground of science, faith, and everyday truces between reason and conviction.
Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen. Now, after a decade of domestic disharmony on a failing farm, she has settled for permanent disappointment but seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation with a younger man. As she hikes up a mountain road behind her house to a secret tryst, she encounters a shocking sight: a silent, forested valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand it as a cautionary miracle, but it sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists, religious leaders, and the media. The bewildering emergency draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists, opportunists, sightseers, and a striking biologist with his own stake in the outcome. As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle, Dellarobia confronts her family, her church, her town, and a larger world, in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed.

(He died on July 31st, 2012 at the age of 86.) The triumphant arc of Vidal's literary career wasn't solely a mastery of language, though that never hurts.

This cloud is self-sustaining and self-reproducing. It is intelligent and learns from experience. For all practical purposes, it is alive.
It has been programmed as a predator. It is evolving swiftly, becoming more deadly with each passing hour.
Every attempt to destroy it has failed.
And we are the prey.",Fiction,Intermediate,15,1,15,5.9375,10,3.72,133370,4.0,"This is my first Michael Crichton read, and I loved it. Prey is told in first person by Jack Foreman, a stay-at-home dad, who suspects his wife, Julia, of having an affair. Julia, a vice president at Xymos, a molecular manufacturing company, works late night, and one night she doesn't even come home at all. Eventually, Julia shows Jack a video demonstration of what they're working on - a cloud of nanoparticles, which works as one big camera. Then something goes wrong at the facility and Jack is invited by Ricky, his former employee to come and help fix the problem. A cloud of nanoparticles -- micro-robots -- has escaped from the laboratory, and he has to get it back. But this cloud is self-reproducing, intelligent; it evolves quickly, and is now a threat. There at the facility Jack learns the truth about his wife, the nanoparticles, and his former co-workers. 
 The book has a slow start. Jacks suspects his wife of having an affair and he's taking time on deciding what to do because he isn't very sure yet. He doesn't want a divorce; he wants to keep his family together, and his kids, always biting each other, are not helping matters. He can't get a job; he's rejected wherever he applies because of a 'got fired for doing the right thing' incident in his former workplace. 
 And then the story kicks off when he's asked to come and solve a problem at the plant. Then comes the action, the suspense, and of course the thrill. You wouldn't want to be anywhere near the swarms - those molecular robots. They're dangerous, they hurt the skin, and they can get into your nasal cavity, suffocating you. They kill wildlife as well as humans. Jack has to stop it, no matter what. Because he designed the program used in modeling the swarms. But he can't do it himself. There are other notable characters there like the quiet, strong and beautiful Mae; devious Ricky; loud-farting/non-stop talking Charley; and of course Jack's beautiful and secretive wife, Julia. Some of these characters help to achieve the goal, while others stand in Jack's way. There are lots of deaths in the end. 
 I loved the technological and biological details the author wove in the various part of the story. It's blended well into the narrative and doesn't cause any distraction. Even though I found some of them boring or overly done, I still learnt something from them. 
 The five-paged bibliography at the end of the book shows well the thorough research undertaken by the author for this book. It is a book worth reading, and I'll certainly read more titles from Crichton. I have my mind on Jurassic Park next. Although I've seen the movie, I'd still love to experience the book side of it. 
 I recommend this book to any sci-fi and techno-thriller lover. If you like the science-goes-wrong genre, then this is the book for you.

 I remember reading this book for grade 11 English, and to tell you the truth the details had stayed fairly clear in my mind. When I reread it for the Banned group I found a lot of the book to be familiar to a detailed degree. I wasn't expecting that. I can see why it had made such an impression on me at that age though. 
 Reading it again now as a much older person I'm glad to say that it has held up very well. It might be a bit dated but the ideas contained in the book really don't have a time to them. I think it was assigned to us as essay fodder. That is because we get such a variety of characters, such a variety of views about the war and youth and life, that you could write thirty different essays on the same question with relative ease! 
 The favourite scene in the book for me will always be the ""winter carnival"" that gives us the title phrase. Just a little made up fun on a winter afternoon, when these boys know that they are mere months away from going to war. It's the last gasp of youth, and play. When it's ended with the telegram from Leper the world changes for all of them.

396,Doctor Sleep,Stephen King,2013,2013,"Stephen King returns to the characters and territory of one of his most popular novels ever, The Shining, in this instantly riveting novel about the now middle-aged Dan Torrance (the boy protagonist of The Shining) and the very special 12-year-old girl he must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals.
On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless - mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky 12-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the ""steam"" that children with the ""shining"" produce when they are slowly tortured to death.
Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant ""shining"" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes ""Doctor Sleep.""
Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan's own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra's soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of hyper-devoted fans of The Shining and wildly satisfy anyone new to the territory of this icon in the King canon.",Fiction,Intermediate,21,1,15,6.857142857142857,8,4.1,98088,5.0,This was definitely my favorite of King's recent works.,0.0,0,361,357.39,0.99,283,1,4,5
397,Crossroads Of Twilight,Robert Jordan,2003,2014,"The #1 New York Timesbestseller, available in trade paperback for the first time--featuring new cover art
The Wheel of Time(r), Robert Jordan's internationally bestselling fantasy series, has captured the imaginations of millions of readers worldwide. Now book number ten in the series, Crossroads of Twilight, will be available in trade paperback for the first time. This new edition will feature cover art from artist Greg Ruth. This stunning cover art debuted on the eBook and will now grace bookstore shelves in this handsome new edition.
Fleeing from Ebou Dar with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, whom he is fated to marry, Mat Cauthon learns that he can neither keep her nor let her go, not in safety for either of them, for both the Shadow and the might of the Seanchan Empire are in deadly pursuit.
Perrin Aybara seeks to free his wife, Faile, a captive of the Shaido, but his only hope may be an alliance with the enemy. Can he remain true to his friend Rand and to himself? For his love of Faile, Perrin is willing to sell his soul.
At Tar Valon, Egwene al'Vere, the young Amyrlin of the rebel Aes Sedai, lays siege to the heart of Aes Sedai power, but she must win quickly, with as little bloodshed as possible, for unless the Aes Sedai are reunited, only the male Asha'man will remain to defend the world against the Dark One, and nothing can hold the Asha'man themselves back from total power except the Aes Sedai and a unified White Tower.
In Andor, Elayne Trakland fights for the Lion Throne that is hers by right, but enemies and Darkfriends surround her, plotting her destruction. If she fails, Andor may fall to the Shadow, and the Dragon Reborn with it.
Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn himself, has cleansed the Dark One's taint from the male half of the True Source, and everything has changed. Yet nothing has, for only men who can channel believe that saidin is clean again, and a man who can channel is still hated and feared-even one prophesied to save the world. Now, Rand must gamble again, with himself at stake, and he cannot be sure which of his allies are really enemies.",Fiction,Intermediate,12,1,12,6.083333333333333,8,3.82,67,3.0,"""If your enemy offers you two targets, strike at a third."" WoT book ten, Crossroads of Twilight has the reputation for being the worst/slowest in the series. That may be true, but by no means does it make it a bad book. In my opinion, I think the negative reviews of CoT are a bit exaggerated. 
 There is very little plot advancement in CoT. None of the major subplots really move forward. However, CoT seems to be focused on priming each major subplot to move forward in subsequent books. This seems to be the case based on reviews I've read for Knife of Dreams, the next book. CoT involves a lot of political maneuvering. Jordan gets criticized for going too heavy on the politics from Lord of Chaos onward, but I enjoy the politics. The politics behind the action is what makes the action great. It means that when action actually happens, the stakes are much higher because of all the political maneuvering that underpin it. I think Egwene and the Salidar Aes Sedai are good examples of this. However, the politics have limits, and they were exceeded in CoT. Without even a modicum of action to accompany the heavy politics, it made CoT slow and unbearable at points. Elyane's subplot is a prime example. At the end of Winter's Heart, Elyane is confronted with invaders. Yet, in CoT the invasion stays where it is and we get no development on that front. The worst example of the cliffhanger hangover is Rand. WH ended in a huge way with the cleansing of the taint. However, we don't even get a Rand chapter until 3/4 through the book. For me, that was a big letdown. 
 Despite obvious shortcoming, I still did enjoy CoT. Mat and Tuon's subplot was great. I love their budding relationship. I think that CoT was the necessary segway into having all of the pre-last battle subplots begin to resolve. The book is called Crossroads of Twilight. I believe that the book was a crossroads for the series. With the last battle looming, things need to get resolved. And for things to be resolved, things need to be in place. CoT got the thankless job of getting things in place. Ultimately, I give CoT three stars. While not a ""bad"" book, it still is one of the weakest in the series thus far.",0.0,0,108,430.92,3.99,1170,1,4,3

Feanor dan keturunannya termasuk Maedhros (putra sulungnya) memutuskan untuk keluar dari Valinor. Mereka mengucapkan sumpah yang menghantui diri mereka sendiri di kemudian hari.

The writing is extremely good, and the story is build on a 3rd person narration with alternating POVs. This story is not just about romance and building romantic tension that both heroines feel is better left unacknowledged. It's also about morals, guilt, doing the rightful thing and about shedding some more truth on a murder cased closed over 10 years ago. 
 The murder case is going to be a very important (and suspenseful) element of the story, as well as an important catalyst between Gina and Landon - because their relationship evolves whenever the case does. 
 I liked the fact that the story placed both heroes on equal footing, but on opposite sides, and how gradually, they met each other halfway in their convictions and helped one another to trade off their guilt and grief. 
 One reviewer said that they found Landon annoyingly hot and cold, and I agree. I found it pretty weird that Landon was so deeply convinced to have identified the right man on one day, and then completely doubtful about it the other. From one day to the other, he started cooperating with Gina and encouraging her to dig deeper into the Cyrus Alexander case, while he was extremely upset about it at the beginning. And in the end, he throws a fit because Gina's company wants to drop the case altogether. 
 And all along the story, Landon is given the role of the lost puppy that needs consoling, a duty that Gina is more than willing to take on. I just do not think his whole behaviour coincides with the rest of the story, especially with the achievements from his past. Despite growing up without a mom and with a dad who didn't want him, he made a name out of himself by becoming a renowned athlete, has several good friends and a coach who almost stands in as a father figure to him. Yet, he doesn't seem to have gotten over what happened... I don't think this adds up with all his achievements? 
 Another important pillar of the story is about two opponents becoming emotionally involved and thus creating a conflict of interest. This concept was interesting, yet I believe it was discarded way too quickly. At the beginning, Gina got reprimanded by her boss and other characters in the book, when in the end, everyone seemed to be OK with it and actually encourage it. And as for Landon, he never did care in the slightest that engaging into a relationship with Gina would be bad for his career. He did in fact consider hers, but not his own... 
 Anyway... some of the things didn't add up, or maybe I am just too stubborn to get hung up on details. But all in all, I liked the book - even if it wasn't one of my faves - because it was refreshing in terms of the storyline. I'd certainly consider reading other works from this author.",0.0,0,3600,17964.0,4.99,11,3,1,3

Archie--working-class, ordinary, a failed marriage under his belt--is calling it quits, the deciding factor being the flip of a 20-pence coin. When the owner of a nearby halal butcher shop (annoyed that Archie's car is blocking his delivery area) comes out and bangs on the window, he gives Archie another chance at life and sets in motion this richly imagined, uproariously funny novel.
Epic and intimate, hilarious and poignant, White Teethis the story of two North London families--one headed by Archie, the other by Archie's best friend, a Muslim Bengali named Samad Iqbal. Pals since they served together in World War II, Archie and Samad are a decidedly unlikely pair. Plodding Archie is typical in every way until he marries Clara, a beautiful, toothless Jamaican woman half his age, and the couple have a daughter named Irie (the Jamaican word for ""no problem""). Samad --devoutly Muslim, hopelessly ""foreign""-- weds the feisty and always suspicious Alsana in a prearranged union. They have twin sons named Millat and Magid, one a pot-smoking punk-cum-militant Muslim and the other an insufferable science nerd. The riotous and tortured histories of the Joneses and the Iqbals are fundamentally intertwined, capturing an empire's worth of cultural identity, history, and hope.

 When the wife of a prominent lawyer goes missing at a dinner party, a police search is begun as soon as they are informed. Finding her body in a well in the garden is the beginning of a case for Simpson's detective, Inspector Thanet, which exposes an extremely dysfunctional family: distant father, mother with compulsive shopping and adultery habits, daughter with unsuitable fiancee, another daughter who disappeared four years ago with her own unsuitable boyfriend, never to be heard of again. 
 The Mintar family could provide material for several crime novels; they have a large number of problems and secrets. It is a case where Thanet has almost too many avenues of enquiry, and, taken by itself, the novel would be a superior if traditional mystery. Looking at in relation to the series as a whole, one aspect of Dead and Gone really stands out. Part of the mystery involves incest between a brother and sister who do not know that they are related.

435,Cell,Stephen King,2006,2006,"There is a reason cell rhymes with hell.
On October 1, God is in His heaven, the stock market stands at 10,140, most of the planes are on time, and Clayton Riddell, an artist from Maine, is almost bouncing up Boylston Street in Boston. He's just landed a comic book deal that might finally enable him to support his family by making art instead of teaching it. He's already picked up a small (but expensive!) gift for his long-suffering wife, and he knows just what he will get for his boy Johnny. Why not a little treat for himself? Clay is feeling good about the future.
That changes in a hurry. The cause of the devastation is a phenomenon that will come to be known as The Pulse, and the delivery method is a cell phone. Everyone's cell phone. Clay and the few desperate survivors who join him suddenly find themselves in the pitch-black night of civilization's darkest age, surrounded by chaos, carnage, and a human horde that has been reduced to its basest nature...and then begins to evolve.
There is really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clay, an arrow points home to Maine, and as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north they begin to see crude signs confirming their direction. A promise, perhaps. Or a threat...
There are 193 million cell phones in the United States alone. Who doesn't have one? Stephen King's utterly gripping, gory, and fascinating novel doesn't just ask the question,Can you hear me now? It answers it with a vengeance.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,1,13,4.7,13,3.64,2582,4.0,"Stephen King finally jumped into the zombie bandwagon, and what a jump! Lots of gory description: ""intestines hanging out"", ""ears torn off leaving holes in the head"", ""festering leg wounds"", definitely not for the squeamish reader. Non-stop action as a group of survivors from The Pulse are being driven or herded into a killing ground. The only lull comes when the group members are debating what happened or planning some mayhem against the zombies. 
 It's a well known fact to the scientific community that a nuclear explosion above the atmosphere could destroy electronic devices on the ground unless these are shielded in some way - they named it electromagnetic pulse or EMP. Stephen King took literary license by limiting the damage to cell phones only and called it The Pulse with a capital ""P"". At least that's a theory of the group of survivors, although one of them thinks it could have been a virus or worm in the cell phone network. Anyway, when The Pulse happened, everybody using a cell phone were turned into mindless, violent, robot-like creatures. Clay and Tom, strangers to each other, banded together early, when they saw what was happening around them. They also saved a 15-year old girl, Alice, who was traumatized when her own mother became a zombie and attacked her so violently that she had to defend herself. Clay, estranged from his wife and devoted to their son, wanted to search for them and he cannot be dissuaded by the other two. Along the way, they meet a schoolmaster and one of his students, Jordan, who is an accomplished computer geek. They become aware that a leader (they named him Raggedy Man), has risen from the ranks of the zombies and the zombies themselves have begun to develop telepathic and levitation abilities. When the combined group destroys a ""flock"" of zombies by burning them, the Raggedy Man led the remaining zombies to kill all the disorganized normals they could find as a reprisal. Clay's group is so horrified by the savagery, that they decided to suspend any hostilities against the zombies. By now, the Raggedy Man can communicate with them telepathically and they were declared a protected group as they were herded into another city, where the group suspected they were going to be killed as a warning to everyone who opposed the zombies. Clay's group meets more people who did something similar to what they have done and they combined forces - one of them was a pregnant woman, Denise, who lost a husband to the zombies. Travelling with her and protecting her is an explosive expert, Ray. They also met bands of normals who are working with, and sometimes protecting the zombies, and they lost one of their members to this band. The climax of the story happened in a country fairground. It is here that Clay finally meets his wife, who has already become one of the zombies, but his son is still missing. Clay's group finally wins over the zombies and resumes their journey to escape. Clay separates from the remaining members in order to search for his son - and finds him, another victim of The Pulse, although a non-violent one. 
 At the end of the book, Clay believing Jordan's theory that another dose of The Pulse might cure his son, was holding a cell phone to his ear and dialling.

It happened on a tree-lined street in Notting Hill to a woman who seemed to have the perfect life. Ellie Lerner's best friend, Lucy, was murdered in front of her young daughter. And, as best friends do, Ellie dropped everything--her marriage, her job, her life in the Boston suburbs--to travel to London and pick up the pieces of Lucy's life. While Lucy's husband, Greg, copes with his grief by retreating into himself, eight-year-old Sophie has simply stopped speaking.
Desperate to help Sophie, Ellie turns to a book that gave her comfort as a child, The Secret Garden.As the two spend hours exploring the novel's winding passageways, its story of hurt, magic, and healing blooms around them.

Yet in one twisted connivance of fate, tragedy can strike not once, not twice, but multiple times. All throughout their ordeal, I always thought that if Donna just had a mobile phone, things would've turned out differently; but of course there'd be no story.

One of the most revered novelists of our time - a brilliant chronicler of Native-American life - Louise Erdrich returns to the territory of her bestselling, Pulitzer Prize finalist The Plague of Doves with The Round House, transporting readers to the Ojibwe reservation in North Dakota. It is an exquisitely told story of a boy on the cusp of manhood who seeks justice and understanding in the wake of a terrible crime that upends and forever transforms his family.
Riveting and suspenseful, arguably the most accessible novel to date from the creator of Love Medicine, The Beet Queen, and The Bingo Palace, Erdrich's The Round House is a page-turning masterpiece of literary fiction - at once a powerful coming-of-age story, a mystery, and a tender, moving novel of family, history, and culture.",Fiction,Intermediate,12,12,16,14.25,14,3.91,69142,4.0,"Louise Erdrich showed her skill and finesse in this story in which she shows us the length and depth of Indian and reservation law, business, and relationships.

 Her enormous skill is revealed as she unveils the relationship between the victim, her husband (the judge) and her son. When she takes the next step and drops the Indian law bomb on us we delve deeper into the life and moral fiber of the father. As we learn about the mother's work -- even while she is in the throes of the rape's aftermath we are shown a good deal about the ways of the reservation -- and how they are not allowed to interact with the those of the world. 
 Most brilliant are the relationships of the son -- whose coming of age story is spotlighted in the book -- with his parents, his extended family, the family and church friends on the reservation, and his four buddies who are leaping on their bikes and on missions that are reminiscent of the movie ""Stand by Me"" and so typical of boys of an age.

Addie Baum is The Boston Girl, born in 1900 to immigrant parents who were unprepared for and suspicious of America and its effect on their three daughters. Growing up in the North End, then a teeming multicultural neighborhood, Addie's intelligence and curiosity take her to a world her parents can't imagine - a world of short skirts, movies, celebrity culture and new opportunities for women. Addie wants to finish high school and dreams of going to college. She wants a career and to find true love.

From the one-room tenement apartment she shared with her parents and two sisters, to the library group for girls she joins at a neighborhood settlement house, to her first, disastrous love affair, Addie recalls her adventures with compassion for the naive girl she was and a wicked sense of humor.

It is literally Addie's life story, told to her granddaughter when she is in her 80s. I like stories like these because they remind me how much life can happen over a lifetime, if that makes sense. Things happen to Addie - some big, some small, some happy, some tragic - but time never stops passing and her life continues moving forward. That resonates with me a lot in general. 
 That being said, this is a story about the spunky daughter of immigrants and there really isn't anything special about that. It also has very simplistic writing that made it a breeze to finish in an evening but never fully pulled me into the scene.

Set in the Maine territory King has made mythic, Bag of Bonesrecounts the plight of forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan, who is unable to stop grieving even four years after the sudden death of his wife, Jo, and who can no longer hear to face the blank screen of his word processor.
Now his nights are plagued by vivid nightmares of the house by the lake. Despite these dreams, or perhaps because of them, Mike finally returns to Sara Laughs, the Noonan's isolated summer home.
He finds his beloved Yankee town familiar on its surface, but much changed underneath -- held in the grip of a powerful millionaire, Max Devore, who twists the very fabric of the community to his purpose: to take his three-year-old granddaughter away from her widowed young mother. As Mike is drawn into their struggle, as he falls in love with both of them, he is also drawn into the mystery of Sara Laughs, now the site of ghostly visitations, ever-escalating nightmares, and the sudden recovery of his writing ability. What are the forces that have been unleashed here -- and what do they want of Mike Noonan?
As vivid and enthralling as King's most enduring works, Bag of Bonesresonates with what Amy Tan calls ""the witty and obsessive voice of King's powerful imagination."" It's no secret that King is our most mesmerizing storyteller. In Bag of Bones-- described by Gloria Naylor as ""a love story about the dark places within us all"" -- he proves to be one of our most moving.",Fiction,Intermediate,20,1,16,6.05,4,3.87,5,2.0,"I did not enjoy the journey. I did not feel good at the end. Too many unclear dreams and partial psychic visions. 
 Underneath this was a good story and would have been a good novella. But I felt like the author threw in filler to make it novel length. The story begins with Mike losing his wife due to a brain aneurism (or something internal). The first 3 1/2 hours are about Mike's grief and writer's block. I was tired of it. For me, the story finally begins when Mike meets three-year-old Kyra and her mother Mattie. Mattie's husband died in an accident. Her wealthy evil father-in-law is suing for custody of Kyra. Mike becomes a friend to Kyra and Mattie and hires a lawyer to help them. The rest of the story has too much vaguery. Mike has several dreams and nightmares. He has many partial psychic visions. Ghosts are doing things, not fully explained. The local townspeople don't like Mattie and later don't like Mike. Their reasons and actions were not explained. Finally at the end there is a tell-all where someone asks Mike questions and Mike explains: back in 1901 this happened, then later these other things happened, and recently this happened and why. Tell-alls at the end are not a good vehicle for me. I prefer learning bits and pieces as one journeys through the story. So this disappointed me. 
 At the end of the book I was not clear about things, for example why certain local townspeople did what they did. I wanted to know more about Max and Rogette. Max tried to kill someone, but it didn't work. So why didn't Max hire someone to do it? He hired someone to kill another. Why didn't the shooter's buddies help the shooter when the shooter was in trouble? A good guy tries to help a drowning bad guy. The bad guy bites the hand trying to help and ends up dying. Why bite? 
 FOR SENSITIVE READERS: 
 There was a horrible-violent-rape-murder scene. It was depressing and stayed in my thoughts too much afterwards. A short part of the story has depressing and sad content about prejudice and violence against blacks. Language includes racial slurs. 
 NARRATOR: 
 Stephen King narrated. I believe he did the local Maine accent well. I love him as an author but not as a narrator. He says Mondeey, Tuesdeey, and a few other things which are unpleasant for me. I prefer actors with generic accents. 
 MINI-EPILOGUE TO ANOTHER BOOK: 
 In this book Norris Ridgeway has a small part as sheriff. Norris says that the former sheriff Alan Pangborn and Polly moved to New Hampshire. (They were the main characters in the book Needful Things.)

Halloween is a wild, weird night in the lonely moorland towns of the north. It's dark and cold, and cracks can open up in the fabric of the safest world.
Davey Bell has been trying to live safely. He's struggled through a rough adolescence and has a decent job, a home of his own. He agrees to a meeting with his ex, even though Burdo got him into so much trouble in the past.
But Burdo has plans, armed robbery amongst them. When Davey recoils from his efforts at blackmail, Burdo swears he'll track him down. There's something inhuman about Burdo's rage, and Davey panics and runs from him. The town is small, the darkness beyond it absolute. Davey has lived there all his life, but he takes a wrong turn on the moorland road and is suddenly lost.
It's the first night of winter, and set to freeze hard. Not much chance of survival for a man without shelter, a man on the run from his past... Then Davey stumbles into the forest, and his fears of Burdo and the cold dissolve to nothing at the sound of deep, bestial growls.
The moon is full. Ancient moorland legends are coming to life in its silvery radiance. Out of the woodland steps a strange young man, and the snarling beasts fall back. He's offering sanctuary, but at what price? He's the most beautiful creature Davey has ever seen. If Davey follows him in fascination through the gateway of Wolf Hall, what secrets will unfold before the dawn?

 As I've mentioned several times in previous reviews, I love original and refreshing plots and characters. Gone lacked both of these. Knowing that the novel was about a student-teacher romance I expected high-stakes and angst but instead it was causal, bland, and boring.

His mother's alcoholism was random and didn't really affect the plot other than to isolate Connor from his family, which I guess may have led Connor to seek companionship in Corrina? One of the most poorly written aspects was the romance between Corinna and Connor. I didn't understand the initial attraction or the sexual tension. I thought it was really juvenile and unrealistic that they'd fall in love with each other in only a week and become so intimate so quickly. This was definitely not an accurate representation of how relationships, let alone studen-teacher relationships evolve. 
 I think Kathleen Jeffrie Johnson tried to tackle too many issues in such a short novel and it ended up as a jumble in the end. Alcoholism, death, teenage romance, sexuality, student-teacher relationships, drug abuse, loneliness, abuse, etc. are all very controversial and tough issuse to conquer individually let alone all in th same novel. I wish that Connor's thought process had been more clearly explained, for example if he had compared his relationship to Zach and Risa's and seen the differences for him and Corrina the reader might have understood why he wanted to move with her so badly. In novels like this it's so hard to write an ending that applies to each of these topics so in the end Kathleen focused on isolation (hence the title ""Gone"") which may have worked as a final chapter if there weren't so many other pressing issues and logistics left unfinished. 
 Despite not liking the overall novel there were a few points I did enjoy. I thought it was very creative to have the student-teacher romance not take place during the school year or on school property but rather in the summer, where the chances of being caught and the repurcussions were a bit different. I liked how Corinna was an average formally-troubled woman who happened to fall in love with a student as opposed to a sensual provocative woman lurring every male at school. The fact that she was as isolated and naive as Connor made her seem more like a fellow student than someone almost 10 years older than him.",0.0,0,670,3678.3,5.49,166,2,2,2

The crime-thriller genre isn't one I frequent, but I was intrigued, and this is King we're talking about, so I gave it a go. I have such conflicting feelings. 
 One the one hand, King spins an engaging cat-and-mouse tale (hah!) that kept me interested and very engaged. His characters were alive! Even the psychopathic Brady was dimensional and human. Bill Hodges' merry band of friends were so raw and real, and perhaps even more relatable than Hodges' himself. Speaking of the good ol' Det. Ret., Bill Hodges was very well spun - he showed hubris, humility, embarrassment, self-consciousness. I bought into him. King's strength in this novel is his cast of characters. 
 Now, the story fell a bit flat for me. Standard cat-and-mouse game, with quite a bit of predictability. The enthralling bit was how eerily King communicated Brady's instability and mental illness. Someone tell this guy he should be writing horror ;). King terrified me on this count, and generally had me eyeing strangers I met on the street with increased skepticism. 
 I also really struggled with how much King referenced modern tech, people, social media, etc. It really dated the book, and I wanted to scream ""We get it, King, you know about Twitter!"" It was really odd and seemed too deliberate.

 I enjoyed this first installment in the series, which gives account of Elizabeth Woodville's climb from landless post-war widow to queen and wife to Edward IV. However, I felt like Elizabeth, as the point-of-view character, acted more like a cardboard cut-out or fly on the wall than an actual character with feelings and opinions.

It is really a whirlwind of a book, one major event after another just keeps on happening to Allegra, her family, or one of her clients (Allegra is an entertaiment attorney). It is rather fast paced for the most part, which to me, is pretty typical for a DS novel. I have to say, so much of this is rather unrealistic, the fact that so many major things keep happening, no one person in real life could possibly have all these kinds of things going on in their life.

Paris, L.A., and the world of ready to wear fashion provide rich backdrops for Danielle Steel's deeply involving story of a gifted designer whose talent and drive have brought her everything--except the ability to erase her past and trust relationships.
FIRST SIGHT 
New York. London. Milan. Paris. Fashion Week in all four cities. A month of endless interviews, parties, and unflagging work and attention to detail at the semiannual ready to wear fashion shows--the famous pret-a-porter. At the center of the storm and avalanche of work is American Timmie O'Neill, whose renowned line, Timmie O, is the embodiment of casual chic, in fashion and for the home. She has created a business that inspires, fills, and consumes her life.
With an unerring instinct for what the next trend will be, an innate genius for business, tireless labor, and sheer fearlessness, starting from nothing, over two decades Timmie has built an international empire that has brought her enormous satisfaction and success. In a world where humility and compassion are all too rare, her humor, kindness, integrity, and creativity are inspirational. Yet as blessed as she feels by her success, Timmie harbors the private wounds of a devastating childhood and past tragedy. She is too smart, too experienced, and too hurt to want much in her personal life beyond a succession of convenient, very limited relationships. Always willing to take risks in business, she never risks her heart.
But despite her well-ordered and highly controlled world, it turns out that Timmie O'Neill is not immune to magic when it strikes. And it strikes in Paris during Paris Fashion Week, when an intriguing Frenchman comes into her life when she gets sick. At first, Timmie and Jean-Charles Vernier are only patient and physician. They become confidants and friends, corresponding at a safe distance between Paris and Los Angeles once she goes home. There is every reason why they must remain apart. But neither can deny their growing friendship and the electricity that sparks whenever they meet.
First Sightis as complex and compelling as modern life itself. Careers, families, histories, losses, duty, obligation, and fear of losing control and getting hurt. It is a tale of daring to take risks, and losing control just enough to have a life, when the opportunity presents itself. When two very different worlds and strong-willed people collide, everything changes in an instant, as they confront the age-old question of whether to lay oneself bare and risk intimacy--or not.

However, as with movies and books go (as you probably know) are always better than the movie. That is hard to say about S.K. movies though because they are usually dead on with the book and follow it pretty well. It was the same with this book too, but I still enjoyed the book more than I did the movie. I think this book was not only entertaining to read, seeing how S.K. used the (fake name) Richard Bochman for his ""author"" name before he came out with his real name. So, it was entertaining in that aspect as well as a wonderful thriller. It really makes you think that there is a second person/unborn twin in all of us. It is that second voice in our head when we try to reason with ourselves or argue how we should feel about something. They sound like the same voice, but one side is like' ""you really shoudln't have done that,"" and the other side is like, ""I know but it was there and I decided to to it anyway."" So, in a way we all have a Geroge Stark in us, I just hope my inner twin, doesn't play as much of a predominate roll in my life as Stark does in Thads. I really enjoyed this book, and I can't wait to read more of S.K.'s fantasic imagination in more books to come. 
 I highly recommend this book to all S.K. lovers, and if you are new to the S.K. world of books, I recommend this book to all individuals that like thrillers, murder, and mystery of the unseen.

Then, the unspeakable: a night of chaos and carnage gives way to sunrise on a nation, and ultimately a world, forever altered. All that remains for the stunned survivors is the long fight ahead and a future ruled by fear--of darkness, of death, of a fate far worse.
As civilization swiftly crumbles into a primal landscape of predators and prey, two people flee in search of sanctuary. FBI agent Brad Wolgast is a good man haunted by what he's done in the line of duty. Six-year-old orphan Amy Harper Bellafonte is a refugee from the doomed scientific project that has triggered apocalypse. He is determined to protect her from the horror set loose by her captors. But for Amy, escaping the bloody fallout is only the beginning of a much longer odyssey--spanning miles and decades--towards the time and place where she must finish what should never have begun.
With The Passage, award-winning author Justin Cronin has written both a relentlessly suspenseful adventure and an epic chronicle of human endurance in the face of unprecedented catastrophe and unimaginable danger. Its inventive storytelling, masterful prose, and depth of human insight mark it as a crucial and transcendent work of modern fiction.

 First of all, I'd like to say that this book IS NOT about vampires. If someone tells you that there are vampires in this book, look at them and laugh. These are confused zombies that don't know what to eat. 
 Second of all, the best part of the book, for me, was when a spot of dialogue where the characters were talking about MREs. That's right - it was a 36 hour listen, and the only part I actually really enjoyed was about a minute's worth of dialogue. And when Scott Brick basically said ""the end."" That made me pretty happy, too. 
 The writing was godawful. The characters drove me nuts. The points where I was supposed to feel empathy or sympathy either made me feel like the author was attempting to manipulate me without giving me a reason to feel something, or pissed me off because of the selfishness of characters. Cronin seemed more interested in giving homage after homage to writers he enjoys, maybe to prove that he has some interest in literature, than in giving his audience a sustainable plot.

On the one hand it was another NI writer, who I'm always on the lookout for, but on the other hand it was about all the worst parts of my country's history that I'd rather forget. One thing finally decided me; this book has one foot in the supernatural. 
 Gerry Fegan is a haunted man. Literally. The ghosts of the twelve people he executed while in the IRA follow him everywhere, tormenting him and even stop him from sleeping. Gerry has been numbing himself with alcohol so he can pass out and at least get some respite from his victims, but then he comes up with a better plan; appease the ghosts. Since he was only the trigger-man, following orders, he decides to seek out those who ordered his twelve companions killed and kill them. And it works. As each person in authority is killed off, the group of ghosts gets whittled down. 
 You could read a lot into this setup; twelve people following around this guy who's willing to die for his, and the country's, sins, but I think you would have to have a really blinkered view of the world to see Fegan as any kind of saviour. The main problem I had with him is he's so unlikable. I know all writers are told to make their characters flawed, but there should still be something to connect to the reader; something that makes him sympathetic. Fegan isn't sympathetic, he's just pathetic. Even Marie, the love interest, doesn't seem to redeem him. I think he has feelings for her, but I didn't ever believe that she needed him for anything other than protection for her and her daughter Ellen (who is probably the only truly innocent character in the book). 
 At least this novel doesn't take sides. Everyone is as bad as each other. From the lowliest thug to the highest minister in parliament, everyone is deceitful, duplicitous, selfish and has no respect for human life. In one way, I suppose it's a good thing that the author doesn't take sides, but in another it's really quite depressing that there isn't anyone in this book I would consider a role model. 
 When I started writing this review I had no idea if it was going to be positive or negative. I think I've said more negative things, which isn't really fair because as a piece of writing, and as a thriller, it's pretty much top notch stuff. I think it's just too close to home for me to enjoy on a fictional level. If this story had been set in America with the mafia at its core I would probably have liked it a lot more, but since I lived through these events, using them for entertainment purposes still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 
 But that's my problem, not the novel's. Those are just the ghosts whispering in my ear.",0.0,0,108,538.9200000000001,4.99,1164,1,2,3
485,The Law Of Innocence,Michael Connelly,2020,2013,A Simon & Schuster eBook. Simon & Schuster has a great book for every reader.,Fiction,Intermediate,2,1,4,2.5,12,3.15,144,4.0,"It was at a friends recommendation that I had picked Witness the Night (You can read Reema's review here. I more or less agree with it) and liked it. Though I did feel that the ending of that book was a little abrupt but overall the content was very strong and moving. That is why when I received a request to review this book I grabbed the opportunity. 
 The blurb will remind you of the Scarlett Keeling case (you can google to know more about her). I had assumed that the book would be a rehash of that incident but I was taken by surprise when the protagonists mentions the case in the beginning and takes it as a reference point for the Liza Kay case. In fact the book becomes quite real when the protagonist Simran talks about the Delhi rape case and how it has affected her thinking. Of how she relates the disappearance of Liza with the insecurity she feels for her own daughter. 
 The book is Simran's journey of finding the truth about Liza and of getting justice for her. The book has its own flaws, there are loopholes in the investigation or the way the book wraps up but at the end of the day it is a good book to read because it shows you a murky reality. It shows us a side of Goa which is hard to believe but surely exists. It shows us a side of today's youth which is again hard to accept but sadly exists. 
 It is a good read which makes you cringe, think and contemplate. It reminds you of the horrific Delhi rape case and of the crime rampant against women. It reminds you that in this society if you are wearing a skirt you are asking for being raped!! And by smoking/ drinking etc you are actually handing over a open invitation to be raped. Mind you after all this; the truth is ""you had asked for it"". The book is very contemporary even in the terms of depicting how corruption is deeply rooted in our society & how easy it is for people with power to escape punishment for their deadliest deeds. 
 A must read if you like the genre where fiction meets reality & manages to shake you. Very few Indian authors try it and succeed so do give this a try.",0.0,0,6102,32096.52,5.26,398,5,4,4

One moment June Nealon was happily looking forward to years full of laughter and adventure with her family, and the next, she was staring into a future that was as empty as her heart. Now her life is a waiting game. Waiting for time to heal her wounds, waiting for justice. In short, waiting for a miracle to happen.

But between Shay and Claire stretches an ocean of bitter regrets, past crimes, and the rage of a mother who has lost her child.

491,Paradise Lost,J. A. Jance,2001,2003,"John Milton's Paradise Lost is one of the greatest epic poems in the English language. It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.
Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.

496,Empire Falls,Richard Russo,2001,2002,"Richard Russo--from his first novel, Mohawk, to his most recent, Straight Man--has demonstrated a peerless affinity for the human tragicomedy, and with this stunning new novel he extends even further his claims on the small-town, blue-collar heart of the country.
Dexter County, Maine, and specifically the town of Empire Falls, has seen better days, and for decades, in fact, only a succession from bad to worse. One by one, its logging and textile enterprises have gone belly-up, and the once vast holdings of the Whiting clan (presided over by the last scion's widow) now mostly amount to decrepit real estate. The working classes, meanwhile, continue to eke out whatever meager promise isn't already boarded up.
Miles Roby gazes over this ruined kingdom from the Empire Grill, an opportunity of his youth that has become the albatross of his daily and future life. Called back from college and set to work by family obligations--his mother ailing, his father a loose cannon--Miles never left home again. Even so, his own obligations are manifold: a pending divorce; a troubled younger brother; and, not least, a peculiar partnership in the failing grill with none other than Mrs. Whiting. All of these, though, are offset by his daughter, Tick, whom he guides gently and proudly through the tribulations of adolescence.
A decent man encircled by history and dreams, by echoing churches and abandoned mills, by the comforts and feuds provided by lifelong friends and neighbors, Miles is also a patient, knowing guide to the rich, hardscrabble nature of Empire Falls: fathers and sons and daughters, living and dead, rich and poor alike. Shot through with the mysteries of generations and the shattering visitations of the nation at large, it is a social novel of panoramic ambition, yet at the same time achingly personal. In the end, Empire Falls reveals our worst and best instincts, both our most appalling nightmares and our simplest hopes, with all the vision, grace and humanity of truly epic storytelling.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,14,14,14.0,12,3.91,91773,5.0,"What happens to small town when the only industry shutters its doors?

From Subhash's earliest memories, at every point, his brother was there. In the suburban streets of Calcutta where they wandered before dusk and in the hyacinth-strewn ponds where they played for hours on end, Udayan was always in his older brother's sight. So close in age, they were inseparable in childhood and yet, as the years pass - as U.S tanks roll into Vietnam and riots sweep across India - their brotherly bond can do nothing to forestall the tragedy that will upend their lives.
Udayan - charismatic and impulsive - finds himself drawn to the Naxalite movement, a rebellion waged to eradicate inequity and poverty. He will give everything, risk all, for what he believes, and in doing so will transform the futures of those dearest to him: his newly married, pregnant wife, his brother and their parents.

501,The Birth Of Venus,Sarah Dunant,2004,2003,"Sarah Dunant's gorgeous and mesmerizing novel, Birth of Venus, draws readers into a turbulent 15th-century Florence, a time when the lavish city, steeped in years of Medici family luxury, is suddenly besieged by plague, threat of invasion, and the righteous wrath of a fundamentalist monk. Dunant masterfully blends fact and fiction, seamlessly interweaving Florentine history with the coming-of-age story of a spirited 14-year-old girl. As Florence struggles in Savonarola's grip, a serial killer stalks the streets, the French invaders creep closer, and young Alessandra Cecchi must surrender her ""childish"" dreams and navigate her way into womanhood. Readers are quickly seduced by the simplicity of her unconventional passions that are more artistic than domestic: 
Dancing is one of the many things I should be good at that I am not. Unlike my sister. Plautilla can move across the floor like water and sing a stave of music like a song bird, while I, who can translate both Latin and Greek faster than she or my brothers can read it, have club feet on the dance floor and a voice like a crow. Though I swear if I were to paint the scale I could do it in a flash: shining gold leaf for the top notes falling through ochres and reds into hot purple and deepest blue.Alessandra's story, though central, is only one part of this multi-faceted and complex historical novel. Dunant paints a fascinating array of women onto her dark canvas, each representing the various fates of early Renaissance women: Alessandra's lovely (if simple) sister Plautilla is interested only in marrying rich and presiding over a household; the brave Erila, Alessandra's North African servant (and willing accomplice) has such a frank understanding of the limitations of her sex that she often escapes them; and Signora Cecchi, Alessandra's beautiful but weary mother tries to encourage yet temper the passions of her wayward daughter. A luminous and lush novel, The Birth of Venus, at its heart, is a mysterious and sensual story with razor-sharp teeth. Like Alessandra, Dunant has a painter's eye--her writing is rich and evocative, luxuriating in colors and textures of the city, the people, and the art of 15th-century Florence. Reminiscent of Tracy Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring, but with sensual splashes of color and the occasional thrill of fear, Dunant's novel is both exciting and enchanting.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,9,15,11.666666666666666,6,3.79,132,4.0,"""No one had seen her naked until her death.""

505,The House,Danielle Steel,2006,2007,"The restoration of a majestic old home provides the exhilarating backdrop for Danielle Steel's 66th bestselling novel, the story of a young woman's dream, an old man's gift, and the surprises that await us behind every closed door...
Perched on a hill overlooking San Francisco, the house was magnificent, built in 1923 by a wealthy man for the woman he adored. For her and for this house, he would spare no expense and overlook no detail, from the endless marble floors to the glittering chandeliers. Almost a century later, with the once-grand house now in disrepair, a young woman walks through its empty rooms. Sarah Anderson, a perfectly sensible estate lawyer, is about to do something utterly out of character. An elderly client has died and left her two gifts. One is a generous inheritance. The other, a priceless message: to use his money for something wonderful, something daring. And in this old house, surrounded by crumbling grandeur, Sarah knows just what it is.
A respected attorney and self-described workaholic, Sarah had always lived life by the book. With a steady, if sputtering, relationship and a tiny apartment that has suited her just fine, Sarah cannot explain the force that draws her to the mansion and its history-to the story of a woman who once lived in the house, then mysteriously left it, to a child who grew up there, and a drama that unfolded in war-torn France...and to a history she never knew she had.
Taking the biggest risk of her life, Sarah enlists the help of architect Jeff Parker, who shares Sarah's passion for bringing the exquisite old house back to life. As she and Jeff work to restore the home's every detail, as one relationship shatters and another begins, Sarah makes a series of powerful discoveries: about the true meaning of a dying man's last gift...about the extraordinary legacies that are passed from generation to generation...and about a future she's only just beginning to imagine.<
In a novel of daring and hope, of embracing life and taking chances, Danielle Steel brilliantly captures one woman's courageous choice to pour herself into a dream-and receive its gifts in return.

I am from the state of Wisconsin and was curious of how this book could represent our fine dairy state. I can say that the descriptions and the feel of Howard's daily farm life run true for dairy farmers. I was raised on a dairy farm and slipped back into my childhood where I milked cows by hand. I could smell the farm smells she was describing and I felt nostalgic for a time in the past that many people will never know or understand. To this day I have friends who are farmers who feel like Howard. Who yearn to smell the dirt, till the soil and have mannerisms much like him. 
 In my experience there is also a small mindedness in small towns as well and this story shows how this can effect and destroy families. During the course of this book the story brought up old feelings from the past and it was a hard read for me. I will say that it is well written and speaks truth of subjects most don't talk about. It shows how some people who have been wronged have a huge capacity of forgiveness and that some can't or never will forgive themselves or others. 
 This book is about being afraid to say the truth or not wanting to hear the truth. Even more it's about standing behind someone even if you don't know the truth. It shows that love can be taken for granted, felt but never shared and it can be renewed over time through the fires of life. That sometimes the people you fear the most are the ones with the saddest story. 
 Though there were times I felt it got a tad slow the overall book is very emotional and in the end I was still wondering ""is this considered a happy ending"" because all I could do was cry for Howard, Alice and Theresa. 
 I give this 4 STARS and recommend it for all readers of fiction.

 Meh. I borrowed Gone from the library due to it's intriuging cover and the fact that a friend had specifically not recommended it to me, saying I'd hate it. I decided to read it anyways, going in with a positive attitude and hoping to prove her wrong. Unfortunately, she knew me too well. 
 As I've mentioned several times in previous reviews, I love original and refreshing plots and characters. Gone lacked both of these. Knowing that the novel was about a student-teacher romance I expected high-stakes and angst but instead it was causal, bland, and boring. I ended up finding Connor's neighbours' and friends' lives more interesting than Connor's. His mother's alcoholism was random and didn't really affect the plot other than to isolate Connor from his family, which I guess may have led Connor to seek companionship in Corrina? One of the most poorly written aspects was the romance between Corinna and Connor. I didn't understand the initial attraction or the sexual tension. I thought it was really juvenile and unrealistic that they'd fall in love with each other in only a week and become so intimate so quickly. This was definitely not an accurate representation of how relationships, let alone studen-teacher relationships evolve. 
 I think Kathleen Jeffrie Johnson tried to tackle too many issues in such a short novel and it ended up as a jumble in the end. Alcoholism, death, teenage romance, sexuality, student-teacher relationships, drug abuse, loneliness, abuse, etc. are all very controversial and tough issuse to conquer individually let alone all in th same novel. I wish that Connor's thought process had been more clearly explained, for example if he had compared his relationship to Zach and Risa's and seen the differences for him and Corrina the reader might have understood why he wanted to move with her so badly. In novels like this it's so hard to write an ending that applies to each of these topics so in the end Kathleen focused on isolation (hence the title ""Gone"") which may have worked as a final chapter if there weren't so many other pressing issues and logistics left unfinished. 
 Despite not liking the overall novel there were a few points I did enjoy. I thought it was very creative to have the student-teacher romance not take place during the school year or on school property but rather in the summer, where the chances of being caught and the repurcussions were a bit different. I liked how Corinna was an average formally-troubled woman who happened to fall in love with a student as opposed to a sensual provocative woman lurring every male at school. The fact that she was as isolated and naive as Connor made her seem more like a fellow student than someone almost 10 years older than him.",0.0,0,670,3678.3,5.49,166,2,2,2

The summer that Nixon resigns, six teenagers at a summer camp for the arts become inseparable. Decades later the bond remains powerful, but so much else has changed. In The Interestings, Wolitzer follows these characters from the height of youth through middle age, as their talents, fortunes, and degrees of satisfaction diverge.
The kind of creativity that is rewarded at age fifteen is not always enough to propel someone through life at age thirty; not everyone can sustain, in adulthood, what seemed so special in adolescence. Jules Jacobson, an aspiring comic actress, eventually resigns herself to a more practical occupation and lifestyle. Her friend Jonah, a gifted musician, stops playing the guitar and becomes an engineer.

525,Black House,Stephen King and Peter Straub,2001,2002,"Black Houseis the second collaboration by Stephen King and Peter Straub, two of the most important writers in genre fiction, and the expectations of their first team-up were considerable. But despite its impressive sales, many were disappointed by The Talisman. Rather than a truly chilling epic, what we got was a rather derivative and by-the-numbers fantasy saga. So fans were reluctant to be too hopeful about their second collaboration... but we needn't have worried. Black Houseis much more like it, although even here King and Straub have not quite delivered the ultimate horror marathon--this is a psycho-thriller in the vein of Thomas Harris, but none the worse for that. And there are supernatural elements. This is the tale of a small American town held in the grip of evil. Three children have vanished, abducted by a monster called The Fisherman (after a legendary murderer) with a craving for children's flesh. Ex-detective Jack Sawyer, dealing with his own personal problems (in which he is tormented by visions of another world), is keen to stay away from the horrors of this case, recognising how bad involvement will be for him. But--guess what?--Sawyer is soon supping full on the horrors, and the reader is in for an exhilarating (and highly disturbing) experience. Jack is a powerfully realised protagonist, and his journey into the dark world of The Fisherman is genuinely unsettling. Although more of King's fingerprints are on this one than Straub's (notably the conflicted hero, struggling with his own demons), the co-authors' individual styles merge indivisibly in this highly impressive chiller. --Barry Forshaw",Fiction,Intermediate,15,1,15,7.866666666666666,15,3.99,45,4.0,"Charles Burnside brought shivers down my spine.

526,On The Beach,Nevil Shute,1957,1990,"After a nuclear World War III has destroyed most of the globe, the few remaining survivors in southern Australia await the radioactive cloud that is heading their way and bringing certain death to everyone in its path. Among them is an American submarine captain struggling to resist the knowledge that his wife and children in the United States must be dead. Then a faint Morse code signal is picked up, transmitting from somewhere near Seattle, and Captain Towers must lead his submarine crew on a bleak tour of the ruined world in a desperate search for signs of life. On the Beach is a remarkably convincing portrait of how ordinary people might face the most unimaginable nightmare.",Fiction,Intermediate,29,2,15,5.655172413793103,15,3.92,38,2.0,"On The Beach is apparently a classic and is often claimed for science fiction since it depicts a world immediately after a nuclear holocaust. The Albanians started it all off, the Egyptians then attacked NATO, and NATO thought it was the Soviets and so the nations of northern hemisphere wiped each other out in Mutually Assured Destruction. Now the last few humans, in southern Australia, pass the few months remaining to them. A lone US nuclear submarine has survived the destruction of the US and made itself available to the Royal Australian Navy. When a series of signals in Morse code - mostly unintelligible, but occasionally a clear word comes through - is detected coming from the west coast of the US, the USS Scorpion is sent to investigate. Much of the novel describes the Australians coming to terms with their impending doom - nuclear fallout is drifting south across the equator, and no one will survive when it reaches them. The USN captain pretends he still has a family back in New England, the RAN officer aboard the submarine and his wife plan for the future of their young baby, Moira, the young woman who is paired off with the USN captain, drinks and parties a lot and falls in love with the captain, and the scientist who's tracking the drift of the fallout starts racing fast cars, culminating in a fierce race in which most of the drivers die in crashes. The prose is clunky at best, though Shute draws his characters quite well. It's easy to see why the book is so well-regarded, though it wasn't as smooth a read as I'd expected. Happily, it's better than the film adaption - which starred Gregory Peck as the USN captain, Ava Gardner as Moira (as an Australian with an American accent), and Fred Astaire as the car-racing scientist.

Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls. Three times during history's darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe, becoming out of necessity even more austere and less dependent on technology and material things. And Erasmas has no fear of the outside--the Extramuros--for the last of the terrible times was long, long ago.
Now, in celebration of the week-long, once-in-a-decade rite of Apert, the fraas and suurs prepare to venture beyond the concent's gates--at the same time opening them wide to welcome the curious ""extras"" in. During his first Apert as a fraa, Erasmas eagerly anticipates reconnecting with the landmarks and family he hasn't seen since he was ""collected."" But before the week is out, both the existence he abandoned and the one he embraced will stand poised on the brink of cataclysmic change.
Powerful unforeseen forces jeopardize the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros--a threat that only an unsteady alliance of saecular and avout can oppose--as, one by one, Erasmas and his colleagues, teachers, and friends are summoned forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster.

The first 300 pages were very powerful, in fact the first three chapters are for me some of the very best I have ever read,but the latter 300 were less so seeming to rather peter out. 
 The opening chapters details Rosie's abuse at the hands of her husband Norman Daniels and are pretty horrific so it is easy to like and feel for her. That said the best character for me is that of Norman. Norman is a police officer and seen by the public as a hero but in private is a psychotic monster who is slowly losing his mind.(Although for me this too was a little overdone in the end). 
 Rosie takes Norman's credit card and escapes from his clutches but Norman is not about to give her up and comes looking for her. Rosie visits a pawn shop and spots a painting which grabs her attention and seems to want her as much as she wants it. At home Rosie escapes into another world via the painting. 
 It is this part of the story which rather lost it for me.

536,The Birth Of Venus,Sarah Dunant,2004,2003,"Sarah Dunant's gorgeous and mesmerizing novel, Birth of Venus, draws readers into a turbulent 15th-century Florence, a time when the lavish city, steeped in years of Medici family luxury, is suddenly besieged by plague, threat of invasion, and the righteous wrath of a fundamentalist monk. Dunant masterfully blends fact and fiction, seamlessly interweaving Florentine history with the coming-of-age story of a spirited 14-year-old girl. As Florence struggles in Savonarola's grip, a serial killer stalks the streets, the French invaders creep closer, and young Alessandra Cecchi must surrender her ""childish"" dreams and navigate her way into womanhood. Readers are quickly seduced by the simplicity of her unconventional passions that are more artistic than domestic: 
Dancing is one of the many things I should be good at that I am not. Unlike my sister. Plautilla can move across the floor like water and sing a stave of music like a song bird, while I, who can translate both Latin and Greek faster than she or my brothers can read it, have club feet on the dance floor and a voice like a crow. Though I swear if I were to paint the scale I could do it in a flash: shining gold leaf for the top notes falling through ochres and reds into hot purple and deepest blue.Alessandra's story, though central, is only one part of this multi-faceted and complex historical novel. Dunant paints a fascinating array of women onto her dark canvas, each representing the various fates of early Renaissance women: Alessandra's lovely (if simple) sister Plautilla is interested only in marrying rich and presiding over a household; the brave Erila, Alessandra's North African servant (and willing accomplice) has such a frank understanding of the limitations of her sex that she often escapes them; and Signora Cecchi, Alessandra's beautiful but weary mother tries to encourage yet temper the passions of her wayward daughter. A luminous and lush novel, The Birth of Venus, at its heart, is a mysterious and sensual story with razor-sharp teeth. Like Alessandra, Dunant has a painter's eye--her writing is rich and evocative, luxuriating in colors and textures of the city, the people, and the art of 15th-century Florence. Reminiscent of Tracy Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring, but with sensual splashes of color and the occasional thrill of fear, Dunant's novel is both exciting and enchanting.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,9,15,11.666666666666666,6,3.79,132,5.0,A story that grabs your attention in the last paragraph of the first chapter (maybe it was the prologue).

Suddenly, she finds herself planning a wedding at her parents' Bel Air home.
As preparations begin, the chaos of last-minute arrangements, surprise announcements and ever-increasing anxiety brings out both the best and the worst in everyone.

It is really a whirlwind of a book, one major event after another just keeps on happening to Allegra, her family, or one of her clients (Allegra is an entertaiment attorney). It is rather fast paced for the most part, which to me, is pretty typical for a DS novel. I have to say, so much of this is rather unrealistic, the fact that so many major things keep happening, no one person in real life could possibly have all these kinds of things going on in their life.

It happened on a tree-lined street in Notting Hill to a woman who seemed to have the perfect life. Ellie Lerner's best friend, Lucy, was murdered in front of her young daughter. And, as best friends do, Ellie dropped everything--her marriage, her job, her life in the Boston suburbs--to travel to London and pick up the pieces of Lucy's life. While Lucy's husband, Greg, copes with his grief by retreating into himself, eight-year-old Sophie has simply stopped speaking.

Sam and Clementine have a wonderful, albeit, busy life: they have two little girls, Sam has just started a new dream job, and Clementine, a cellist, is busy preparing for the audition of a lifetime. If there's anything they can count on, it's each other.
Clementine and Erika are each other's oldest friends. A single look between them can convey an entire conversation. But theirs is a complicated relationship, so when Erika mentions a last minute invitation to a barbecue with her neighbors, Tiffany and Vid, Clementine and Sam don't hesitate. Having Tiffany and Vid's larger than life personalities there will be a welcome respite.
Two months later, it won't stop raining, and Clementine and Sam can't stop asking themselves the question: What if we hadn't gone?
In Truly Madly Guilty, Liane Moriarty takes on the foundations of our lives: marriage, sex, parenthood, and friendship. She shows how guilt can expose the fault lines in the most seemingly strong relationships, how what we don't say can be more powerful than what we do, and how sometimes it is the most innocent of moments that can do the greatest harm.",Fiction,Intermediate,8,1,15,5.875,7,3.55,102777,3.0,"The intrigue was there, for sure.

When the body of a young heiress is found within the Royal College of Surgeons, Detective Sergeant Jamie Brooke is assigned to the case. An antique ivory figurine found beside the body is the only lead and she enlists Blake Daniel, a reluctant clairvoyant, to help her discover the message it holds.
When personal tragedy strikes, Jamie has nothing left to lose and she must race against time to stop the mysterious Lyceum claiming another victim.
As Jamie and Blake delve into a macabre world of grave robbery, body modification, and the genetic engineering of monsters, they must fight to keep their sanity, and their lives.

A supernatural element is introduced as she meets a man who can remember strong emotional moments in the life of an inanimate object just by touching it. The crime itself is graphic, but the clues leading to it's solving are far more so, involving the vivisection of children and adults, both dead and alive when the process begins. If you have a weak stomach, it may be best to pass this one by. If you aren't squeemish, though, it's a great adventure with well-rounded characters.

But 'here' turns out to be a cavernous and ornate old theater where they are utterly isolated from the outside world - and where heat and power and, most importantly, food are in increasingly short supply.

When Anders Eckman, a mild-mannered lab researcher, is sent to investigate, a curt letter reporting his death is all that returns.

The character of Dr Swenson, who is in charge of a research operation gone rogue in a remote tributary of the Rio Negro, a Captain Kurtz of sorts, has got to be the crabbiest I have come across in a novel. The type who is both patronizing and condescending to everyone, she is so unpleasant to be around I wonder how her fellow research scientists tolerate her out in the jungle. Swenson orders protagonist Marina Singh to be her personal attendant, refusing to let her leave. She lies to the pharma company CEO who has been funding her operations for years without any news. While Kurtz had the authority and grudging respect of the natives around him, Swenson had neither. State of Wonder mirrors Heart of Darkness pretty closely, right down to the arrows fired from unseen cannibals at the river's edge, although this time the story ends well, Marina managing to beat back the horrors of the jungle and return to the comforts of Minnesota.

570,The Brethren,John Grisham,2000,2010,"Penguin Readers Level 5, Book/CD pack.
John Grisham's novels have all been so systematically successful that it is easy to forget he is just one man toiling away silently with a pen, experimenting and improving with each book. While not as gifted a prose stylist as Scott Turow, Grisham is among the best plotters in the thriller business, and he infuses his books with a moral valence and creative vision that set them apart from their peers.The Brethrenis in many respects his most daring book yet. The novel grows from two separate subplots. In the first, three imprisoned ex-judges (the ""brethren"" in the title), frustrated by their loss of power and influence, concoct an elaborate blackmail scheme that preys on wealthy, closeted gay men. The second story traces the rise of presidential candidate Aaron Lake, a puppet essentially created by CIA director Teddy Maynard to fulfill Maynard's plans for restoring the power of his beleaguered agency. 
Grisham's tight control of the two meandering threads leaves the reader guessing through most of the opening chapters how and when these two worlds will collide. Also impressive is Grisham's careful portraiture. Justice Hatlee Beech in particular is a fascinating, tragic anti-hero: a millionaire judge with an appointment for life who was rendered divorced, bankrupt, and friendless after his conviction for a drunk-driving homicide.
The book's cynical view of presidential politics and criminal justice casts a somewhat gloomy shadow over the tale. CIA director Teddy Maynard is an all-powerful demon with absolute knowledge and control of the public will and public funds. Even his candidate, Congressman Lake, is a pawn in Maynard's egomaniacal game of ad campaigns, illicit contributions, and international intrigue. In the end, The Brethrenmarks a transition in Grisham's career toward a more thoughtful narrative style with less interest in the big-payoff blockbuster ending. But that's not to say that the last 50 pages won't keep your reading light turned on late. --Patrick O'Kelley",Fiction,Intermediate,31,1,16,5.903225806451613,3,3.72,26,0.0,* Inherited from Mum's shelves.,0.0,0,34992,279586.08,7.99,820,5,3,3

What causes Jack's inexplicable waking dreams, if that is what they are, of robins' eggs and red feathers? It's almost as if someone is trying to tell him something. As that message becomes increasingly impossible to ignore, Jack is drawn back to the Territories and to his own hidden past, where he may find the soul-strength to enter a terrifying house at the end of a deserted track of forest, there to encounter the obscene and ferocious evils sheltered within it.

Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls. Three times during history's darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe, becoming out of necessity even more austere and less dependent on technology and material things. And Erasmas has no fear of the outside--the Extramuros--for the last of the terrible times was long, long ago.
Now, in celebration of the week-long, once-in-a-decade rite of Apert, the fraas and suurs prepare to venture beyond the concent's gates--at the same time opening them wide to welcome the curious ""extras"" in. During his first Apert as a fraa, Erasmas eagerly anticipates reconnecting with the landmarks and family he hasn't seen since he was ""collected."" But before the week is out, both the existence he abandoned and the one he embraced will stand poised on the brink of cataclysmic change.
Powerful unforeseen forces jeopardize the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros--a threat that only an unsteady alliance of saecular and avout can oppose--as, one by one, Erasmas and his colleagues, teachers, and friends are summoned forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster.

It expounds on the problems that stem from the government providing relief to many needy categories of people and institutions and this always takes away from, and is ultimately paid for by, the everyday working man and woman.

Pada usia 45 tahun, Adrienne Willis mesti menata kembali hidupnya setelah suaminya meninggalkannya untuk wanita yang lebih muda. Masih dengan kesedihan mendalam, ia menerima tawaran seorang teman untuk menjaga penginapan di Rodanthe, kota pantai kecil di Carolina Utara.
Ketika badai besar mengarah ke kota itu, tampaknya Adrienne akan terisolasi di sana, namun ternyata ada seorang tamu yang datang. Paul Flanner. Paul, dokter berusia 54 tahun, telah menjual prakteknya dan datang ke Rodanthe untuk berdamai dengan dirinya dan masa lalunya. Dua orang yang sama-sama ""terluka"" ini menemukan penghiburan satu sama lain, dan kebersamaan pada satu akhir minggu itu mengubah banyak hal dalam hidup mereka.",Fiction,Intermediate,11,1,15,7.454545454545454,11,3.82,55,4.0,"Ketika anak perempuannya depresi karena kehilangan sesorang, Adrienne Willis memutuskan ini adalah saat yang tepat untuk bercerita tentang rahasia yang selama ini ia simpan rapat-rapat. 
 Cerita ini berawal di sebuah hari di tahun 1988. Setelah suaminya meninggalkan Adrienne demi perempuan lain, kehidupan Adrienne menjadi kacau. Anak-anak yang frustasi, Ayah yang sakit dan keuangan yang mencekik membuat Adrienne menerima tawaran Jean, temannya, untuk menjaga penginapan kecil di kota kecil, Rodanthe. Jean memberitahukan bahwa akan ada seorang tamu lelaki bernama Paul Flanner yang akan tinggal di penginapan tersebut selama Jane pergi, karena itu ia meminta tolong Adrienne menjaga dan mengurus penginapan. 
 Pertemuan Adrienne dengan Paul ternyata membawa keduanya ke cinta yang selama ini dirindukan. Pernikahan masing-masing yang berakhir dengan kacau pada awalnya membuat mereka berdua khawatir. But love is strong, of course. Mereka jatuh hati dan memutuskan menjalani cinta itu selama mereka memiliki waktu di penginapan, sebab Paul telah mengatur jadwal untuk memperbaiki hubungan dengan anaknya di Ecuador. Dan Adrienne mengizinkan Paul pergi untuk kembali lagi setahun kemudian. 
 Sparks dengan pandai mengemas berbagai bentuk cinta dalam buku ini. Penokohan yang kuat dan karakter 'tak sempurna' yang dihadirkan juga memberi warna pada kisah percintaan Adrienne dan Paul. Kehilangan tentunya adalah sebuah pemicu yang baik bagi seseorang untuk berkisah, mengenang masa lalu atau merencanakan masa depan, dan itu yang dihadirkan Sparks lewat malam-malam di Rodanthe. 
 Kisah romantis yang tidak berlebihan memang sudah menjadi ciri khas Sparks, tentunya dengan akhir cerita yang membuat pembacanya labil memutuskan apakah ini happy ending atau sad ending. Meski diceritakan dengan alur yang lambat, tapi Sparks dengan baik mampu membawa romansa yang terjadi di penginapan terceritakan dengan baik sehingga tidak membuat pembaca bosan. Penyampaian jalan cerita juga diceritakan secara bergantian, kadang mundur mengisahkan Adrienne dan Paul, tetapi sesekali dibiarkan maju ke masa sekarang ketika Adrienne bercerita pada Amanda, anaknya. 
 Nights in Rodanthe bahkan telah difilmkan pada tahun 2008 dengan Diane Lane sebagai Adrienne dan Richard Gere sebagai Paul Flanner. Sayangnya banyak kritik buruk yang diberikan pada filmnya, padahal pada novelnya mendapat sambutan yang baik. 
 Sebuah kisah kehidupan yang emosional, kisah romantis yang disampaikan dengan indah, kekuatan kehilangan, cinta dan kesabaran, tulus kasih dan rasa sayang, semua hal dalam buku ini membuat saya rela memberikan 4 bintang.

She is an actress, he soon learns, an American starlet, and she is dying.
And the story begins again today, half a world away, when an elderly Italian man shows up on a movie studio's back lot--searching for the mysterious woman he last saw at his hotel decades earlier.
What unfolds is a dazzling, yet deeply human, roller coaster of a novel, spanning fifty years and nearly as many lives.

Carl Streator is a solitary widower and a fortyish newspaper reporter who is assigned to do a series of articles on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. In the course of this investigation he discovers an ominous thread: the presence at the death scenes of the anthology Poems and Rhymes Around the World, all opened to the page where there appears an African chant, or ""culling song."" This song turns out to be lethal when spoken or even thoughtin anyone's direction - and once it lodges in Streator's brain he finds himself becoming an involuntary serial killer. So he teams up with a real estate broker, one Helen Hoover Boyle - who specializes in selling haunted houses and who lost a child to the culling song years before - for a cross-country odyssey to remove all copies of the book from libraries, lest this deadly verbal virus spread and wipe out human life. Accompanying them on this road trip are Helen's assistant, Mona Sabbat, an exquisitely earnest Wiccan, and her sardonic ecoterrorist boyfriend Oyster, who is running a scam involving fake liability claims and business blackmail. Welcome to the new nuclear family.
On one level, Lullabyis a chillingly pertinent parable about the dangers of psychic infection and control in an era of wildly overproliferated information: ""Imagine a plague you catch through your ears... imagine an idea thatoccupies your mind like a city.""

The boy in the boat stands for every reader and every child. Billy Collins is the author of a dozen books of poetry and was called America's most popular poet by the New York Times. He served as U.

When he can no longer see land, the boat turns into a book which he starts to read. When he finishes the book, he becomes the book. The moon looks down as the boy returns to shore with his boat and his book. 
 Collins offers children a book that truly introduces them to poetry. This is a book that asks children to stretch and understand that there is more to the story than is right on the page in the words. The poem is about reading, about journeys, about wonder and the way that books can inspire and change us. That is not there on the page, and yet it is there if you look for it. This is a great book to introduce children to deeper poetry and how it too is dazzling. 
 Romagna's illustrations take a literal look at the poem, offering images of what the words are depicting and also hinting at the depths behind them as well. Filled with moments of whimsy with a friendly moon and a blowing cloud with a face, the illustrations are friendly and celebratory.

Luminous, haunting, unforgettable, The Age of Miraclesis a stunning fiction debut by a superb new writer, a story about coming of age during extraordinary times, about people going on with their lives in an era of profound uncertainty.
On a seemingly ordinary Saturday in a California suburb, 11-year-old Julia and her family awake to discover, along with the rest of the world, that the rotation of the earth has suddenly begun to slow. The days and nights grow longer and longer, gravity is affected, the environment is thrown into disarray. Yet as she struggles to navigate an ever-shifting landscape, Julia is also coping with the normal disasters of everyday life--the fissures in her parents' marriage, the loss of old friends, the hopeful anguish of first love, the bizarre behavior of her grandfather who, convinced of a government conspiracy, spends his days obsessively cataloging his possessions. As Julia adjusts to the new normal, the slowing inexorably continues.
With spare, graceful prose and the emotional wisdom of a born storyteller, Karen Thompson Walker has created a singular narrator in Julia, a resilient and insightful young girl, and a moving portrait of family life set against the backdrop of an utterly altered world.",Fiction,Intermediate,2,6,10,8.0,1,3.64,61891,2.0,"Ok will be the bad guy here, I really disliked this book. I finished it, which isn't saying much since I listened to it and it was only nine hours long. 
 The narrator read the book very slow. Now that could be due to the theme of the book, but at times it made it impossible to listen to. 
 The only reason I picked up this book is because of a heated discussion on a listserve for school and youth librarians. Some of the group was so inspired by the book they thought it would be great for sixth grade readers. Others felt the readers wouldn't be able connect because it was an adult looking back at that time. I would have to agree with the second group. 
 At first I thought the book was going in an interesting and new way. Then it kind of dragged on, like the slowing of their days. 
 After nine hours of the book, I had no hope. The future was so bleak and hopeless I didn't really want to tackle another book, thankfully I selected a book type I really enjoy to follow it.

625,The Cider House Rules,John Irving,1985,1994,"Librarian's note: Alternate cover edition of ISBN13 9780345387653.
First published in 1985 by William Morrow, The Cider House Rules is John Irving's sixth novel. Set in rural Maine in the first half of the twentieth century, it tells the story of Dr. Wilbur Larch--saint and obstetrician, founder and director of the orphanage in the town of St. Cloud's, ether addict and abortionist. It is also the story of Dr. Larch's favorite orphan, Homer Wells, who is never adopted.",Fiction,Intermediate,21,1,14,5.761904761904762,6,4.1,128,5.0,"I knew going in that a central theme of ""Cider House Rules"" is abortion. What I wasn't expecting was how utterly non-didactic the novel is: Irving doesn't want to convince you to think of this issue in any one way. He wants to show you what different people with different experiences and baggage think about it, so that in turn, you can refine the way you look at this very complicated issue. Regardless of your stance, you will learn something about how the other side feels. This is what a great novel does: it opens your mind and your heart, it creates compassion for something you never thought of and it makes you look at the world in a slightly different way. 
 This was my first John Irving novel and I now completely understand why he is sometimes referred to as the American Dickens. His characters are ordinary people who have extraordinary lives. And in this book, the characters have the same sort of wonderfully quirky names that I would expect from good old Charlie! The story of every one of them is so lovingly drawn that you feel as close to them as if they were members of your family by the end of the book. They are all lovably flawed, sometimes foolish and sometimes selfless but always viscerally human. Irving somehow makes them feel more real than some actual people I know. 
 Dr. Wilbur Larch delivers babies, but he also delivers mothers: having seen desperate young women die because of the lack of legally available medical assistance, he is the pro-choice character who will not hesitate to defy the law to save women. Homer Wells is an orphan of the St. Clouds orphanage where Dr. Larch works. He was never adopted, and as he grew up, was progressively groomed by the doctor to be his successor. But one day he realizes that, as an unwanted child who never knew his mother, he would have ended up as one more scraped foetus had abortion been legal. He is, understandably, pro-life and refuses to perform abortions, even if he believes they should be legal. One day, a young couple comes to St. Clouds to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, and as they leave to go back to their little coastal town, Homer decides to go with them to see what else there is in the world besides his small orphanage and finds himself working in an apple orchard. In this orchard, he will learn many things about love, life, friendship and that sometimes doing bad things for good reasons is not a crime. 
 Of course, there is so much more to it that I can reasonably summarize in a Goodreads review. The prose is rich, almost musical in its cadence and a bittersweet humour brightens what could have been a very gloomy setting. I know some readers might get exasperated by the whole ""In other parts of the world, XYZ; here in St. Clouds..."" but I absolutely loved it. It gave the book this old-fashioned storytelling vibe that made me feel warm and cosy in a way only the very best stories can accomplish. I've come to think of this novel as that warm, spicy mug of mulled wine I like to sit with on cold fall evenings: it's comforting and seems to warm me up from the inside out. While abortion is an important topic in this story, it's a mistake to think that this is all the book is about. ""The Cider House Rules"" is about family - in every possible meaning of the word - choices, the living by and breaking of rules, inclusion, growing up... Just like a very good classic, you will find new things to think about every time you pick it up. 
 It's a beautifully written and deeply moving novel that I recommend to everyone. The movie is sweet but I feel like it fails to capture the depth of the characters and the multiple layers of meaning of their story (not to mention that the last third of the story is butchered). If you've only ever seen the film and enjoyed it, give the book a chance.",1.0,0,570,1134.3,1.99,186,2,4,4

David Mitchell is an eloquent conjurer of intricate, interconnected tales, a genre-bending daredevil, and a master prose stylist. Rich with character and realms of possibility, The Bone Clocksis a hypnotic puzzle of a novel that makes you want to take it apart and and put back together the very moment you reach the final page.
Following a scalding row with her mother, fifteen-year-old Holly Sykes slams the door on her old life. But Holly is no typical teenage runaway: a sensitive child once contacted by voices she knew only as ""the radio people,"" Holly is a lightning rod for psychic phenomena. Now, as she wanders deeper into the English countryside, visions and coincidences reorder her reality until they assume the aura of a nightmare brought to life.
For Holly has caught the attention of a cabal of dangerous mystics--and their enemies. But her lost weekend is merely the prelude to a shocking disappearance that leaves her family irrevocably scarred. This unsolved mystery will echo through every decade of Holly's life, affecting all the people Holly loves--even the ones who are not yet born.

(I've written about this before.) When Cloud Atlas came out in cinemas and everyone raved about it, I found out David Mitchell exists and promptly began reading Ghostwritten. Which was great. I then allowed myself to go with the crowd for Cloud Atlas and found it very good, if slightly tiring and self-aware in parts. With this extensive sample of two books, I was firmly on Mitchell's side, praising his skilled blend of believable, well-written characters and insidious magical realism. 
 Well, The Bone Clocks took it down a (serious) notch. Mitchell doesn't miss a beat when switching voices from a rebellious, know-it-all teenage girl to a self-important Cambridge student or a war correspondent torn between family and work. And these lifelike, well-developed characters pull you into their (particular, but surely not miraculous or exceptional) stories. And you read on, and you get invested, and you pick favorites, and then... 
 BAM! Here comes the magical/mystical/""the truth is out there"" plot, thrown in with a heavy hand, excruciatingly long monologues and enough made-up words to send Rowling and Tolkien spinning. The ""skilled blend"" I was in awe of? Totally gone; about a quarter of the book is a predictable mess of the good guys and the bad guys battling it out for people's souls, and that quarter is thrown is apparently random and then almost never touched on for the rest of the book. (Another quarter of the book is not an epilogue. If you want the mystical... stuff to be the main plot, end with it.) 
 What saddens me the most is that I really, really enjoyed the realistic parts. Mitchell can write, but I think he might have gotten caught in his own spiel.",0.0,0,2862,19805.04,6.92,1001,2,2,2

In the afterword he mentions that Charlie isn't based on his daughter but that his daughter allowed Charlie to be herself and that's apparent in the way he writes her. Really well done, although for fans of King, knowing he can write the stuffing out of a kid isn't that surprising, so it was the tenderness of the relationship that took me off guard and made me appreciate this book so much. It was a nice switch from the usual parent/child stuff he does (ahem Pet Semetary, Delores Cliaborne, The Talisman, etc.) 
 That being said, about half or two thirds of the way through (it's so hard to tell on an eReader) Andy and Charlie don't always appear together and it lost some of it's magic. The villains are compelling and the intrigue of the government agency worked to keep the pages turning, but I confess that I found Charlie and Andy both less interesting without the other. The climax is one of King's best so the last 20% or so it regained it's page turner (or clicker) status and I put it down feeling very satisfied and pleased that I'd read this old school King at last. 
 I'd recommend this book to pretty much anyone, there's no real horror and it's about as sci-fi as Quantum Leap, so don't let the author or subject matter put you off. It's ultimately, like so much Stephen King, an examination of childhood, the loss of innocence, and the power of the individual.

 I did perhaps give to much away, but the plot is generally well-known, if only because of the horror film of the same name. 
 As for the book, I have to say that the writing wasn't that good. Descriptions of the characters and places is rare, taking away from the novel's depth; and the expression is fairly commonplace, Levin is telling you a story, but he doesn't care if you live the story or not. Other than that, this is a good book. The plot is interesting, so is the dialogue (the focus on the dialogue and not the setting is to be expected from a playwright), and the denouement is excellent. I would only add that the ending proved comical instead of frightening (and I was reading it before bed!), but a book is not only defined by its ending.

It's there that he meets Paradise, a young woman who witnessed her father murder her family and barely escaped his hand. Diagnosed with schizophrenia, Paradise may also have an extrasensory gift: the ability to experience the final moments of a person's life when she touches the dead body.
In a desperate attempt to find the killer, Raines enlists Paradise's help. In an effort to win her trust, he befriends this strange young woman and begins to see in her qualities that most 'sane people' sorely lack. Gradually, he starts to question whether sanity resides outside the hospital walls...or inside.
As the Bride Collector picks up the pace-and volume-of his gruesome crucifixions, the case becomes even more personal to Raines when his friend and colleague, a beautiful young forensic psychologist, becomes the Bride Collector's next target.

On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless - mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky 12-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the ""steam"" that children with the ""shining"" produce when they are slowly tortured to death.
Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant ""shining"" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying.

There must be more vivid world-building going on than it initially seemed was happening, because I'm still here. 
 I always thought Auri was by far the most interesting character, so I'm glad to see her developed so much more in this little diversionary novella. I really like her view of the world, though we still don't know her backstory, except for a couple of glimpses. A rape, apparently. 
 But there are a number of things you have to get past to enjoy this book. First the handwringing and gratuitous explanation in the foreword or introduction or whatever it was. Ridiculous because so what if it's a slice-of-life story. Rothfuss seems compelled to tell us that this does not have a conventional story structure... maybe not, for genre, but if he were more widely read, he'd know better. 
 Then, there are a few writing basics he has to work on. Lie, lay, and laid are used incorrectly in pretty much every instance. And there are dangling modifiers... Just messy. 
 Also, Auri needs Kvothe for protection/rescue it seems. Though it appears she may rescue him at some point. In the meantime, she seems overly dependent on his regard and connection to her. This would be fine if we hadn't already had it up to here with Kvothe. 
 And then we have more handwringing at the end, about how this really isn't a conventional story, but all his friends and his editor really liked it, so it must be good. 
 PR could have more respect for his readers, it seems to me. I think it's around 2.5 stars, but Auri and her world are compelling enough for me to bump it up rather than down. It's a pretty good exploration of OCD, if nothing else.",0.0,0,4240,16917.600000000002,3.99,1156,4,3,3

Mengingatkan saya pada Habiburahman El-Shirazy yang juga mempunyai identitas tertentu baik dari segi tema, ending, atau pernak-pernik lainnya di dalam novelnya. Namun, hal ini sama sekali tak membuat saya bosan dengan Om Nico (sok akrab banget!). 
 Kesukaan saya pada cerita-cerita yang bersetting di pinggiran laut (tetapi nggak buat FTV yang syutingnya selalu di Bali itu, hehehe), membuat saya dengan mudah menambatkan rasa cinta pada novel ini. Apalagi penggambaran persiapan sebelum badai melanda yang digarap begitu detil benar-benar membuat saya terasa hanyut dalam momen-momen tersebut. Selain itu, hubungan antara anak dan orang tua (dalam novel ini antara Adrienne dan ayahnya yang menderita stroke, juga keretakan hubungan Paul dan anaknya) selalu berhasil membuat saya terenyuh, bahkan menitikkan air mata. Dan juga, walaupun ide tentang kematian kekasih hati telah diangkat berjuta-juta kali dalam novel maupun film, dan Om Nico juga nggak sekali ini mengambil ide tersebut untuk novel-novelnya, namun kisah berbumbu kehilangan ini tetap saja nikmat. Terutama karena gaya bahasa Om Nico (yang walaupun terkenal dengan penjabaran sepanjang Sungai Nil) yang amat indah dan membuai. 
 But, tentu saja, lagi-lagi surat-surat untuk Paul kepada Adrienne adalah part terbaik dari novel ini. Surat-surat buatan Om Nico selalu penuh makna dan romantis (referensi lain Message in the Bottle dan Dear John). 
 Begitu banyak yang kuharapkan hari-hari ini, tapi yang terutama, aku berharap seandainya kau berada di sini. Sungguh aneh, tapi sebelum aku mengenalmu, aku tak ingat kapan terakhir kalinya aku menangis. Sekarang, sepertinya air mata begitu mudah datang... tapi kau punya cara yang bisa membuat kesedihanku menjadi bermanfaat, dan menjelaskan segala hal sedemikian rupa sehingga mengurangi kepedihanku. Kau hadiah yang begitu berharga, dan saat kita bersama lagi, aku akan memelukmu hingga lenganku lemah dan tak sanggup memelukmu lagi. Kadang-kadang, ingatan akan dirimu adalah satu-satunya yang membuatku terus bertahan. 
 Dan, baiklah, saatnya review yang begitu panjang ini diakhiri. Untuk penikmat novel remaja, saya nggak merekomendasikan novel ini untuk dibaca karena saya sendiri masih bingung bagaimana saya bisa menikmati kisah cinta orang tuwir (secara harafiah) yang usianya masing-masing 45 dan 54 tahun?

Their newest mission is no walk in the clouds. In an effort to seek out troubled teens, they, along with fellow angels, Rafe, Sophie and Gabriel, will pose as a family of adopted brothers and sisters and enroll in high school. Along with their gift of ""emotional divination"", which is to take on the pain of those who are suffering, they experience their own roller coaster rides of teenage emotions.

 3.5 Stars! 
 With plenty of emotions and angst, The Guardians sets itself apart as a paranormal angel book without the whole excessive ""pure"" mojo becoming burdensome and tons of human like emotions for our ""angelic"" characters. 
 After witnessing the murder of a pivotal mother, Victoria, among several families, several angels, including Elijah and Cassie, are sent on a mission to prevent several of the mother's family members from going off the bridge to the bad stuff. The job's tough, but someone has to prevent these multiple children from being manipulated by Lucius, the malevolent presence responsible for Victoria's death who is out for more blood. 
 The guardian angels are sent down to earth in human bodies to make themselves behave like real humans for the sake of fitting in, so the angels are not immune to the effects of human emotions. These emotions make the angels relatable protagonists, despite their job title as ""angel."" This feels somewhat out of place with all of the jealousy, pride, and anger that comes along with the title of being a ""guardian angel."" In some ways, this is more like a book about two people developing feelings for people who lack the necessary ability to go far in life without some support. Unfortunately, they fall in love with these hopeless people, and then the soap operas come in. *dun, dun, dun* (No, actually it's a good thing) 
 There are few angel books that take risks like The Guardians does. Instead of focusing on ""cleansing"" the souls of these poor humans, the angels serve as guards for the kids recovering from the empty spot Victoria left in their lives. However, many elements of the plot and aspects of the world are left unexplained that leaves the reader confused at times, and wondering why all of this couldn't be solved as easily as it is at the end. Every scene seems to be a climatic moment, even if it is not the vital to the story line. Whether or not that is a bad thing, I still have yet to decide, but overall, it feels as if there's no true plot line. Instead, it feels more like a group of TV episode summaries bunched together, with a new situation and climatic moment every few chapters. 
 Many of the characters of The Guardians vacillate from brimming with emotion to drowning to one-sided characters with no personality. For example, Elijah and Cassie are hormone-crazy angels in teenager bodies. It's endearing in that they have to experience what every human's forced to face, but a little odd to see these angelic creatures easily adjusted to the sinful nature that humans have. It seems questionable that the main angel characters are the ones with all of the problems, while the other three; Rafe, Sophie, and Gabriel, aren't really developed as characters and act like the angelic creatures they are. Nothing is wrong with this, in fact, it makes The Guardians stand out as a book. Meanwhile, the assignments; Abby and Zach, are somewhat undervalued. Rather than being seen as teenagers who suffer as all teenagers do, they are portrayed as nearly perfect humans with terrible circumstances awaiting them. Abby is Miss. Goody-Two Shoes, even when she finds out that she and baby can't be together. Zach is like the Hulk, a sweet guy with an untested rage just dying to be unleashed. Overall, the characters weren't exactly the best selection to be found, but they were enjoyable to read about. 
 The Guardians is a sweet, enjoyable read due to its easy nature and real-life problems among teenagers. Despite all of the angel talk, there is no other book that has many of the soap opera problems that teenagers must face in a realistic manner, way more realistically than dramas. At first, I was thinking this book would be like Halo by Alexandra Adornetto, which was one of the stupidest books ever written in the history of YA kind, but actually, this book succeeds in everything Halo couldn't possible imagine. The ending was a little rushed in my opinion, and needed work because of its approach, which could've been achieved earlier in the book to save many characters much grief. Regardless, with a plot accented with twists and a group of multi-faceted characters, The Guardians shows itself as a great start for what I hope to be a wonderful new paranormal angel series.

Challenger claims to have found a remarkable land in South America where prehistoric creatures still live. The only trouble is, no-one believes him. That is until our narrator, journalist Malone, gets involved. Soon Malone finds himself on an expedition with Challenger to prove the story, along with rival Professor Summerlee and a soldier. 
 Oddly I thought the set-up was better than the Lost World portion. Challenger is a great character, a genius who knows it and hates all other human life. He's like an academic Scrooge. 
 Much of the story sees the expedition visiting the Lost World and it is fairly enjoyable, if a little descriptive. A great deal of time is spent describing the landscape and its inhabitants which is enjoyable but as a reader I was keen for something to happen. Eventually it does as the team are pit against a colony of proto-humans, the ""missing link"" as they say. 
 Its interesting reading this from a modern perspective. Considering its age the science here isn't too bad. Its a fiction story after all and actually whilst a lost world is now unlikely it is not implausible that some form of early humans still exist in a remote part of the world. 
 There was very much of an imperialistic feel to the book and the characters attitudes to the 'ape-men'. They pretty much want to destroy them whilst a modern scientist would strive to preserve them. Whilst I felt a little uncomfortable about the characters actions it is important to remember the context of when the book was written. 
 All in all, very enjoyable. It has the great narration of the Sherlock Holmes story but is more of a fantasy story & more character-driven. There was also a great sense of fun with some amusing moments which doesn't happen so much in Sherlock Holmes. A good story from an author who deserves to be remembered for more than Sherlock Holmes.",1.0,0,55728,556722.72,9.99,658,5,5,4
649,The Art Of Fielding,Chad Harbach,2011,2011,"The Art of Fielding is an expansive, warmhearted novel about ambition and its limits, about family and friendship and love, and about commitment - to oneself and to others.
At Westish College, a small school on the shore of Lake Michigan, baseball star Henry Skrimshander seems destined for big league stardom. But when a routine throw goes disastrously off course, the fates of five people are upended.
Henry's fight against self-doubt threatens to ruin his future. College president Guert Affenlight, a longtime bachelor, has fallen unexpectedly and helplessly in love. Owen Dunne, Henry's gay roommate and teammate, becomes caught up in a dangerous affair. Mike Schwartz, the Harpooners' team captain and Henry's best friend, realizes he has guided Henry's career at the expense of his own. And Pella Affenlight, Guert's daughter, returns to Westish after escaping an ill-fated marriage, determined to start a new life.
As the season counts down to its climactic final game, these five are forced to confront their deepest hopes, anxieties, and secrets. In the process they forge new bonds, and help one another find their true paths.

The characters were more than memorable--they were a bunch of people I'd love to call friends. Meditations on many things, baseball, relationships, etc, were fairly transcendent. Loved the focus on Melville. Would have liked a little more word play throughout (lovely turns of phrase fade after the first 1/3 of the book) and a bit more love for the Northwoods from the narrator (the narrator seems obsessed with cold and dreariness in WI--which is a lot of the experience, but certainly not all).

Flight Behavior transfixes from its opening scene, when a young woman's narrow experience of life is thrown wide with the force of a raging fire. In the lyrical language of her native Appalachia, Barbara Kingsolver bares the rich, tarnished humanity of her novel's inhabitants and unearths the modern complexities of rural existence. Characters and reader alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory here, into the unsettled ground of science, faith, and everyday truces between reason and conviction.
Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen. Now, after a decade of domestic disharmony on a failing farm, she has settled for permanent disappointment but seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation with a younger man. As she hikes up a mountain road behind her house to a secret tryst, she encounters a shocking sight: a silent, forested valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand it as a cautionary miracle, but it sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists, religious leaders, and the media. The bewildering emergency draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists, opportunists, sightseers, and a striking biologist with his own stake in the outcome. As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle, Dellarobia confronts her family, her church, her town, and a larger world, in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed.

I quite like the re-telling from the perspective of female characters, & don't really understand the criticism on that basis; I guess the Arthurian pantheon is too sacrosanct for a re-imagining to appeal to everyone. My last comment is addressed to the reviewers who complain of an anti-Christian bias in the book and use Pagan-bashing to make their point: I think you're both unknowingly validating MZB's premise AND hypocritically engaging in the hateful speech you are decrying.

It is rather fast paced for the most part, which to me, is pretty typical for a DS novel. I have to say, so much of this is rather unrealistic, the fact that so many major things keep happening, no one person in real life could possibly have all these kinds of things going on in their life.

656,Skeleton Crew,Stephen King,1985,1993,"Librarian's note: There is an Alternate Cover Edition for this edition of this book .
In the introduction to Skeleton Crew(1985), his second collection of stories, King pokes fun at his penchant for ""literary elephantiasis,"" makes scatological jokes about his muse, confesses how much money he makes (gross and net), and tells a story about getting arrested one time when he was ""suffused with the sort of towering, righteous rage that only drunk undergraduates can feel."" He winds up with an invitation to a scary voyage: ""Grab onto my arm now. Hold tight. We are going into a number of dark places, but I think I know the way.""And he sure does. Skeleton Crewcontains a superb short novel (""The Mist"") that alone is worth the price of admission, plus two forgettable poems and 20 short stories on such themes as an evil toy monkey, a human-eating water slick, a machine that avenges murder, and unnatural creatures that inhabit the thick woods near Castle Rock, Maine. The short tales range from simply enjoyable to surprisingly good. 
In addition to ""The Mist,"" the real standout is ""The Reach,"" a beautifully subtle story about a great-grandmother who was born on a small island off the coast of Maine and has lived there her whole life. She has never been across ""the Reach,"" the body of water between island and mainland. This is the story that King fans give to their friends who don't read horror in order to show them how literate, how charming a storyteller he can be. Don't miss it. --Fiona Webster

 I just recently re-read this selection of stories. I think my favorite is and will always be ""Word Processor of the Gods"". How many times have we wished for this ourselves? And The Mist hits all too close to home. I live in the South, but I just happen to live near a large lake that is often covered in a thick, rolling morning mist - and nearby is a nuclear power plant. It just fit almost too cozily into the setting King created. 
 All in all, this is a wonderful collection. My first brush wish his writing didn't contain as much horror as his full novels (The Body is in no way as horrifying as The Dead Zone, for example). My second brush had more horror (hello murderous oil slick - think I will rethink my swim to the local raft in the lake). However, there were charming tales as well almost like a campfire tale with the surprising, scary ending or a folk story of sprites and mischievous antics.",0.0,0,53568,371761.92,6.94,668,5,4,5

661,First Sight,Danielle Steel,2013,2013,"NEW YORK TIMESBESTSELLER
Paris, L.A., and the world of ready to wear fashion provide rich backdrops for Danielle Steel's deeply involving story of a gifted designer whose talent and drive have brought her everything--except the ability to erase her past and trust relationships.
FIRST SIGHT 
New York. London. Milan. Paris. Fashion Week in all four cities. A month of endless interviews, parties, and unflagging work and attention to detail at the semiannual ready to wear fashion shows--the famous pret-a-porter. At the center of the storm and avalanche of work is American Timmie O'Neill, whose renowned line, Timmie O, is the embodiment of casual chic, in fashion and for the home. She has created a business that inspires, fills, and consumes her life.
With an unerring instinct for what the next trend will be, an innate genius for business, tireless labor, and sheer fearlessness, starting from nothing, over two decades Timmie has built an international empire that has brought her enormous satisfaction and success. In a world where humility and compassion are all too rare, her humor, kindness, integrity, and creativity are inspirational. Yet as blessed as she feels by her success, Timmie harbors the private wounds of a devastating childhood and past tragedy. She is too smart, too experienced, and too hurt to want much in her personal life beyond a succession of convenient, very limited relationships. Always willing to take risks in business, she never risks her heart.
But despite her well-ordered and highly controlled world, it turns out that Timmie O'Neill is not immune to magic when it strikes. And it strikes in Paris during Paris Fashion Week, when an intriguing Frenchman comes into her life when she gets sick. At first, Timmie and Jean-Charles Vernier are only patient and physician. They become confidants and friends, corresponding at a safe distance between Paris and Los Angeles once she goes home. There is every reason why they must remain apart. But neither can deny their growing friendship and the electricity that sparks whenever they meet.
First Sightis as complex and compelling as modern life itself. Careers, families, histories, losses, duty, obligation, and fear of losing control and getting hurt. It is a tale of daring to take risks, and losing control just enough to have a life, when the opportunity presents itself. When two very different worlds and strong-willed people collide, everything changes in an instant, as they confront the age-old question of whether to lay oneself bare and risk intimacy--or not. Are they brave enough to face what comes next? And will they do it together or apart?",Fiction,Intermediate,5,4,14,9.8,11,3.49,2974,3.0,"First of all Danielle STeel is an auto-buy for me.

Among them is Major Ernest Pettigrew (retired), the unlikely hero of Helen Simonson's wondrous debut. Wry, courtly, opinionated, and completely endearing, Major Pettigrew is one of the most indelible characters in contemporary fiction, and from the very first page of this remarkable novel he will steal your heart.
The Major leads a quiet life valuing the proper things that Englishmen have lived by for generations: honor, duty, decorum, and a properly brewed cup of tea. But then his brother's death sparks an unexpected friendship with Mrs. Jasmina Ali, the Pakistani shopkeeper from the village. Drawn together by their shared love of literature and the loss of their respective spouses, the Major and Mrs. Ali soon find their friendship blossoming into something more.

663,The Boleyn Inheritance,Philippa Gregory,2006,2006,"The author of The Other Boleyn Girl (2002) returns to the executed queen's doomed family in a historical novel that maps the sad demise of Henry VIII in a series of intimate personal testimonies.
Gregory's tale of greed and revenge takes place against the short, unhappy tenures of Henry's fourth and fifth wives. Jockeying for position close to the throne, three powerful, ambitious women collide. The author skillfully allows each character to tell her side of the story in her own words. The first voice we hear belongs to 30-year-old Jane Boleyn, widowed sister-in-law to Anne. Jane's husband George was implicated in his sister's alleged infidelities and went with her to the scaffold in 1533; his calculating wife moved to save her inheritance rather than her husband and six years later is still scheming. Next up is Anne of Cleves, soon to be Queen Number Four, a provincial, German-speaking Protestant princess chosen by Henry's advisor, Thomas Cromwell, as a politically suitable alliance to keep Spain and France at bay. Badgered and bullied all her life by her brother and mother, 24-year-old Anne wants nothing more than to escape Cleves and have a meaningful life. The third voice belongs to Katherine Howard, a pretty, 15-year-old cousin of the dead Anne Boleyn and an incorrigible flirt who is brought to court as a lady-in-waiting by her conniving, powerful uncle, the Duke of Norfolk. Also summoned to court to attend the new queen, Jane begins plotting behind the scenes with Norfolk to assure Anne of Cleve's hasty fall and Katherine's quick ascent in Henry's favor. Gregory's knowledge of the period, combined with her novelistic skill, allows her to view this grim tale through the eyes of the three women: wily, experienced Jane; na(tm)ve, sensible Anne; and vain, greedy young Kitty.

I personaggi sono ben caratterizzati, ma quello che piu mi ha colpita e il filo conduttore che unisce tutti i tasselli della storia: nulla e lasciato al caso, ogni piccolo dettaglio contribuisce a costruire un puzzle che fino alla fine sa sorprendere e coinvolgere il lettore. Piu che i personaggi qui conta il disegno generale: non una semplice lotta tra bene e male, tra follia e ragione, tra razionalita e assurdo, ma una trama complessa in cui gli opposti si fondono fino a diventare un tutt'uno. A spiegare questa storia e soprattutto la voce di David, un ragazzino particolare che fin dalle prime battute emerge tra gli altri personaggi.

In the introduction to Skeleton Crew(1985), his second collection of stories, King pokes fun at his penchant for ""literary elephantiasis,"" makes scatological jokes about his muse, confesses how much money he makes (gross and net), and tells a story about getting arrested one time when he was ""suffused with the sort of towering, righteous rage that only drunk undergraduates can feel."" He winds up with an invitation to a scary voyage: ""Grab onto my arm now. Hold tight. We are going into a number of dark places, but I think I know the way.""And he sure does. Skeleton Crewcontains a superb short novel (""The Mist"") that alone is worth the price of admission, plus two forgettable poems and 20 short stories on such themes as an evil toy monkey, a human-eating water slick, a machine that avenges murder, and unnatural creatures that inhabit the thick woods near Castle Rock, Maine. The short tales range from simply enjoyable to surprisingly good. 
In addition to ""The Mist,"" the real standout is ""The Reach,"" a beautifully subtle story about a great-grandmother who was born on a small island off the coast of Maine and has lived there her whole life. She has never been across ""the Reach,"" the body of water between island and mainland. This is the story that King fans give to their friends who don't read horror in order to show them how literate, how charming a storyteller he can be. Don't miss it. --Fiona Webster

667,Paradise Lost,J. A. Jance,2001,2003,"John Milton's Paradise Lost is one of the greatest epic poems in the English language. It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.
Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.

From her outpost in an isolated mountain cabin, Deanna Wolfe, a reclusive wildlife biologist, watches a den of coyotes that have recently migrated into the region. She is caught off-guard by a young hunter who invades her most private spaces and confounds her self-assured, solitary life. On a farm several miles down the mountain, Lusa Maluf Landowski, a bookish city girl turned farmer's wife, finds herself unexpectedly marooned in a strange place where she must declare or lose her attachment to the land that has become her own. And a few more miles down the road, a pair of elderly feuding neighbors tend their respective farms and wrangle about God, pesticides, and the possibilities of a future neither of them expected.
Over the course of one humid summer, these characters find their connections to one another and to the flora and fauna with whom they share a place.

First, the unthinkable: a security breach at a secret U.S. government facility unleashes the monstrous product of a chilling military experiment. Then, the unspeakable: a night of chaos and carnage gives way to sunrise on a nation, and ultimately a world, forever altered. All that remains for the stunned survivors is the long fight ahead and a future ruled by fear--of darkness, of death, of a fate far worse.
As civilization swiftly crumbles into a primal landscape of predators and prey, two people flee in search of sanctuary. FBI agent Brad Wolgast is a good man haunted by what he's done in the line of duty. Six-year-old orphan Amy Harper Bellafonte is a refugee from the doomed scientific project that has triggered apocalypse. He is determined to protect her from the horror set loose by her captors. But for Amy, escaping the bloody fallout is only the beginning of a much longer odyssey--spanning miles and decades--towards the time and place where she must finish what should never have begun.
With The Passage, award-winning author Justin Cronin has written both a relentlessly suspenseful adventure and an epic chronicle of human endurance in the face of unprecedented catastrophe and unimaginable danger.

He divides his wealth into four equal parts for his wife, his two daughters, himself and leaves Minnesota for Duma Key, a stunningly beautiful, eerily remote stretch of the Florida coast where he has rented a house. All of the land on Duma Key, and the few houses, are owned by Elizabeth Eastlake, an octogenarian whose tragic and mysterious past unfolds perilously. When Edgar begins to paint, his formidable talent seems to come from someplace outside him, and the paintings, many of them, have a power that cannot be controlled.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,1,15,7.222222222222222,6,3.93,75344,3.0,"I bought this book near the summer of my third year in high school, but didn't get around to reading it because it was very thick and it felt really heavy, even in paperback.

 I ended up loving it, and was immediately sorry I had ignored it for a month. I loved the pacing and how King builds up the story, the characters, the tension, and the setting slowly, enough for me to not get exhausted on the way. A lot of people apparently had problems with the ""slow"" pacing (long-time King readers like I have noticed his narrative are becoming less jumpy and more relaxed as King grows older). But the story actually benefits from it. 
 Admittedly, it takes some time before the action really starts rolling, but by the time it does, by the time the monsters are set loose, the reader is ready and quite knowledgeable. One doesn't end up asking ""wait, how is that possible?"" or ""who is this guy again?"" or ""why do we care?"" anywhere in the action parts. Which sets this apart from many of today's thrillers that put too much focus on the ""thrill"" parts that we just end up plain not caring.

When I realised that the main character was in his 70s I originally thought it would be really cool and interesting to have a main character who wasn't young or young-ish. Instead the book was a chore. Halfway through nothing seemingly important had happened, and it wasn't until I had read about two-thirds of it that things started to get underway, and what King had done then was allowing the supernatural powers the main character had recieved to regress his age. Suddenly he was 20 years younger in body and spirit, and if that's the case it doesn't matter if he's really 70, because he isn't really anymore. Things started to get underway after two-thirds but it was still slow going. Not much action, and even when there was King described it in a way that took all the excitement out of it. Something action-y and exciting happening right now? Let me make this character sentimental for something that happened 40-60 years ago and describe it in detail, because this is what he's thinking during the split second this thing happens. Completely took all the excitement out of it. Maybe it's realistic, I don't know, but it wasn't entertaining to read. Extra credit for the plot twist in the end that I didn't see coming.

 I enjoyed the historical significance of this book. I got to see the vast riches of one side of New York City and the deprivation of the poor immigrants yearning for a new life in America on the other. 
 The story line is fairly unique where a mistress and her servant swap places, both yearning for adventure, both yearning for love, but can they find it in the deceptive web they continue to spin? 
 While I did enjoy the story and though it a pretty good story, I just wasn't able to really delve into the story. It was slow moving and didn't have a lot of ""edge"" to it. I thought there could have been stronger tension and better character development so I could truly enter their ""world"".

681,Empire Falls,Richard Russo,2001,2002,"Richard Russo--from his first novel, Mohawk, to his most recent, Straight Man--has demonstrated a peerless affinity for the human tragicomedy, and with this stunning new novel he extends even further his claims on the small-town, blue-collar heart of the country.
Dexter County, Maine, and specifically the town of Empire Falls, has seen better days, and for decades, in fact, only a succession from bad to worse. One by one, its logging and textile enterprises have gone belly-up, and the once vast holdings of the Whiting clan (presided over by the last scion's widow) now mostly amount to decrepit real estate. The working classes, meanwhile, continue to eke out whatever meager promise isn't already boarded up.
Miles Roby gazes over this ruined kingdom from the Empire Grill, an opportunity of his youth that has become the albatross of his daily and future life. Called back from college and set to work by family obligations--his mother ailing, his father a loose cannon--Miles never left home again. Even so, his own obligations are manifold: a pending divorce; a troubled younger brother; and, not least, a peculiar partnership in the failing grill with none other than Mrs. Whiting. All of these, though, are offset by his daughter, Tick, whom he guides gently and proudly through the tribulations of adolescence.
A decent man encircled by history and dreams, by echoing churches and abandoned mills, by the comforts and feuds provided by lifelong friends and neighbors, Miles is also a patient, knowing guide to the rich, hardscrabble nature of Empire Falls: fathers and sons and daughters, living and dead, rich and poor alike. Shot through with the mysteries of generations and the shattering visitations of the nation at large, it is a social novel of panoramic ambition, yet at the same time achingly personal. In the end, Empire Falls reveals our worst and best instincts, both our most appalling nightmares and our simplest hopes, with all the vision, grace and humanity of truly epic storytelling.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,14,14,14.0,12,3.91,91773,5.0,"I adore Richard Russo.

682,The Forgotten Man,Robert Crais,2005,2009,"Reprint of William Graham Sumner's popular essay ""The Forgotten Man."" ""He works, he votes, generally he prays--but he always PAYS.

 Sumner articulates what Hazlitt would some 60ish years later call the ""one lesson"" of economics, that is, the impact of a policy on not just the special interest of its intention, but rather ALL actors in a given system. While Hazlitt's concerns are economic, and many of Sumner's conclusions have economic application, Sumner's scope is broader, and indeed, concerns societal function as a whole. 
 It's amazing that an essay published in 1883 still speaks powerfully to the debates present in societal discourse today - even as Sumner's ideas have been pushed far from the mainstream by modern liberals. 
 If you are as captivated as I was, you will want to know this essay was part of a larger publication entitled ""What the Social Classes Owe Each Other,"" that is also available online. I hope to review that, too. Even if the entire publication is too meaty for you to stomach, I highly recommend ""The Forgotten Man"" segment and have included a link to the article as well as the brilliant opening and closing paragraphs below, both to remind myself and inspire you to follow! 
 ""The type and formula of most schemes of philanthropy or humanitarianism is this: A and B put their heads together to decide what C shall be made to do for D. The radical vice of all these schemes, from a sociological point of view, is that C is not allowed a voice in the matter, and his position, character, and interests, as well as the ultimate effects on society through C's interests, are entirely overlooked. I call C the Forgotten Man.... 
 ...The fallacy of all prohibitory, sumptuary, and moral legislation is the same. A and B determine to be teetotalers, which is often a wise determination, and sometimes a necessary one. If A and B are moved by considerations which seem to them good, that is enough. But A and B put their heads together to get a law passed which shall force C to be a teetotaler for the sake of D, who is in danger of drinking too much. There is no pressure on A and B. They are having their own way, and they like it. There is rarely any pressure on D. He does not like it, and evades it. The pressure all comes on C. 
 The question then arises, Who is C? He is the man who wants alcoholic liquors for any honest purpose whatsoever, who would use his liberty without abusing it, who would occasion no public question, and trouble nobody at all. He is the Forgotten Man again, and as soon as he is drawn from his obscurity we see that he is just what each one of us ought to be.""

 A difficult book to review without spoilers, but I'm going to try. 
 I enjoyed this book. The central mystery in this book [where was Jenna's mom and what happened on the night she disappeared] kept my interest until the very end. Each character's backstory was fascinating. And the intimate insight (highly researched) into the emotional lives of elephants was (for me) an unexpected and delightful bonus. I seriously learned while reading this entertaining story. 
 What I didn't love was Jenna. Her POV/thoughts didn't match her age. She was 13 years old and was even identified as an ""old soul,"" but she was way, way too wise and objective and savvy. There was some great snark, but at times it felt way too bold for her personality. 
 Also, the major twist near the end of the story strained credulity too much for me in a story where I was already aware of how much I had to suspend disbelief to stay in the narrative (as opposed to analyzing it). 
 That said, I still enjoyed this book and do recommend it. Forget Jenna's age and be prepared to buy into the unbelievable and you'll be good to go.",0.0,0,4779,4731.21,0.99,495,3,4,4
685,Survivors,James Wesley Rawles,2011,2011,"The America we are accustomed to is no more. Practically overnight the stock market has plummeted, hyperinflation has crippled commerce, and the fragile chains of supply and high-technology infrastructure have fallen. The power grids are down. Brutal rioting and looting grip every major city. The volatile era known as ""the Crunch"" has begun, and this new period in our history will leave no one untouched. In this unfamiliar environment, only a handful of individuals are equipped to survive.
Andrew Laine, a resourceful young U.S. Army officer stationed overseas in Afghanistan, wants nothing more than to return home to Bloomfield, New Mexico. With the world in turmoil and all air and sea traffic to America suspended, Laine must rely on his own ingenuity and the help of good Samaritans to reach his family. Andrew will do whatever it takes to make it home to his fiancee, no matter how difficult the circumstances.
Major Ian Doyle is a U.S. Air Force pilot sta-tioned in Arizona with his wife, Blanca. Their young daughter, Linda, is trapped in the North- eastern riots. Three teenage orphans, Shadrach, Reuben, and Matthew Phelps, have no choice but to set out on their own when their orphanage closes at the beginning of the Crunch. Then there is Ignacio Garcia, the ruthless leader of the criminal gang called La Fuerza, who will stop at nothing to amass an army capable of razing the countryside. And over everything looms the threat of a provisional government, determined to take over America and destroy the freedoms upon which it was built.
The world of Survivors is a terrifyingly familiar one. Rawles has written a novel so close to the truth, readers will forget it's fiction. If everything you thought you knew suddenly fell apart, would you survive?
""Rawles is an amazingly gifted author who has singlehandedly reignited the post-apocalyptic thriller. SURVIVORS is an instant classic."" - Brad Thor",Fiction,Intermediate,2,3,11,7.0,14,3.5,23,2.0,"My main gripe with this novel, as it was with the Rawles' companion novel Patriots, is that he writes every character in his own voice. It was not as noticeable in the previous novel because the characters in that book were hardened survivalists, and had trained themselves and prepared for the End of the World, much like Rawles himself-- so the similarity in lingo and emphasis on the minutae of which type of gun each character carries with which attatchments and how many magazines of which capacity and type of ammo in each one (pant, pant) is expected. 
 Survivors deals with the same subject, in the same world and the same time, but with a mixture of characters that, going in, one would expect would deal with the crisis in different ways. There is the requisite trained and prepared Survivalist family, consisting of two ex-military brothers of hardy Finnish descent, Lars and Anders Laine. They and their families are written in a very similar way to the group in the first novel, and since the purpose of the book is to ""entertain and educate"", they get something of a pass. 
 The problem is that the rest of the cast-- all of them-- also all speak with Rawles' voice. It gets really preachy. 
 I had hoped that the family from Kentucky, who are the least-prepared folks in the book, managed to survive based on their wits as opposed to their years of collecting ammo and guns.

687,Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,Susanna Clarke,2004,2004,"Two magicians shall appear in England. The first shall fear me; the second shall long to behold me.
Centuries ago, when magic still existed in England, the greatest magician of them all was the Raven King. A human child brought up by fairies, the Raven King blended fairy wisdom and human reason to create English magic.
Now, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, he is barely more than a legend, and England, with its mad King and its dashing poets, no longer believes in practical magic. Then the reclusive Mr Norrell of Hurtfew Abbey appears and causes the statues of York Cathedral to speak and move.
News spreads of the return of magic to England and, persuaded that he must help the government in the war against Napoleon, Mr Norrell goes to London. There he meets a brilliant young magician and takes him as a pupil. Jonathan Strange is charming, rich and arrogant. Together, they dazzle the country with their feats.
But the partnership soon turns to rivalry. Mr Norrell has never conquered his lifelong habits of secrecy, while Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous magic.He becomes fascinated by the shadowy figure of the Raven King, and his heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens, not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear.
Elegant, witty and utterly compelling, Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrellcreates a past world of great mystery and beauty that will hold the reader in thrall until the last page.",Fiction,Intermediate,11,3,14,9.272727272727272,1,3.8,162,4.0,"Being a consider'd Review of Miss Susanna Clarke's novel, entitled Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, containing remarks that might prove injurious to the enjoyment of those who have not yet perused it. 
 We should perhaps from the outset affirm our admiration and approval of Miss Clarke's work, as being a remarkable and original addition to the bookshelves of those whose literary tastes run to the Magickal and Fantastick. However, we shall perhaps have cause to cavil at some points therein, and possibly some critickal remarks to make, for alas! fine though this book is, it is a human artefact, and thus necessarily flawed. 
 Let us, then, deal with the aspects of the work that we found less than satisfactory first, that we may dispense with the distasteful business as quickly as possible. Our first remark in this vein would be to note that Miss Clarke has not been well served by the gimcrack advertising with which it was heralded. The hucksters who hailed the book as being the finest thing in creation this side of Miss Austen's latest have perhaps raised unreasonable expectations in the breasts of prospective readers, expectations which, it need not be said, cannot be met by the material actually on offer, as opposed to that adumbrated in the advance publicity, which existed only in the imagination of the publicists. Comparison to Miss Rowling's novels (apparently on the ground that both authors are female, and both make mention of magick) was especially meretricious; there are no further points of similarity between them whatever. Advertising is a tawdry business at best, and it seems that now-a-days it is necessary to bray loud and long to attract attention, instead of allowing the work to stand on its own merits. At least Mr. Neil Gaiman, whose remarks in praise of the work were trumpeted loudest by the same publicists, should have known better than to join in the exaggerated braying, altho' he has it seems had the grace to protest that his words were distorted in meaning since. It is of no great moment, to be sure, in the long run, and equally surely none of Miss Clarke's doing, but we would urge prospective readers to put entirely from their minds any thought of the extravagant praise with which the book has been hailed in some quarters, and judge it instead for what it is, and solely on its own virtues. (And, by the same token, let no heed be taken of those among the Literary Criticks, who having divined that Miss Clarke's tome is like to prove popular, pour scorn upon it for no other reason than that it is popular. Such is always their cry, even when they have never taken the trouble to read the book in question). 
 Secondly, we fear Miss Clarke has not been well served by her editors. To put it shortly; the book is too long. On reading it, we became a trifle weary about three quarters of the way in, and laid it aside for other amusements. Upon returning to our perusal a little later, we soon found that the action picked up somewhat, and further reading, to the conclusion, prov'd to need not the slightest effort. We should judge that the book would be the better for being about a quarter to a third shorter than it is; it is not clear to us, for example, that quite so much detail was necessary when describing Mr. Strange's adventures in the Peninsular War, amusing tho' some of those episodes are. We have seen before how success has allowed certain writers to free themselves from the clutches (as they see it) of editors, and write ever longer and more prolix works (we are thinking particularly of Miss Rowling in saying this). If Miss Clarke is to begin at this length, we confess to a slight shudder at the thought of what she might do if success were to free her from strict edition. 
 Thirdly, and most grievously, we must point out that Miss Clarke has something of a problem in Logick, or perhaps a problem in Magick, for at whiles she makes the latter too easy. At one point Mr. Strange transports the entire city of Brussels, and all its inhabitants, to the Americas, apparently to avoid Bonaparte's army, but it seems to us mainly to furnish Miss Clarke with an occasion for humour. This feat at once raises two objections; first, why not simply transport Bonaparte and his army to the Antarctic, and thus avoid the whole battle of Waterloo, and, second, if Mr. Strange can execute magick of that magnitude, why is he wasting his time on trifles, when he could be performing much greater deeds, and even, if he so chose, setting himself up in great splendour and riches? It is always annoying in any work of the fantastick when the writer breaks their own internal logick merely for their own immediate purpose; it jars, and cause the suspension of disbelief to hit the floor with a rude bump. 
 Having thus lighted upon the book's chief faults, what might we say of its virtues? We might say that they are many; the execution of such basic devices as plot, atmosphere and characterisation is entirely satisfactory. Humour, too, is present in a large degree, although readers looking for pratfalls, slapstick and vulgar jokes are best advised to seek elsewhere: Miss Clarke deals in more subtle currency, using such delicate means as irony (the favoured vehicle of her avowed heroine Miss Jane Austen) and a certain sly wit to convey the humour in a situation to the reader. 
 Best of all, perhaps, is the subtle and extremely satisfying evocation of her Other England; ostensibly the England we know, and peopled by many famous persons - of whom we might name the present Duke of Wellington, His Majesty the late King George the Third, and the late and almost wholly unlamented Lord Byron as being foremost in the story, and very prettily painted they are, too - but yet withal an England with a very different history, an at times alarmingly different present, and, possibly, a very different future. This is done largely through the creation - we might say the magnificent creation - of the figure of John Uskglass, the Raven King. Uskglass makes but the briefest appearance in the main body of the story, but he is a brooding and growing presence throughout the book. Without ever being clearly limned, Uskglass is at once a fascinating, attractive and troubling figure; it is not clear whether he is a force for Good or Evil, or merely for himself, and it is also unclear whether he will return to England, and if he should, what the consequences might be. (Much of Uskglass' history is outlined in extensive footnotes, which also act as the repository for a good deal of the sly humour earlier alluded to). 
 The power and the danger of the magick awoken by Messrs. Strange & Norrell is made very real (which makes such lapses as the Brussels incident even more grating), and so too is the otherness and essential alienity of Faerie, as exemplified by the un-named gentleman with thistledown hair; the gentleman is a genuinely frightening figure, without any resort to vulgar Gothick devices, and the terrible fates of Lady Pole, Mrs. Strange and Stephen Black (to my mind the true hero of the book) haunt the reader quite as much as more showy horror might. No melodrama here, for which we may be thankful, but an abiding sense of terror and horror is evoked nonetheless. Strange's madness is not quite so well portrayed; too much of this part of the book relies on the hackneyed device of people never telling one another what they actually mean, which is all very well in some trashy farce but grates a little in a work of such obvious learning and wit as this is. 
 (Perhaps there is some excuse for the length of the work; Miss Clarke relies on building her Other England not by outright exposition, but by the slow accretion of layers of information and allusion, all of which allows the notion of the Raven King and all the other fantastical appurtenances of her world to grow naturally in the reader's mind. It may be that a shorter book would not admit of this powerful effect, or at least not shew it to its best advantage). 
 Of the characters we will say that we felt Mr. Norrell (the less sympathetic of the two protagonists) to be the more completely drawn, which vitiates against a proper sympathy for Mr. Strange somewhat, but not to very great disadvantage. Of the lesser characters, many are finely drawn - John Childermass especially -, but a few suffer from having more information vouchsafed to us concerning them than is warranted by their position and importance in the story; we think here especially of Jeremy Johns. All, however, come to life on the page very well, and none seemed less than credible. 
 Of plot, we can remark that it is well crafted and most satisfactory, with several cunning twists we did not perceive beforehand, and reaching a conclusion, which, while wholly in keeping with what had gone before, and not unpleasing, is by no means final, and leaves the way forward to continue the story in later volumes. 
 Of language, we note that some have made complaint of the use Miss Clarke makes of the literary forms usual in the years of which she writes. We make no such complaint - as the astute among you will have realised by our own use of a poor imitation of the same manner - it is entirely appropriate, and most enjoyable, and adds greatly to that effect of 'otherness' (which the Russian criticks have called ostranenie, 'making strange') we have so highly praised above. 
 We shall conclude with some remarks on Miss Clarke's obvious learning; she wears it lightly, and is by no means inclined to show off, but it is abundantly clear that she has done much research; we had no fault to find with her evocation of the real England upon which hers is based. Indeed we are sure that there were many allusions to matters we are ignorant of, and look forward to these being pointed out to us by the better read in some work of exegesis such as is popular with the admirers of Mr. Pratchett or Professor Tolkien. 
 We crave your patience for having written at such length about this work, but we can recommend it unreservedly, despite the small failings to which we have earlier alluded; we make no doubt that we shall read very few books this year that rival it in skill or in the enjoyment afforded to the reader, and look forward eagerly to the sequellae promised us by Miss Clarke in the coming years.

690,The Broker,John Grisham,2005,2006,"In his final hours in the Oval Office, the outgoing President grants a controversial last-minute pardon to Joel Backman, a notorious Washington power broker who has spent the last six years hidden away in a federal prison. What no one knows is that the President issues the pardon only after receiving enormous pressure from the CIA. It seems Backman, in his power broker heyday, may have obtained secrets that compromise the world's most sophisticated satellite surveillance system.
Backman is quietly smuggled out of the country in a military cargo plane, given a new name, a new identity, and a new home in Italy. Eventually, after he has settled into his new life, the CIA will leak his whereabouts to the Israelis, the Russians, the Chinese, and the Saudis. Then the CIA will do what it does best: sit back and watch. The question is not whether Backman will survive, there is no chance of that. The question the CIA needs answered is, who will kill him?

Maybe it's because I'm reading a book about romance novels for one of my classes (and thus in the mood for a good romance novel), but I just didn't feel very fulfilled by this book. Don't get me wrong, I loved the story & found it very suspenseful, but part of what makes Grisham's writing so supsenseful is that he's so sparse in his character descriptions, leaving evidence for their motivations to the minimum. Maybe I'm just too ""female"" but I like getting a little more emotionally involved in the lives of the characters I'm reading about. 
 For those of you who have no idea what the story's about: A lame duck President is convinced by the veteran CIA director to grant a pardon to the man involved in THE political scandal of his day. The man they release, ""The Broker,"" has been unwilling to share his secrets with the government, so they release him & help him hide away in Italy while simultaneously leaking his whereabouts to the right people in the hopes that knowing who assassinates The Broker will unravel some of the mystery surrounding the sensitive information that sent him to jail in the first place.

Their three children--teenage aspiring model Samantha, pre-med student Scott, and entertainment lawyer Allegra--are successful and happy. Allegra, as an attorney to the stars, has a career that consumes so much of her energy that she has little time for a private life--until a chance encounter with a New York writer turns her life upside down. Suddenly, she finds herself planning a wedding at her parents' Bel Air home.
As preparations begin, the chaos of last-minute arrangements, surprise announcements and ever-increasing anxiety brings out both the best and the worst in everyone. But while couples in each generation of the Steinberg family struggle with broken vows and new hopes, the real meaning of Allegra's wedding emerges. It is a bridge between the past and the future, an opportunity for reconciliation, forgiveness and new hope for the future--as weddings often are for us all.",Fiction,Intermediate,7,6,15,7.714285714285714,8,3.73,5133,4.0,"This is a typical Danielle Steel novel. I hate to say it, but she does have a sort of ""formula"", or ""style"", for her books, for the most part. I do, however, enjoy reading her books occasionally, in spite of this. The Wedding revolves around Allegra Steinberg, and her Hollywood family. It is really a whirlwind of a book, one major event after another just keeps on happening to Allegra, her family, or one of her clients (Allegra is an entertaiment attorney). It is rather fast paced for the most part, which to me, is pretty typical for a DS novel. I have to say, so much of this is rather unrealistic, the fact that so many major things keep happening, no one person in real life could possibly have all these kinds of things going on in their life. To me, this book has a soap opera feel to it, but I enjoy soap operas, so for me, this was a fairly good read, hence the four star rating (I'm actually giving it 3.75 stars, but you can't indicate that here).

Addie Baum is The Boston Girl, born in 1900 to immigrant parents who were unprepared for and suspicious of America and its effect on their three daughters.

Eighty-five-year-old Addie tells the story of her life to her twenty-two-year-old granddaughter, who has asked her ""How did you get to be the woman you are today?""

From the one-room tenement apartment she shared with her parents and two sisters, to the library group for girls she joins at a neighborhood settlement house, to her first, disastrous love affair, Addie recalls her adventures with compassion for the naive girl she was and a wicked sense of humor.

The fact is that Tony Webster, a middle-aged man, never gave much thought to his past at all until his closest childhood friends return with a vengeance -- one of them from the grave and another maddeningly present. Tony thought he'd left all this uncertainly behind as he built a life for himself. Tony has created a very ordinary life for himself that includes the usual trappings of marriage, family, and career. But his marriage has become an amicable divorce, and his career has turned into a comfortable retirement. Presented with a mysterious legacy that obliges him to reconsider a variety of things he thought he'd understood all along, Tony may have to revise his estimation of his own nature and his place in the world. The Sense of an Ending is so compelling that it begs to be read in",Fiction,Intermediate,5,8,16,12.4,4,3.7,18,4.0,"Interesting concept on how our memories of our lives are often skewed. This story can really have someone think about how our rash reactions can have long lasting effects on others. 
 One of my favorite quotes from the book is, ""History is that certainty produced at the point where the imperfections of memory meet the inadequacies of documentation."" Another was ""Someone once said that his favourite times in history were when things were collapsing, because that meant something new was being born."" ""Sometimes I think the purpose of life is to reconcile us to its eventual loss by wearing us down, by proving, however long it takes, that life isn't all it's cracked up to be."" Of course, I don't agree with this last statement because I firmly believe that although life may not be perfect, it's what we make of it.",1.0,0,310,306.9,0.99,314,1,1,3
