But 'here' turns out to be a cavernous and ornate old theater where they are utterly isolated from the outside world - and where heat and power and, most importantly, food are in increasingly short supply.

I'm writing my review more about the spirit of the book. Haunted is probably the most cynical book I've ever read. Hey, I'm cynical myself. I think fame and celebrity are bullshit too. I think there are plenty of people that are pain addicted, self-indulgent assholes too. I write in your face, shock horror too. But Palahniuk's book made me want to go OD on heroin in a piss-soaked alley. 
 Look, the guys clearly a genius. Every page is spiked with incredibly imaginative and well-researched scenarios and the structure of the whole thing is novel: A master story threading a series of shorts together like a necklace of rotting heads. Personally, I liked the shorts better than the master story. A lot more. 
 I know horror ain't supposed to uplift, but there wasn't one damned character that didn't drip with some sort of pollution and horrible narcissism. Not a drollop of hope for the human race in the whole thing. Palahniuk's characters are lost souls in a lost world. If he weren't such a great writer I would have abandoned this book, but he is, so I finished it and have the depression to prove it. 
 4 stars for incredible writing and originality. 1 star knocked off for mental duress.

704,The Exorcist,William Peter Blatty,1971,1994,"Four decades after it first shook the nation, then the world, William Peter Blatty's thrilling masterwork of faith and demonic possession returns in an even more powerful form. Raw and profane, shocking and blood-chilling, it remains a modern parable of good and evil and perhaps the most terrifying novel ever written.",Fiction,Intermediate,55,1,10,3.5636363636363635,16,4.14,128301,5.0,"Because I basically now only read books for research material for my writing projects, and doing reviews on them would be BORING... I decided to post some thoughts on books that influenced my life. When I say ""influenced"" it could be profound... or even a book that I enjoyed so much that I it became a marker for a particular type of genre of entertainment that I have since enjoyed all my life. 
 I'd like to share a few thoughts on the book ""The Exorcist."" 
 The novel is a big influence on me, both professionally and personally. The book was a huge sensation when it was first published and then a few years later it was made into a famous motion picture that changed Hollywood forever. Most people have only seen the film and not read the novel. That may not be as true with people who are my age because at the time of its initial release, it was the book to read. 
 The novel was written around 1969 by William Peter Blatty and published in 1971. And though the author has claimed otherwise, the book was immediately a hit. Excuse me while I run through the plot in a few brief sentences. If you don't know the story of this book via the famous film, then your biggest worry is more along the lines of someone discovering where you've landed your flying saucer. 
 A Washington D.C. teenager, Regan MacNeil, becomes possessed by a demon and her mother eventually turns to a young priest, Father Karris, to perform an exorcism. The young priest is not experienced in such matters so he brings in an older priest, Father Merrin, to perform the rites of expulsion. The confrontation between good and evil climaxes with the demon being excised from Regan but at a cost to the living. 
 According to Wikipedia - ""It was inspired by a 1949 case of demonic possession and exorcism that Blatty heard about while he was a student in the class of 1950 at Georgetown University, a Jesuit school."" 
 Neither I nor my friends knew any of the above when we got a hold of the novel in paperback. By this time the year was 1973. I was 13 years old, going to junior high school, and the book for a few weeks was a major distraction in our lives. I distinctly remember the day I first read the illicit passages from the novel. The paperback was being passed around class while the teacher was obliviously giving his lesson on... whatever. When the book finally was handed to me, it looked like some sacred holy book -- dog eared, marked up, and otherwise showing all the signs of having been through the sweaty fingers of hundreds of the devoted. 
 ""Just read the underlined parts."" That was the mantra being said as it was slipped underneath chairs or buried in the middle of a text book as it made its way around the room from student to student. 
 The ""underlined parts"" were like nothing I had ever read before... heard anyone talk about before... even imagined before! It had a young girl saying filthy things, doing awful things... and some of those nasty things were sexual... and religious... combined! I mean a cross jammed into her private parts while saying obscene things about Jesus Christ!!!!! 
 I think I got about only half way through the underlined parts before the guy sitting behind me tapped my shoulder and urged me to hand over the book. I wasn't a slow reader; it was just that there were stuff that I couldn't help reading dozens of times! I handed the book over, but a few days later I secretly obtained my own copy of the novel. 
 I read ""The Exorcist"" from cover to cover in a day and then read it again. This was the beginning of a long affair with the book. And it had nothing to do with the salacious stuff. Okay, well maybe a little... but the nasty bits isn't why I have read the book nearly a half dozen times since. 
 The fascination with the writing is because of Blatty's ambitious attempt to grabble with the concepts of good vs. evil within the context of a commercial thriller. Indeed, his thoughtful philosophical probing would just a few years later seem ridiculously quaint and redundant when other imitators in the genre jettisoned that aspect of the novel in their own attempts to follow up the commercial success of Blatty's book. When Blatty wrote the book he was a successful Hollywood screenwriter who would take off time from working on scripts for serious writing - novels. For him, the deeper exploration of religious and philosophical concepts probably was the reason for devoting time to writing the book in the first place. It was almost as if that he decided to throw in a riveting thriller plot so he didn't have to share his dark ruminations by himself. 
 Blatty's depiction of Regan's ""possession"" is complicated, ambiguous, and far more nuanced than the screenplay (which Blatty also wrote, winning an academy award) for the famous movie. But that's what books can do that other mediums often fall short of. The amazing thing about looking back at the book from a modern vantage point is to see how much ""doubt"" Blatty raises about the ""demonic possession"" even though the mental health field then wasn't even in the same ballpark with today's modern practices. The fact that Blatty spends more than a fair amount of time exploring the medical possibilities to explain Regan's bizarre behavior seems almost prophetic. 
 Also in the book, using Father Karris as his surrogate, Blatty plays around with a lot of questions... musings... doubts concerning the problems facing humanity. Years before he took on writing the novel, the author studied to be a Jesuit priest and there's little doubt that the failure or problems associated with Blatty not answering the order's call ended up informing the development of the Father Karris character. In fact, the most shocking aspect of the novel is how a plot that is ostensibly about good vs. evil has so much lack of faith on the side of good. It is just one of several miraculously time resistant reasons that this book is still such a great read! 
 Years later, after my initial reading of the book, in 1989 to be exact, I had and encounter with William Friedkin, the director of the movie ""the Exorcist."" Friedkin, was in the middle of directing another supernatural movie hoping to resurrect a career that had a few peaks, but too many valleys since his celebrated blockbuster film from 1973. 
 The movie was titled ""The Guardian"" and I was there because I was just starting out my career as a writer, working for ""Fangoria"" magazine. Often times this is the only way a punk like me gets a chance to spend some time with a director of such great accomplishments - my career escalator was going up from the bottom floor... and Friedkin's career escalator was stuck between floors. 
 Asking Friedkin questions about ""The Exorcist"" was a natural part of the interview. His latest production was clearly an attempt to get back to that early high water mark. Unfortunately, none of his answers concerning his masterpiece yielded any insight, except an unintentional one -- I learned that often times artists don't age as well as their creations. 
 We discussed his relationship with Blatty... the book... the movie they worked on together and why a sequel of ""the Exorcist"" had neither involved, reportedly because of disagreements they endured over the years involving the one project that made them both famous. 
 ""Blatty and I argued a lot,"" Friedlin said to me that day. ""I wish it wasn't the case. The sequel was an abomination. The simple explanation is we didn't always see eye to eye. And neither of us wanted to look the other way."" 
 They would end up having more disagreements over the years, but neither would see the success of their collaboration exceeded, or even approached. Which probably also reveals something insightful about the fragility and complexity of achieving artistic greatness. 
 I was supposed to have a follow-up interview with Friedkin the next day but it was cancelled. I was told later by a member of the crew that the director of ""the Exorcist, ""the French Connection,"" (but also ""Jade"" and ""Blue Chips"") had a disagreement with someone on the set, pulled down his pants and stormed off the soundstage. His comeback film would bomb both commercially and critically a few months later. 
 William Peter Blatty never pulled his pants down in public, but he did over the years make every effort to reveal his soul in his later work. And though he never achieved anything remotely as deep or groundbreaking as his 1971 novel, there were flashes of brilliance in ""The Ninth Configuration"" and ""Dimiter."" 
 The last influence Blatty's work had on me personally came in the literary sequel to ""the Exorcist"" entitled ""Legion."" The book unfortunately was not a return to the artistic quality of his masterpiece. The film based on his novel, which Blatty himself directed, captures some shocking moments and has a few interesting set pieces. But alas, missing from both the book and the movie was any real attempt to further the discussion about the bigger questions of good vs. evil... except at the very end of the novel. 
 The coda of ""Legion"" I found to be very profound. And it was something that stayed with me for years and years. Truth be told, it ended up being the first piece of the puzzle when I began conceiving of the plot for ""Demon Days - Angel of Light."" Reaffirming that it's possible that a writer working at the top of his game can possess you for decades and never let go of your soul.",1.0,0,468,1399.3200000000002,2.99,219,2,5,5

Here, in his newest work, Sparks tells a story about making the greatest commitment of all...loving someone forever.
The Rescue
When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks - risks no one else in the department would ever take - to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate.
Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone.
During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love.
In The Rescue Nicholas Sparks weaves his inimitable spell, immersing us in the passions and the surprising complexities of modern relationships-and in doing so, teaching us something about our own.",Fiction,Intermediate,14,1,14,8.071428571428571,12,4.1,143722,2.0,"I really didn't like Taylor.

711,Loving Frank,Nancy Horan,2007,2007,"I have been standing on the side of life, watching it float by. I want to swim in the river. I want to feel the current.
So writes Mamah Borthwick Cheney in her diary as she struggles to justify her clandestine love affair with Frank Lloyd Wright. Four years earlier, in 1903, Mamah and her husband, Edwin, had commissioned the renowned architect to design a new home for them. During the construction of the house, a powerful attraction developed between Mamah and Frank, and in time the lovers, each married with children, embarked on a course that would shock Chicago society and forever change their lives.
In this groundbreaking historical novel, fact and fiction blend together brilliantly. While scholars have largely relegated Mamah to a footnote in the life of America's greatest architect, author Nancy Horan gives full weight to their dramatic love story and illuminates Mamah's profound influence on Wright.
Drawing on years of research, Horan weaves little-known facts into a compelling narrative, vividly portraying the conflicts and struggles of a woman forced to choose between the roles of mother, wife, lover, and intellectual. Horan's Mamah is a woman seeking to find her own place, her own creative calling in the world, and her unforgettable journey, marked by choices that reshape her notions of love and responsibility, leads inexorably to this novel's stunning conclusion.",Fiction,Intermediate,5,5,15,11.0,6,3.74,126,5.0,"This was a great book. I had read ""The Women"" by T.C. Boyle, so I didn't jump upon this book even though it came highly recommended. Since I read the Boyle book, I knew the ending, but this book focused more on Mamah, the 2nd ""woman"" in Frank Lloyd Wright's life. 
 When I read this historical novel, I was immersed in the women's right movement and the time in which women were almost completely dependent on men. One of the largest conflicts (which still rages today) is whether woman can put her self love above the love of her children. Especially for a man like FLW. I enjoyed reading the other reviews because many reviewers found FLW not worth the sacrifice. However, one can't help but think that Mamah loved him and was inspired by his greatness. She was also troubled by FLW's shortcomings but they paled in comparison with living with her faithful, uninspiring husband, Edmund. 
 I couldn't help but notice the reviewers who thought Mamah was heartless to leave her children. I struggled with Mamah's decision throughout the book. I was surprised by her resolve to remain in another country from her children in order to achieve her independence. I couldn't help but applaud her because she was one of the many women who decided to take a different path and be courageous no matter the cost. The troubling part is that she indirectly hurt other women in the process. 
 I really enjoyed the book because of its historical fiction and the way Horan portrays a strong and sensitive woman along with the historical elements of FLW's early career.",0.0,0,35640,249123.6,6.99,804,5,2,5

This chance encounter and its startling consequences propel Katey on a yearlong journey from a Wall Street secretarial pool toward the upper echelons of New York society and the executive suites of Conde Nast--rarefied environs where she will have little to rely upon other than a bracing wit and her own brand of cool nerve.

716,Firefly Lane,Kristin Hannah,2008,2013,"In the turbulent summer of 1974, Kate Mularkey has accepted her place at the bottom of the eighth-grade social food chain. Then, to her amazement, the ""coolest girl in the world"" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become TullyandKate. Inseparable.
So begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.
From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness.
Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend. . . .
For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,13,13,13.0,3,4.04,73,5.0,"Best friends forever (BFF), Kate and Tully are there for each other since one specific night back in 1974. This story of this relationship lasts over three decades, and their friendship exists despite time and distance, through thick and thin, despite boyfriends and husbands. Yet, one event severs the friendship nearly forever. 
 Kate is the introvert, preferring to read; Tully is the extrovert, trying to prove to herself that she is lovable, and they meet somewhere in the middle, knowing each other's secrets, hurts, and fears. With the idea that they share a passion for the same thing, they choose a similar career path...at least at first, but the heart wants what it wants and secretly they eventually want different things and choose a different path in life. 
 This is also a story of mothers and daughters: Tully's mother, Katie's mother, and Marah Rose, Katie's daughter. Profound, redemptive, and heartbreaking this story gets to the heart of what it means to love unconditionally, or not. To love people at their best and worst and still accept them for themselves. 
 Be forewarned: it is a tearjerker, yet there are more moments of laughter and joy. 
 For anyone with a friendship that lasts through the years (this reader kept being reminded of the continuing friendship of my own sister Connie and her friend Teri), this may be a story to enjoy.

 He withdraws information and feeds it piecemeal, always leaving the reader (and the characters in the story) wanting for more. His pacing is also exquisite in that there was no slow parts except maybe for one part (Jack Stephano's interrogation). The plot was, in other words, masterfully crafted, peppered with surprises and satisfying moments as the bad guys have no choice but to accept the demands of Patrick the scheming bastard. 
 Kudos to Grisham for this gift.

721,Loving Frank,Nancy Horan,2007,2007,"I have been standing on the side of life, watching it float by. I want to swim in the river. I want to feel the current.
So writes Mamah Borthwick Cheney in her diary as she struggles to justify her clandestine love affair with Frank Lloyd Wright. Four years earlier, in 1903, Mamah and her husband, Edwin, had commissioned the renowned architect to design a new home for them. During the construction of the house, a powerful attraction developed between Mamah and Frank, and in time the lovers, each married with children, embarked on a course that would shock Chicago society and forever change their lives.
In this groundbreaking historical novel, fact and fiction blend together brilliantly. While scholars have largely relegated Mamah to a footnote in the life of America's greatest architect, author Nancy Horan gives full weight to their dramatic love story and illuminates Mamah's profound influence on Wright.
Drawing on years of research, Horan weaves little-known facts into a compelling narrative, vividly portraying the conflicts and struggles of a woman forced to choose between the roles of mother, wife, lover, and intellectual. Horan's Mamah is a woman seeking to find her own place, her own creative calling in the world, and her unforgettable journey, marked by choices that reshape her notions of love and responsibility, leads inexorably to this novel's stunning conclusion.",Fiction,Intermediate,5,5,15,11.0,6,3.74,126,5.0,"This was a great book. I had read ""The Women"" by T.C. Boyle, so I didn't jump upon this book even though it came highly recommended. Since I read the Boyle book, I knew the ending, but this book focused more on Mamah, the 2nd ""woman"" in Frank Lloyd Wright's life. 
 When I read this historical novel, I was immersed in the women's right movement and the time in which women were almost completely dependent on men. One of the largest conflicts (which still rages today) is whether woman can put her self love above the love of her children. Especially for a man like FLW. I enjoyed reading the other reviews because many reviewers found FLW not worth the sacrifice. However, one can't help but think that Mamah loved him and was inspired by his greatness. She was also troubled by FLW's shortcomings but they paled in comparison with living with her faithful, uninspiring husband, Edmund. 
 I couldn't help but notice the reviewers who thought Mamah was heartless to leave her children. I struggled with Mamah's decision throughout the book. I was surprised by her resolve to remain in another country from her children in order to achieve her independence. I couldn't help but applaud her because she was one of the many women who decided to take a different path and be courageous no matter the cost. The troubling part is that she indirectly hurt other women in the process. 
 I really enjoyed the book because of its historical fiction and the way Horan portrays a strong and sensitive woman along with the historical elements of FLW's early career.",0.0,0,35640,249123.6,6.99,804,5,1,5

 After stealing ninety million dollars from his law firm Patrick Lanigan has been running for four years. He has been traveling around the world hiding from those who wish to hunt him down and get their money back. In Brazil they finally track him down. Now he is being hauled back to the States to face the trial of a lifetime. His lawyer is trying to come up with a defence, but he gets the feeling that he is not being presented with all the facts. Meanwhile Patrick's lover and partner in crime, is working to set him free. Only one thing can possibly keep him from jail...the truth. 
 John Grisham has done a great job with this one. The Partner keeps you guessing all the way through, you never know all of the facts until the very last page. The reader finds out the facts as Lanigan's lawyer finds them out, each and every detail is a shocker. You cannot possibly guess all of the twists involved in this novel. The characters in this novel are well-done, although I would have liked a little bit more depth. The plot was very intriguing and it was interesting to see how Lanigan could twist the system to work for his needs. I loved the introduction as it set the stage for everything in your mind. It grabbed your attention and made you want to know more, so you read on and you don't want to stop. There is so much information and so many details to watch for that you need to pay attention while reading it. As much as I loved this book, I had one major complaint, the ending! The end of the book was disappointing, all that build up for that! I am still glad I read it though. 
 I recommend The Partner to Grisham fans and those who enjoy lawyer dramas.

725,The Birth Of Venus,Sarah Dunant,2004,2003,"Sarah Dunant's gorgeous and mesmerizing novel, Birth of Venus, draws readers into a turbulent 15th-century Florence, a time when the lavish city, steeped in years of Medici family luxury, is suddenly besieged by plague, threat of invasion, and the righteous wrath of a fundamentalist monk. Dunant masterfully blends fact and fiction, seamlessly interweaving Florentine history with the coming-of-age story of a spirited 14-year-old girl. As Florence struggles in Savonarola's grip, a serial killer stalks the streets, the French invaders creep closer, and young Alessandra Cecchi must surrender her ""childish"" dreams and navigate her way into womanhood. Readers are quickly seduced by the simplicity of her unconventional passions that are more artistic than domestic: 
Dancing is one of the many things I should be good at that I am not. Unlike my sister. Plautilla can move across the floor like water and sing a stave of music like a song bird, while I, who can translate both Latin and Greek faster than she or my brothers can read it, have club feet on the dance floor and a voice like a crow. Though I swear if I were to paint the scale I could do it in a flash: shining gold leaf for the top notes falling through ochres and reds into hot purple and deepest blue.Alessandra's story, though central, is only one part of this multi-faceted and complex historical novel. Dunant paints a fascinating array of women onto her dark canvas, each representing the various fates of early Renaissance women: Alessandra's lovely (if simple) sister Plautilla is interested only in marrying rich and presiding over a household; the brave Erila, Alessandra's North African servant (and willing accomplice) has such a frank understanding of the limitations of her sex that she often escapes them; and Signora Cecchi, Alessandra's beautiful but weary mother tries to encourage yet temper the passions of her wayward daughter. A luminous and lush novel, The Birth of Venus, at its heart, is a mysterious and sensual story with razor-sharp teeth. Like Alessandra, Dunant has a painter's eye--her writing is rich and evocative, luxuriating in colors and textures of the city, the people, and the art of 15th-century Florence. Reminiscent of Tracy Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring, but with sensual splashes of color and the occasional thrill of fear, Dunant's novel is both exciting and enchanting.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,9,15,11.666666666666666,6,3.79,132,4.0,"I'm tweaking the version of the book I read - I actually listened to the audio which is probably what kept this book from getting 5 stars.

She was too chirpy, not necessarily in a happy, upbeat way but chirpy like an annoying bird outside your window at dawn. Very irritating, and it was a shame because Dunant is magnificent. Fortunately the reader didn't ruin the book for me, but if I had read instead of listened it would have been a much more satisfying experience. Other than that, I loved the book, and I wish Dunant would write about her Italian Renaissance at least once a year. And I want my own beautiful copies of her books in my collection, hers are the books you want to savor, reread especially beautiful passages, and think about long after they're finished.",0.0,0,45576,136272.24000000002,2.99,730,5,2,4

Now, in her highly anticipated new book, she has delivered her most affecting novel yet--and one unlike anything she's written before.
For more than a decade, Jenna Metcalf has never stopped thinking about her mother, Alice, who mysteriously disappeared in the wake of a tragic accident. Refusing to believe that she would be abandoned as a young child, Jenna searches for her mother regularly online and pores over the pages of Alice's old journals. A scientist who studied grief among elephants, Alice wrote mostly of her research among the animals she loved, yet Jenna hopes the entries will provide a clue to her mother's whereabouts.
Desperate to find the truth, Jenna enlists two unlikely allies in her quest. The first is Serenity Jones, a psychic who rose to fame finding missing persons--only to later doubt her gifts. The second is Virgil Stanhope, a jaded private detective who originally investigated Alice's case along with the strange, possibly linked death of one of her colleagues. As the three work together to uncover what happened to Alice, they realize that in asking hard questions, they'll have to face even harder answers.
As Jenna's memories dovetail with the events in her mother's journals, the story races to a mesmerizing finish.

I more or less agree with it) and liked it. Though I did feel that the ending of that book was a little abrupt but overall the content was very strong and moving. That is why when I received a request to review this book I grabbed the opportunity. 
 The blurb will remind you of the Scarlett Keeling case (you can google to know more about her). I had assumed that the book would be a rehash of that incident but I was taken by surprise when the protagonists mentions the case in the beginning and takes it as a reference point for the Liza Kay case. In fact the book becomes quite real when the protagonist Simran talks about the Delhi rape case and how it has affected her thinking. Of how she relates the disappearance of Liza with the insecurity she feels for her own daughter. 
 The book is Simran's journey of finding the truth about Liza and of getting justice for her. The book has its own flaws, there are loopholes in the investigation or the way the book wraps up but at the end of the day it is a good book to read because it shows you a murky reality. It shows us a side of Goa which is hard to believe but surely exists. It shows us a side of today's youth which is again hard to accept but sadly exists. 
 It is a good read which makes you cringe, think and contemplate. It reminds you of the horrific Delhi rape case and of the crime rampant against women. It reminds you that in this society if you are wearing a skirt you are asking for being raped!! And by smoking/ drinking etc you are actually handing over a open invitation to be raped. Mind you after all this; the truth is ""you had asked for it"". The book is very contemporary even in the terms of depicting how corruption is deeply rooted in our society & how easy it is for people with power to escape punishment for their deadliest deeds.

It is an act that drags his adult children, his black maid, and Jake into a conflict as riveting and dramatic as the murder trial that made Brigance one of Ford County's most notorious citizens, just three years earlier.
The second will raises far more questions than it answers. Why would Hubbard leave nearly all of his fortune to his maid? Had chemotherapy and painkillers affected his ability to think clearly? And what does it all have to do with a piece of land once known as Sycamore Row?",Fiction,Intermediate,22,1,13,4.590909090909091,8,3.98,57537,5.0,"There is no way that John Grisham could have forgotten one of his most historic and well loved characters. He gives a small write up about how and when he decided to bring Jake back. I do not care what his reasons were, I'm just glad he did. He's not only back, but Jake stays true to character. A small town good guy who stands up for what is right. 
 Carla, Hanna, Lucien and others are back and are the backbone to the strength that Jake can show. Without them and their support, I am not sure he would be the tall, strong character I envision while I read the book. Judge Atlee is very busy in Sycamore Row and plays an intrical part in how it unfolds. 
 This time the court case is about a will and whether the writer had the testamentary capacity to produce it. Normally a will is not an exciting event, but with Grisham's touch, it can sure be made one. Seth Hubbard turns his back on almost his entire family for someone he's only known three years. Jake is made responsible for seeing that Seth's wishes are carried out and he takes that responsibility seriously.

731,Everything Is Illuminated,Jonathan Safran Foer,2002,2002,"The simplest thing would be to describe Everything is Illuminated, Jonathan Safran Foer's accomplished debut, as a novel about the Holocaust. It is, but that really fails to do justice to the sheer ambition of this book. The main story is a grimly familiar one. A young Jewish-American--who just happens to be called Jonathan Safran Foer--travels to the Ukraine in the hope of finding the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. He is aided in his search by Alex Perchov, a naive Ukrainian translator, Alex's grandfather (also called Alex) and a flatulent mongrel bitch, named Sammy Davis JR JR. On their journey through Eastern Europe's obliterated landscape they unearth facts about the Nazi atrocities and the extent of Ukrainian complicity that have implications for Perchov as well as Safran Foer. This narrative is not, however, recounted from (the character) Jonathan Safran Foer's perspective. It is relayed through a series of letters that Alex sends to Foer. These are written in the kind of broken Russo-English normally reserved for Bond villains and Latka from the US television series Taxi. (Sentences such as ""It is mammoth honour for me write for a writer, especially when he is American writer, like Ernest Hemingway""; ""It is bad and popular habit for people in Ukraine to take things without asking"" are the norm.) Interspersed between these letters are fragments of a novel by ""Safran Foer""--a wonderfully imagined, almost magical realist, account of life in the Shetl before the Nazis destroyed it. These are in turn commented on by Alex creating an additional metafictional angle to the tale. If all this sounds a little daunting don't be put off; Safran Foer is an extremely funny as well as intelligent writer. Admittedly he has an annoying habit of capitalising great chunks of text, but minor typographical nuances are easy to ignore in a book that combines some of the best Jewish folk yarns since Isaac Bashevis Singer with a quite heartbreaking meditation on love, friendship and loss. --Travis Elborough",Fiction,Intermediate,1,15,15,15.0,11,3.9,855,2.0,some rather amusing moments - but overall I didn't appreciate it.,1.0,0,1646,1629.54,0.99,58,2,1,2

Sisters. Strangers. Survivors.
More than twenty years ago, Claire and Lydia's teenaged sister Julia vanished without a trace. The two women have not spoken since, and now their lives could not be more different. Claire is the glamorous trophy wife of an Atlanta millionaire. Lydia, a single mother, dates an ex-con and struggles to make ends meet. But neither has recovered from the horror and heartbreak of their shared loss--a devastating wound that's cruelly ripped open when Claire's husband is killed.
The disappearance of a teenage girl and the murder of a middle-aged man, almost a quarter-century apart: what could connect them? Forming a wary truce, the surviving sisters look to the past to find the truth, unearthing the secrets that destroyed their family all those years ago . . . and uncovering the possibility of redemption, and revenge, where they least expect it.

734,Ulysses,James Joyce,1934,1986,"In the past, Ulysses has been labeled dirty, blasphemous, and even unreadable. None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains the modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, Ulysses is also a compulsively readable book.
William Blake saw the universe in a grain of sand. Joyce saw it in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904, a day distinguished by its utter normality. Two characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, go about their separate business, crossing paths with a gallery of indelible Dubliners. We watch them teach, eat, stroll the streets, argue, and (in Bloom's case) masturbate. And thanks to the book's stream-of-consciousness technique--which suggests no mere stream but an impossibly deep, swift-running river--we're privy to their thoughts, emotions, and memories. The result? Almost every variety of human experience is crammed into the accordian folds of a single day, which makes Ulysses not just an experimental work but the very last word in realism.
Considered the greatest 20th century novel written in English, in this edition Walter Gabler uncovers previously unseen text.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,2,6,4.555555555555555,6,3.74,1500,5.0,"It took ten weeks, but I made it, more or less unscathed, through Ulysses. What hasn't been said about this book? I don't feel any need to try to be original here; I guess as far as recommending this, you'll either adore it or you'll despise it. The Circe, Nausicaa, and Penelope chapters alone are worth the price/toil of admission. Getting through some chapters, admittedly, proved to be a Herculean task (I won't name names so as not to predispose you on that front), and Joyce's voice/style/narrative technique (whatever you wish to call it, and it seems a bit reductive to say his 'technique' when each section mutates and becomes something entirely other) is, as they say, quite difficult. If you can make it through the first four chapters, you'll have no trouble getting through Ulysses in its entirety, which isn't to say they're the 'hardest' but that by that point, you've either become accustomed to it (and feel that you've already put enough effort in that you need to finish) or you've decided it's the literary equivalent of a barrel of bricks, which it will begin to feel like when you lug it and the Annotated Guide around in your backpack everyday for upwards of two months. 
 Leopold and Molly Bloom are two of the most distinctive figures in literature--something I'd always heard but somehow assumed couldn't be true because of the way people talk of them. Stephen I'm iffy on; I want to find him alluring, but most I was just ambivalent to or irritated by him. The bit characters pop in and out, are fully-fleshed or never explained, and are often just as fascinating. I'm particularly taken with Mrs. Breen, for some reason. But you'll certainly remember them by the end of it all. 
 As I said, I don't wish to be pretentious here. I read it for a class, which is likely the only thing that would have forced me to trudge through it--and I'm very glad I was coerced. It's not just one of the most glamorous notches on a lit scholar's belt, but a really fucking great text. Often literally belly-achingly funny; at other moments, it leaves you feeling entirely hollow and pointless. It will make you work, there's no doubt about that, but I do think the payoff justifies the effort. My professor left us with this thought on Ulysses: Joyce refigures the classical hero as a mostly ordinary man who makes it through the day with no great losses or gains, which in itself becomes epic; simply getting by is the great journey of the text. I liked this notion, though there are a million other things to pick up on, and it's something that I think will stick with me for some time to come.",1.0,0,36936,36566.64,0.99,786,5,4,5

 Meh. I borrowed Gone from the library due to it's intriuging cover and the fact that a friend had specifically not recommended it to me, saying I'd hate it. I decided to read it anyways, going in with a positive attitude and hoping to prove her wrong. Unfortunately, she knew me too well. 
 As I've mentioned several times in previous reviews, I love original and refreshing plots and characters. Gone lacked both of these. Knowing that the novel was about a student-teacher romance I expected high-stakes and angst but instead it was causal, bland, and boring. I ended up finding Connor's neighbours' and friends' lives more interesting than Connor's. His mother's alcoholism was random and didn't really affect the plot other than to isolate Connor from his family, which I guess may have led Connor to seek companionship in Corrina? One of the most poorly written aspects was the romance between Corinna and Connor. I didn't understand the initial attraction or the sexual tension. I thought it was really juvenile and unrealistic that they'd fall in love with each other in only a week and become so intimate so quickly. This was definitely not an accurate representation of how relationships, let alone studen-teacher relationships evolve. 
 I think Kathleen Jeffrie Johnson tried to tackle too many issues in such a short novel and it ended up as a jumble in the end. Alcoholism, death, teenage romance, sexuality, student-teacher relationships, drug abuse, loneliness, abuse, etc. are all very controversial and tough issuse to conquer individually let alone all in th same novel. I wish that Connor's thought process had been more clearly explained, for example if he had compared his relationship to Zach and Risa's and seen the differences for him and Corrina the reader might have understood why he wanted to move with her so badly. In novels like this it's so hard to write an ending that applies to each of these topics so in the end Kathleen focused on isolation (hence the title ""Gone"") which may have worked as a final chapter if there weren't so many other pressing issues and logistics left unfinished. 
 Despite not liking the overall novel there were a few points I did enjoy. I thought it was very creative to have the student-teacher romance not take place during the school year or on school property but rather in the summer, where the chances of being caught and the repurcussions were a bit different. I liked how Corinna was an average formally-troubled woman who happened to fall in love with a student as opposed to a sensual provocative woman lurring every male at school. The fact that she was as isolated and naive as Connor made her seem more like a fellow student than someone almost 10 years older than him.",0.0,0,670,3678.3,5.49,166,2,3,2

On October 1, God is in His heaven, the stock market stands at 10,140, most of the planes are on time, and Clayton Riddell, an artist from Maine, is almost bouncing up Boylston Street in Boston. He's just landed a comic book deal that might finally enable him to support his family by making art instead of teaching it. He's already picked up a small (but expensive!) gift for his long-suffering wife, and he knows just what he will get for his boy Johnny. Why not a little treat for himself? Clay is feeling good about the future.
That changes in a hurry. The cause of the devastation is a phenomenon that will come to be known as The Pulse, and the delivery method is a cell phone. Everyone's cell phone. Clay and the few desperate survivors who join him suddenly find themselves in the pitch-black night of civilization's darkest age, surrounded by chaos, carnage, and a human horde that has been reduced to its basest nature...and then begins to evolve.
There is really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clay, an arrow points home to Maine, and as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north they begin to see crude signs confirming their direction. A promise, perhaps. Or a threat...

It answers it with a vengeance.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,11,13,4.7,16,3.64,2582,4.0,"Stephen King finally jumped into the zombie bandwagon, and what a jump! Lots of gory description: ""intestines hanging out"", ""ears torn off leaving holes in the head"", ""festering leg wounds"", definitely not for the squeamish reader. Non-stop action as a group of survivors from The Pulse are being driven or herded into a killing ground. The only lull comes when the group members are debating what happened or planning some mayhem against the zombies. 
 It's a well known fact to the scientific community that a nuclear explosion above the atmosphere could destroy electronic devices on the ground unless these are shielded in some way - they named it electromagnetic pulse or EMP. Stephen King took literary license by limiting the damage to cell phones only and called it The Pulse with a capital ""P"". At least that's a theory of the group of survivors, although one of them thinks it could have been a virus or worm in the cell phone network. Anyway, when The Pulse happened, everybody using a cell phone were turned into mindless, violent, robot-like creatures. Clay and Tom, strangers to each other, banded together early, when they saw what was happening around them. They also saved a 15-year old girl, Alice, who was traumatized when her own mother became a zombie and attacked her so violently that she had to defend herself. Clay, estranged from his wife and devoted to their son, wanted to search for them and he cannot be dissuaded by the other two. Along the way, they meet a schoolmaster and one of his students, Jordan, who is an accomplished computer geek. They become aware that a leader (they named him Raggedy Man), has risen from the ranks of the zombies and the zombies themselves have begun to develop telepathic and levitation abilities. When the combined group destroys a ""flock"" of zombies by burning them, the Raggedy Man led the remaining zombies to kill all the disorganized normals they could find as a reprisal. Clay's group is so horrified by the savagery, that they decided to suspend any hostilities against the zombies. By now, the Raggedy Man can communicate with them telepathically and they were declared a protected group as they were herded into another city, where the group suspected they were going to be killed as a warning to everyone who opposed the zombies. Clay's group meets more people who did something similar to what they have done and they combined forces - one of them was a pregnant woman, Denise, who lost a husband to the zombies. Travelling with her and protecting her is an explosive expert, Ray. They also met bands of normals who are working with, and sometimes protecting the zombies, and they lost one of their members to this band. The climax of the story happened in a country fairground. It is here that Clay finally meets his wife, who has already become one of the zombies, but his son is still missing. Clay's group finally wins over the zombies and resumes their journey to escape. Clay separates from the remaining members in order to search for his son - and finds him, another victim of The Pulse, although a non-violent one. 
 At the end of the book, Clay believing Jordan's theory that another dose of The Pulse might cure his son, was holding a cell phone to his ear and dialling.

Yet in one twisted connivance of fate, tragedy can strike not once, not twice, but multiple times. All throughout their ordeal, I always thought that if Donna just had a mobile phone, things would've turned out differently; but of course there'd be no story. 
 As one can expect, Stephen King's prose combines multiple elements of effective story writing (whatever they are called) through the lives of his characters in his chosen town. All these conspire to weave a tale that one would want to hide away from the world just to relish it, and finish it without disturbance.",1.0,0,2600,7774.000000000001,2.99,26,3,3,5
747,Masquerade,Janet Dailey,1990,2012,"After being humiliated by her fiancee, Sophie Franklyn has decided that getting involved with work colleagues and men in general isn't for her. Now her focus is going to be on her career and her recent promotion. That is until at a New Year's Eve masquerade ball, she meets a man that tempts her to question her choices.
Alex Scavoni is extremely dedicated to his job, so dedicated that his first marriage crumbled under the pressure of his dedication. Now he's happily single, with a new job he's excited to start. When he meets a masked Sophie at the ball, she fires desires in him he thought long dead. He spends a wonderful night with her, but wakes up alone.
The next time the two meet, it's in the high pressure world of Emergency Room medicine where they must work side by side. While they deal with the stresses of the Emergency ward, they endeavor to keep their feelings for each other on a professional nature. When the desire that pushed them together that one night flares to life again, can they ignore them or will their one night together have consequences neither of them planned on?

 Ohhh Sophie and Alex! What am I going to do with you two!? Other than shout at you and make my husband and pups give me looks of, what in the world is she doing over there? ;) 
 This was a really fun read. A bit steamy but not overly so. The characters, as you see above, are equally as fun. Sophie and Alex are both enigmas and you just hope by the end that they will get their crap together instead of letting so much get in the way! They have both been bitten and although they have a fabulous night of passion, neither thinks they'll see the other, but they do and that one night of passion slowly grows into something more. 
 I love the way the plot is paced. These two do jump into bed rather quickly but they are both consenting adults so this really did add to, not take away from the story for me. Actually it was that night that the basis of the story revolves around. It's actually quite frustrating but also a little hilarious how they dance around each other. Alex drives me a little crazy but I really think they both did at different parts of the book. 
 ""I've no expectations tonight, Sophie"" 
 Sophie was saved from having to make a reply as the doors opened on her floor. She quickly stepped out and made her way to her apartment. He was always so in tune with what she was thinking. Were her feelings written all over her face? Or had their night together created a connection between them that couldn't be broken? But if that were true, why couldn't she feel or see wht Alex was thinking? Perhaps it was etter that she didn't. She had to try to sever their connection, otherwise working with him would be evern harder than she tought it would be. 
 She held the door open for him and he indicated for her to precede him into the room. She turned the lights on, but dimmed them so they created a soft glow. The full moon created a ghostly pattern on the river and was shining in through her window. 
 ""How would you like your coffee?"" she asked as she made her way into the kitchen to turn her automatic coffee machine on. ""I can give you an espresso, cappuccino, latte, or flat white."" 
 She tried to control the shivers coursing through her as he came up to stand behind her. Even after all they'd been through that evening, his aftershave wafted over her. 
 He whistled softly. ""That's an impressive machine. You must like your coffee."" 
 Do you SEE what I mean here? These two, H O T! No sex in that scene but boy did I need some water through this entire book. It's fabulous. 
 The only character I didn't like was of course Neil but he is in the plot for a reason, so we all hate him. And I so do. It was Phoebe that really made this for me though. She is just one of those gals that made me feel like I would tell all of my secrets to and never regret it.

750,Freedom,William Safire,1987,2010,"In his first novel since The Corrections, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Walter and Patty Berglund as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.

 Franzen has almost entirely adhered to the simple point-and-tell way of God informing the reader of what happens throughout the book, interspersed with a few character perspective moments. 
 Walter and Patty Berglund are a smart, suburban, modern married couple who are in turmoil and seemingly cannot come to terms with this. They avoid each other rather, avoiding their issues apart from when they fight, which is like a cold, staged play, reminiscent of Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"" in some affects. 
 Franzen's main strengths are the storytelling, the parallel plots and treating the reader like an intelligent person. At the same time, the best bits of this book read way better than a very long episode of ""Desperate Housewives"", which it often reminded me of. At its worst, the book reminded me of a very long, outstretched and bloated episode of ""Desperate Housewives"". 
 Some might say this book pin-points the human condition of relationships in modern-day western civilisation, and I'll say it does to a certain extent. Franzen is very good at writing matter-of-factly when it comes to describing human emotions which I think works to his advantage: the reader is allowed to think for herself/himself and the characters of the book come out a lot differently than if Franzen would have applied sappy adjectives throughout. 
 All in all, this is a big book, and I think its flaws and brilliance is part of what it's all about: people's inner worlds, as felt inside and projected outside.

Only later will the grieving Abe learn that his mother's fatal affliction was actually the work of a vampire.

Stephen King's most gripping and unforgettable novel, Bag of Bones,is a story of grief and a lost love's enduring bonds, of a new love haunted by the secrets of the past, of an innocent child caught in a terrible crossfire.
Set in the Maine territory King has made mythic, Bag of Bonesrecounts the plight of forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan, who is unable to stop grieving even four years after the sudden death of his wife, Jo, and who can no longer bear to face the blank screen of his word processor.
Now his nights are plagued by vivid nightmares of the house by the lake. Despite these dreams, or perhaps because of them, Mike finally returns to Sara Laughs, the Noonans' isolated summer home.
He finds his beloved Yankee town familiar on its surface, but much changed underneath--held in the grip of a powerful millionaire, Max Devore, who twists the very fabric of the community to his purpose: to take his three-year-old granddaughter away from her widowed young mother.
As Mike is drawn into their struggle as he falls in love with both of them, he is also drawn into the mystery of Sara Laughs, now the site of ghostly visitations, ever-escalating nightmares, and the sudden recovery of his writing ability. What are the forces that have been unleashed here--and what do they want of Mike Noonan?
As vivid and enthralling as King's most enduring works, Bag of Bonesresonates with what Amy Tan calls ""the witty and obsessive voice of King's powerful imagination."" It's no secret that King is our most mesmerizing storyteller. In Bag of Bones--described by Gloria Naylor as ""a love story about the dark places within us all""--he proves to be one of our most moving.",Fiction,Intermediate,20,1,16,6.05,4,3.87,79,5.0,"The beginning of the book was a bit boring.

Paris, L.A., and the world of ready to wear fashion provide rich backdrops for Danielle Steel's deeply involving story of a gifted designer whose talent and drive have brought her everything--except the ability to erase her past and trust relationships.
FIRST SIGHT 
New York. London. Milan. Paris. Fashion Week in all four cities. A month of endless interviews, parties, and unflagging work and attention to detail at the semiannual ready to wear fashion shows--the famous pret-a-porter. At the center of the storm and avalanche of work is American Timmie O'Neill, whose renowned line, Timmie O, is the embodiment of casual chic, in fashion and for the home. She has created a business that inspires, fills, and consumes her life.
With an unerring instinct for what the next trend will be, an innate genius for business, tireless labor, and sheer fearlessness, starting from nothing, over two decades Timmie has built an international empire that has brought her enormous satisfaction and success. In a world where humility and compassion are all too rare, her humor, kindness, integrity, and creativity are inspirational. Yet as blessed as she feels by her success, Timmie harbors the private wounds of a devastating childhood and past tragedy. She is too smart, too experienced, and too hurt to want much in her personal life beyond a succession of convenient, very limited relationships. Always willing to take risks in business, she never risks her heart.
But despite her well-ordered and highly controlled world, it turns out that Timmie O'Neill is not immune to magic when it strikes. And it strikes in Paris during Paris Fashion Week, when an intriguing Frenchman comes into her life when she gets sick. At first, Timmie and Jean-Charles Vernier are only patient and physician. They become confidants and friends, corresponding at a safe distance between Paris and Los Angeles once she goes home. There is every reason why they must remain apart. But neither can deny their growing friendship and the electricity that sparks whenever they meet.
First Sightis as complex and compelling as modern life itself. Careers, families, histories, losses, duty, obligation, and fear of losing control and getting hurt. It is a tale of daring to take risks, and losing control just enough to have a life, when the opportunity presents itself.

Brenna harbors no illusions that her husband is in love with her, but their shared past gives her hope. Maybe the laird who once visited her father's castle and charmed her with a dazzling, unexpected smile remains underneath Connor's stern exterior.
But as she sets out to win the man whom she has come to adore, a legacy of revenge ensnares Brenna in a furious clan war--and only her faith in her new husband can save her...

I lost myself in the divagations (this word isn't even in my Webster's New World Dictionary - outrageous!), but then strangely found myself reappearing in various passages. This is a real feat of imagination - of the horror and fears and hopes and desires and hatreds, which sounds Faulknerian, as parts of it were. There were also strong echoes of Whitman in the brotherhood of humanity calls to arms - both friendly and deadly. I barreled through the lengthy passages, resisting an impulse to dwell on the numerous tiny details and aspects of living in Harlem, since the chapters, and the novel itself, just seemed interminable. I never thought I would get to the end of it, and when I did, it felt like a drop. I didn't feel moved along by a plot, necessarily, but I felt almost as if the fluidity of the writing gripped me enough and something truly important really depended on my keeping reading. Ellison has a very commanding voice, but not in an overly aggressive way. There are some violent parts here, which how could there not be, given the subject matter of race relations, specifically between Black and White in America, and the writing entered such a different space in those parts, I found my images jostled, as a simple hodge-podge of images, a flying fist here, a sudden light there, a momentary shift in perspective, as someone who had been standing, is now prostrate. 
 We never do find out who the main character is - either the original name or the Brotherhood name, or really, that much about his backstory, even though we follow him from high school to college to work life as an organizer, public speaker, important bon vivant, man about town.

Priceless and beautiful, the book is one of the earliest Jewish volumes ever to be illuminated with images. When Hanna, a caustic loner with a passion for her work, discovers a series of tiny artifacts in its ancient binding--an insect wing fragment, wine stains, salt crystals, a white hair--she begins to unlock the book's mysteries. The reader is ushered into an exquisitely detailed and atmospheric past, tracing the book's journey from its salvation back to its creation.
In Bosnia during World War II, a Muslim risks his life to protect it from the Nazis. In the hedonistic salons of fin-de-siecle Vienna, the book becomes a pawn in the struggle against the city's rising anti-Semitism. In inquisition-era Venice, a Catholic priest saves it from burning. In Barcelona in 1492, the scribe who wrote the text sees his family destroyed by the agonies of enforced exile. And in Seville in 1480, the reason for the Haggadah's extraordinary illuminations is finally disclosed. Hanna's investigation unexpectedly plunges her into the intrigues of fine art forgers and ultra-nationalist fanatics.

Luminous, haunting, unforgettable, The Age of Miraclesis a stunning fiction debut by a superb new writer, a story about coming of age during extraordinary times, about people going on with their lives in an era of profound uncertainty.
On a seemingly ordinary Saturday in a California suburb, 11-year-old Julia and her family awake to discover, along with the rest of the world, that the rotation of the earth has suddenly begun to slow. The days and nights grow longer and longer, gravity is affected, the environment is thrown into disarray. Yet as she struggles to navigate an ever-shifting landscape, Julia is also coping with the normal disasters of everyday life--the fissures in her parents' marriage, the loss of old friends, the hopeful anguish of first love, the bizarre behavior of her grandfather who, convinced of a government conspiracy, spends his days obsessively cataloging his possessions. As Julia adjusts to the new normal, the slowing inexorably continues.

It's been a while an author had me on my toes but Ted literally took my heart from it's position and kept in my mouth! What?!!!!! 
 Been my first Dekker novel, I had high hopes. Overly high expectations. I've heard so much and truth be told, he didn't disappoint. Since I wasn't very familiar with this genre, I sort mentally prepared myself. I was ready to absorb whatever he had to offer so I made sure I paid rapt attention devoid of any distractions. 
 A psychotic thriller which was indeed thrilling with a little twist to the cliche plot. At some point, I felt like the suspense went on a downward spiral. It began to feel predictable but then before I knew it, it was rekindled with another twist. 
 As usual, fantastic story-telling, insightful narratives, great use of language with a keen attention to details. Of course, I wasn't expecting him to fall short in these aspects. He had a reputation to uphold. 
 There wasn't any form of stalling from the very beginning. The antagonist was introduced almost immediately which I'm still quite skeptical about but I think that made it an even more exciting read. The protagonist was somewhat unbelievable in between. I thought Brad Raines' physical appearance wasn't real enough and was somewhat overly exaggerated but Ted somehow made up for his inadequacies towards the end. 
 For someone like me. It was highly enlightening. It felt a lecture with the narratives and of course I was impacted with some knowledge. 
 The central theme wasn't particularly glaring even till the end. All I could decipher was the war between good and evil. How evil manipulated itself to the point of delusion. At the end, good obviously overcame. That was the simplest way I understood it. I loved the fact that there was a Christian backing to it which I wasn't even conscious of until the epilogue which shows the overall strength of the plot. 
 Some people think the story was cliche and predictable but I think it's too early for me to conclude. I was an exciting read. The suspense was top notch. Greater than anything I've ever read and I'm glad I did. Not bad for an introduction. Not bad at all.

Centuries ago, when magic still existed in England, the greatest magician of them all was the Raven King. A human child brought up by fairies, the Raven King blended fairy wisdom and human reason to create English magic.
Now, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, he is barely more than a legend, and England, with its mad King and its dashing poets, no longer believes in practical magic. Then the reclusive Mr Norrell of Hurtfew Abbey appears and causes the statues of York Cathedral to speak and move.
News spreads of the return of magic to England and, persuaded that he must help the government in the war against Napoleon, Mr Norrell goes to London. There he meets a brilliant young magician and takes him as a pupil. Jonathan Strange is charming, rich and arrogant. Together, they dazzle the country with their feats.
But the partnership soon turns to rivalry. Mr Norrell has never conquered his lifelong habits of secrecy, while Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous magic.He becomes fascinated by the shadowy figure of the Raven King, and his heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens, not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear.

 We should perhaps from the outset affirm our admiration and approval of Miss Clarke's work, as being a remarkable and original addition to the bookshelves of those whose literary tastes run to the Magickal and Fantastick. However, we shall perhaps have cause to cavil at some points therein, and possibly some critickal remarks to make, for alas! fine though this book is, it is a human artefact, and thus necessarily flawed. 
 Let us, then, deal with the aspects of the work that we found less than satisfactory first, that we may dispense with the distasteful business as quickly as possible. Our first remark in this vein would be to note that Miss Clarke has not been well served by the gimcrack advertising with which it was heralded. The hucksters who hailed the book as being the finest thing in creation this side of Miss Austen's latest have perhaps raised unreasonable expectations in the breasts of prospective readers, expectations which, it need not be said, cannot be met by the material actually on offer, as opposed to that adumbrated in the advance publicity, which existed only in the imagination of the publicists. Comparison to Miss Rowling's novels (apparently on the ground that both authors are female, and both make mention of magick) was especially meretricious; there are no further points of similarity between them whatever. Advertising is a tawdry business at best, and it seems that now-a-days it is necessary to bray loud and long to attract attention, instead of allowing the work to stand on its own merits. At least Mr. Neil Gaiman, whose remarks in praise of the work were trumpeted loudest by the same publicists, should have known better than to join in the exaggerated braying, altho' he has it seems had the grace to protest that his words were distorted in meaning since. It is of no great moment, to be sure, in the long run, and equally surely none of Miss Clarke's doing, but we would urge prospective readers to put entirely from their minds any thought of the extravagant praise with which the book has been hailed in some quarters, and judge it instead for what it is, and solely on its own virtues. (And, by the same token, let no heed be taken of those among the Literary Criticks, who having divined that Miss Clarke's tome is like to prove popular, pour scorn upon it for no other reason than that it is popular. Such is always their cry, even when they have never taken the trouble to read the book in question). 
 Secondly, we fear Miss Clarke has not been well served by her editors. To put it shortly; the book is too long. On reading it, we became a trifle weary about three quarters of the way in, and laid it aside for other amusements. Upon returning to our perusal a little later, we soon found that the action picked up somewhat, and further reading, to the conclusion, prov'd to need not the slightest effort. We should judge that the book would be the better for being about a quarter to a third shorter than it is; it is not clear to us, for example, that quite so much detail was necessary when describing Mr. Strange's adventures in the Peninsular War, amusing tho' some of those episodes are. We have seen before how success has allowed certain writers to free themselves from the clutches (as they see it) of editors, and write ever longer and more prolix works (we are thinking particularly of Miss Rowling in saying this). If Miss Clarke is to begin at this length, we confess to a slight shudder at the thought of what she might do if success were to free her from strict edition. 
 Thirdly, and most grievously, we must point out that Miss Clarke has something of a problem in Logick, or perhaps a problem in Magick, for at whiles she makes the latter too easy. At one point Mr. Strange transports the entire city of Brussels, and all its inhabitants, to the Americas, apparently to avoid Bonaparte's army, but it seems to us mainly to furnish Miss Clarke with an occasion for humour. This feat at once raises two objections; first, why not simply transport Bonaparte and his army to the Antarctic, and thus avoid the whole battle of Waterloo, and, second, if Mr. Strange can execute magick of that magnitude, why is he wasting his time on trifles, when he could be performing much greater deeds, and even, if he so chose, setting himself up in great splendour and riches? It is always annoying in any work of the fantastick when the writer breaks their own internal logick merely for their own immediate purpose; it jars, and cause the suspension of disbelief to hit the floor with a rude bump. 
 Having thus lighted upon the book's chief faults, what might we say of its virtues? We might say that they are many; the execution of such basic devices as plot, atmosphere and characterisation is entirely satisfactory. Humour, too, is present in a large degree, although readers looking for pratfalls, slapstick and vulgar jokes are best advised to seek elsewhere: Miss Clarke deals in more subtle currency, using such delicate means as irony (the favoured vehicle of her avowed heroine Miss Jane Austen) and a certain sly wit to convey the humour in a situation to the reader. 
 Best of all, perhaps, is the subtle and extremely satisfying evocation of her Other England; ostensibly the England we know, and peopled by many famous persons - of whom we might name the present Duke of Wellington, His Majesty the late King George the Third, and the late and almost wholly unlamented Lord Byron as being foremost in the story, and very prettily painted they are, too - but yet withal an England with a very different history, an at times alarmingly different present, and, possibly, a very different future. This is done largely through the creation - we might say the magnificent creation - of the figure of John Uskglass, the Raven King. Uskglass makes but the briefest appearance in the main body of the story, but he is a brooding and growing presence throughout the book. Without ever being clearly limned, Uskglass is at once a fascinating, attractive and troubling figure; it is not clear whether he is a force for Good or Evil, or merely for himself, and it is also unclear whether he will return to England, and if he should, what the consequences might be. (Much of Uskglass' history is outlined in extensive footnotes, which also act as the repository for a good deal of the sly humour earlier alluded to). 
 The power and the danger of the magick awoken by Messrs. Strange & Norrell is made very real (which makes such lapses as the Brussels incident even more grating), and so too is the otherness and essential alienity of Faerie, as exemplified by the un-named gentleman with thistledown hair; the gentleman is a genuinely frightening figure, without any resort to vulgar Gothick devices, and the terrible fates of Lady Pole, Mrs. Strange and Stephen Black (to my mind the true hero of the book) haunt the reader quite as much as more showy horror might. No melodrama here, for which we may be thankful, but an abiding sense of terror and horror is evoked nonetheless. Strange's madness is not quite so well portrayed; too much of this part of the book relies on the hackneyed device of people never telling one another what they actually mean, which is all very well in some trashy farce but grates a little in a work of such obvious learning and wit as this is. 
 (Perhaps there is some excuse for the length of the work; Miss Clarke relies on building her Other England not by outright exposition, but by the slow accretion of layers of information and allusion, all of which allows the notion of the Raven King and all the other fantastical appurtenances of her world to grow naturally in the reader's mind. It may be that a shorter book would not admit of this powerful effect, or at least not shew it to its best advantage). 
 Of the characters we will say that we felt Mr. Norrell (the less sympathetic of the two protagonists) to be the more completely drawn, which vitiates against a proper sympathy for Mr. Strange somewhat, but not to very great disadvantage. Of the lesser characters, many are finely drawn - John Childermass especially -, but a few suffer from having more information vouchsafed to us concerning them than is warranted by their position and importance in the story; we think here especially of Jeremy Johns. All, however, come to life on the page very well, and none seemed less than credible. 
 Of plot, we can remark that it is well crafted and most satisfactory, with several cunning twists we did not perceive beforehand, and reaching a conclusion, which, while wholly in keeping with what had gone before, and not unpleasing, is by no means final, and leaves the way forward to continue the story in later volumes. 
 Of language, we note that some have made complaint of the use Miss Clarke makes of the literary forms usual in the years of which she writes. We make no such complaint - as the astute among you will have realised by our own use of a poor imitation of the same manner - it is entirely appropriate, and most enjoyable, and adds greatly to that effect of 'otherness' (which the Russian criticks have called ostranenie, 'making strange') we have so highly praised above. 
 We shall conclude with some remarks on Miss Clarke's obvious learning; she wears it lightly, and is by no means inclined to show off, but it is abundantly clear that she has done much research; we had no fault to find with her evocation of the real England upon which hers is based. Indeed we are sure that there were many allusions to matters we are ignorant of, and look forward to these being pointed out to us by the better read in some work of exegesis such as is popular with the admirers of Mr. Pratchett or Professor Tolkien. 
 We crave your patience for having written at such length about this work, but we can recommend it unreservedly, despite the small failings to which we have earlier alluded; we make no doubt that we shall read very few books this year that rival it in skill or in the enjoyment afforded to the reader, and look forward eagerly to the sequellae promised us by Miss Clarke in the coming years.

Sam Cayhall is a former Klansman and unrepentant racist now facing the death penalty for a fatal bombing in 1967. He has run out of chances -- except for one: the young, liberal Chicago lawyer who just happens to be his grandson.
While the executioners prepare the gas chamber, while the protesters gather and the TV cameras wait, Adam has only days, hours, minutes to save his client. For between the two men is a chasm of shame, family lies, and secrets -- including the one secret that could save Sam Cayhall's life... or cost Adam his.

And we are the prey.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,5,15,5.9375,14,3.72,133370,4.0,"This is my first Michael Crichton read, and I loved it. Prey is told in first person by Jack Foreman, a stay-at-home dad, who suspects his wife, Julia, of having an affair. Julia, a vice president at Xymos, a molecular manufacturing company, works late night, and one night she doesn't even come home at all. Eventually, Julia shows Jack a video demonstration of what they're working on - a cloud of nanoparticles, which works as one big camera. Then something goes wrong at the facility and Jack is invited by Ricky, his former employee to come and help fix the problem. A cloud of nanoparticles -- micro-robots -- has escaped from the laboratory, and he has to get it back. But this cloud is self-reproducing, intelligent; it evolves quickly, and is now a threat. There at the facility Jack learns the truth about his wife, the nanoparticles, and his former co-workers. 
 The book has a slow start. Jacks suspects his wife of having an affair and he's taking time on deciding what to do because he isn't very sure yet. He doesn't want a divorce; he wants to keep his family together, and his kids, always biting each other, are not helping matters. He can't get a job; he's rejected wherever he applies because of a 'got fired for doing the right thing' incident in his former workplace. 
 And then the story kicks off when he's asked to come and solve a problem at the plant. Then comes the action, the suspense, and of course the thrill. You wouldn't want to be anywhere near the swarms - those molecular robots. They're dangerous, they hurt the skin, and they can get into your nasal cavity, suffocating you. They kill wildlife as well as humans. Jack has to stop it, no matter what. Because he designed the program used in modeling the swarms. But he can't do it himself. There are other notable characters there like the quiet, strong and beautiful Mae; devious Ricky; loud-farting/non-stop talking Charley; and of course Jack's beautiful and secretive wife, Julia. Some of these characters help to achieve the goal, while others stand in Jack's way. There are lots of deaths in the end. 
 I loved the technological and biological details the author wove in the various part of the story. It's blended well into the narrative and doesn't cause any distraction. Even though I found some of them boring or overly done, I still learnt something from them. 
 The five-paged bibliography at the end of the book shows well the thorough research undertaken by the author for this book. It is a book worth reading, and I'll certainly read more titles from Crichton. I have my mind on Jurassic Park next. Although I've seen the movie, I'd still love to experience the book side of it. 
 I recommend this book to any sci-fi and techno-thriller lover. If you like the science-goes-wrong genre, then this is the book for you.

Here, in his newest work, Sparks tells a story about making the greatest commitment of all...loving someone forever.
The Rescue
When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks - risks no one else in the department would ever take - to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate.
Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone.
During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love.
In The Rescue Nicholas Sparks weaves his inimitable spell, immersing us in the passions and the surprising complexities of modern relationships-and in doing so, teaching us something about our own.",Fiction,Intermediate,14,1,14,8.071428571428571,12,4.1,143722,4.0,Loved it.

They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become TullyandKate. Inseparable.
So begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Laneis the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the mainstay of their lives.

All Kate really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her...how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend....
For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship--jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart...and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.
Firefly Laneis for anyone who ever drank Boone's Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it's the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It's about promises and secrets and betrayals.

She's been stricken with something the old-timers call ""Milk Sickness.""
""My baby boy..."" she whispers before dying.
Only later will the grieving Abe learn that his mother's fatal affliction was actually the work of a vampire.
When the truth becomes known to young Lincoln, he writes in his journal, ""henceforth my life shall be one of rigorous study and devotion. I shall become a master of mind and body.

823,Freedom,Jonathan Franzen,2010,2010,"In his first novel since The Corrections, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Walter and Patty Berglund as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.
(from the back cover)",Fiction,Intermediate,19,1,15,8.517241379310345,14,3.73,516,4.0,"It's always hard to review a complete brick of a book (literally speaking), and this one is quite something. 
 Franzen has almost entirely adhered to the simple point-and-tell way of God informing the reader of what happens throughout the book, interspersed with a few character perspective moments. 
 Walter and Patty Berglund are a smart, suburban, modern married couple who are in turmoil and seemingly cannot come to terms with this. They avoid each other rather, avoiding their issues apart from when they fight, which is like a cold, staged play, reminiscent of Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"" in some affects. 
 Franzen's main strengths are the storytelling, the parallel plots and treating the reader like an intelligent person. At the same time, the best bits of this book read way better than a very long episode of ""Desperate Housewives"", which it often reminded me of. At its worst, the book reminded me of a very long, outstretched and bloated episode of ""Desperate Housewives"". 
 Some might say this book pin-points the human condition of relationships in modern-day western civilisation, and I'll say it does to a certain extent. Franzen is very good at writing matter-of-factly when it comes to describing human emotions which I think works to his advantage: the reader is allowed to think for herself/himself and the characters of the book come out a lot differently than if Franzen would have applied sappy adjectives throughout. 
 All in all, this is a big book, and I think its flaws and brilliance is part of what it's all about: people's inner worlds, as felt inside and projected outside.

 Contrast this with a review i wrote in Dec 1983, before I was a Christian: 
 'An inspirational novel. 
 Its about Jonathan, a seagull, who more than anything wanted to perfect flying, which meant being an outcast from the regular flock who did not believe in flying for flying sake alone. 
 In Jonathan's search for that perfect speed, he discovers there are no limitations as there are no limitations to the perfection of the human soul. Perfection is being there. he learns of the freedom from and time and space, that is, in the here and now.

The summer that Nixon resigns, six teenagers at a summer camp for the arts become inseparable. Decades later the bond remains powerful, but so much else has changed. In The Interestings, Wolitzer follows these characters from the height of youth through middle age, as their talents, fortunes, and degrees of satisfaction diverge.
The kind of creativity that is rewarded at age fifteen is not always enough to propel someone through life at age thirty; not everyone can sustain, in adulthood, what seemed so special in adolescence.

Her friend Jonah, a gifted musician, stops playing the guitar and becomes an engineer.

It's one of those classics I'd always intended to read, and with my interest in nuclear apocalypse, one would have thought I'd have read it earlier, but, well, nope. It wasn't until I saw the rather fantastic documentary Fallout about the novel and the film that I remembered it existed, and that I'd never read it. 
 I don't know what there is to say that hasn't been said. I really liked the characters' total inability to accept what the future held, the planning and holding on, and in some cases the total rewriting of the truth. It reminded me in some aspects of the scene in The Time Machine where the Time Traveller finds the museum and muses on the futility of all human endeavour, except that this is a much more visceral rendering of that desperate sense of clutching something that is not going to last. There was a strong sense of country Victoria in the narrative; in the reactions of the characters especially. I was tearful by the end; I think it's hard to get to the end of a book like this and not tear up. 
 One of the things that Fallout says is that a surprising number of world leaders read this, and counted it amongst their favourite novels. I can see why, if only for its bleak warning; still, I don't think we use newspapers intelligently still, and as a denizen of the Southern Hemisphere, I can all-too-easily see destruction wrought upon us down here by our neighbours in the north.",0.0,0,106,589.36,5.56,1251,1,4,5

Stephen King's most gripping and unforgettable novel, Bag of Bones,is a story of grief and a lost love's enduring bonds, of a new love haunted by the secrets of the past, of an innocent child caught in a terrible crossfire.
Set in the Maine territory King has made mythic, Bag of Bonesrecounts the plight of forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan, who is unable to stop grieving even four years after the sudden death of his wife, Jo, and who can no longer bear to face the blank screen of his word processor.
Now his nights are plagued by vivid nightmares of the house by the lake. Despite these dreams, or perhaps because of them, Mike finally returns to Sara Laughs, the Noonans' isolated summer home.
He finds his beloved Yankee town familiar on its surface, but much changed underneath--held in the grip of a powerful millionaire, Max Devore, who twists the very fabric of the community to his purpose: to take his three-year-old granddaughter away from her widowed young mother.
As Mike is drawn into their struggle as he falls in love with both of them, he is also drawn into the mystery of Sara Laughs, now the site of ghostly visitations, ever-escalating nightmares, and the sudden recovery of his writing ability. What are the forces that have been unleashed here--and what do they want of Mike Noonan?
As vivid and enthralling as King's most enduring works, Bag of Bonesresonates with what Amy Tan calls ""the witty and obsessive voice of King's powerful imagination.""

In Bag of Bones--described by Gloria Naylor as ""a love story about the dark places within us all""--he proves to be one of our most moving.",Fiction,Intermediate,20,1,16,6.05,4,3.87,79,4.0,This was definitely a book that I could not put down and it took me forever to start it because it was so long.

 Becky is trying to navigate her first year of being married to Luke. They seem to be falling out of sync ever since they have come back from their honeymoon. One of my favorite things about this series is the fact that it doesn't revolve around the romance of Luke and Becky. 
 The relationships between Becky and her best friend Suze and the new one with her sister, Jess were the highlight of this book. Suze has been Becky's best friend for years, but they now find it hard to connect. They are at just two different part of their lives. They have such a believable friendship. I was rooting for them the entire time. 
 I really liked the struggle between Jess and Becky. These are two very, very different women.They constantly butting heads. They had some of the funniest dialogue and unbelievable scenarios. 
 I can't get enough of this series. 
 I give this book a B+",0.0,0,4400,13156.000000000002,2.99,1059,3,3,4
858,The Boston Girl,Anita Diamant,2014,2014,"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Red Tent and Day After Night, comes an unforgettable coming-of-age novel about family ties and values, friendship and feminism told through the eyes of a young Jewish woman growing up in Boston in the early twentieth century.
Addie Baum is The Boston Girl, born in 1900 to immigrant parents who were unprepared for and suspicious of America and its effect on their three daughters. Growing up in the North End, then a teeming multicultural neighborhood, Addie's intelligence and curiosity take her to a world her parents can't imagine - a world of short skirts, movies, celebrity culture and new opportunities for women. Addie wants to finish high school and dreams of going to college. She wants a career and to find true love.
Eighty-five-year-old Addie tells the story of her life to her twenty-two-year-old granddaughter, who has asked her ""How did you get to be the woman you are today?"" She begins in 1915, the year she found her voice and made friends who would help shape the course of her life. From the one-room tenement apartment she shared with her parents and two sisters, to the library group for girls she joins at a neighborhood settlement house, to her first, disastrous love affair, Addie recalls her adventures with compassion for the naive girl she was and a wicked sense of humor.
Written with the same attention to historical detail and emotional resonance that made Anita Diamant's previous novels bestsellers, The Boston Girl is a moving portrait of one woman's complicated life in twentieth-century America, and a fascinating look at a generation of women finding their places in a changing world.",Fiction,Intermediate,12,6,15,11.583333333333334,7,3.79,53055,4.0,"I really enjoyed this book, much more than I thought.

 Meh. I borrowed Gone from the library due to it's intriuging cover and the fact that a friend had specifically not recommended it to me, saying I'd hate it. I decided to read it anyways, going in with a positive attitude and hoping to prove her wrong. Unfortunately, she knew me too well. 
 As I've mentioned several times in previous reviews, I love original and refreshing plots and characters. Gone lacked both of these. Knowing that the novel was about a student-teacher romance I expected high-stakes and angst but instead it was causal, bland, and boring. I ended up finding Connor's neighbours' and friends' lives more interesting than Connor's. His mother's alcoholism was random and didn't really affect the plot other than to isolate Connor from his family, which I guess may have led Connor to seek companionship in Corrina? One of the most poorly written aspects was the romance between Corinna and Connor. I didn't understand the initial attraction or the sexual tension. I thought it was really juvenile and unrealistic that they'd fall in love with each other in only a week and become so intimate so quickly. This was definitely not an accurate representation of how relationships, let alone studen-teacher relationships evolve. 
 I think Kathleen Jeffrie Johnson tried to tackle too many issues in such a short novel and it ended up as a jumble in the end. Alcoholism, death, teenage romance, sexuality, student-teacher relationships, drug abuse, loneliness, abuse, etc. are all very controversial and tough issuse to conquer individually let alone all in th same novel. I wish that Connor's thought process had been more clearly explained, for example if he had compared his relationship to Zach and Risa's and seen the differences for him and Corrina the reader might have understood why he wanted to move with her so badly. In novels like this it's so hard to write an ending that applies to each of these topics so in the end Kathleen focused on isolation (hence the title ""Gone"") which may have worked as a final chapter if there weren't so many other pressing issues and logistics left unfinished. 
 Despite not liking the overall novel there were a few points I did enjoy. I thought it was very creative to have the student-teacher romance not take place during the school year or on school property but rather in the summer, where the chances of being caught and the repurcussions were a bit different. I liked how Corinna was an average formally-troubled woman who happened to fall in love with a student as opposed to a sensual provocative woman lurring every male at school. The fact that she was as isolated and naive as Connor made her seem more like a fellow student than someone almost 10 years older than him.",0.0,0,670,3678.3,5.49,166,2,3,2

863,White Teeth,Zadie Smith,2000,2001,"On New Year's morning, 1975, Archie Jones sits in his car on a London road and waits for the exhaust fumes to fill his Cavalier Musketeer station wagon. Archie--working-class, ordinary, a failed marriage under his belt--is calling it quits, the deciding factor being the flip of a 20-pence coin. When the owner of a nearby halal butcher shop (annoyed that Archie's car is blocking his delivery area) comes out and bangs on the window, he gives Archie another chance at life and sets in motion this richly imagined, uproariously funny novel.
Epic and intimate, hilarious and poignant, White Teethis the story of two North London families--one headed by Archie, the other by Archie's best friend, a Muslim Bengali named Samad Iqbal. Pals since they served together in World War II, Archie and Samad are a decidedly unlikely pair. Plodding Archie is typical in every way until he marries Clara, a beautiful, toothless Jamaican woman half his age, and the couple have a daughter named Irie (the Jamaican word for ""no problem""). Samad --devoutly Muslim, hopelessly ""foreign""-- weds the feisty and always suspicious Alsana in a prearranged union. They have twin sons named Millat and Magid, one a pot-smoking punk-cum-militant Muslim and the other an insufferable science nerd. The riotous and tortured histories of the Joneses and the Iqbals are fundamentally intertwined, capturing an empire's worth of cultural identity, history, and hope.
Zadie Smith's dazzling first novel plays out its bounding, vibrant course in a Jamaican hair salon in North London, an Indian restaurant in Leicester Square, an Irish poolroom turned immigrant cafe, a liberal public school, a sleek science institute. A winning debut in every respect, White Teethmarks the arrival of a wondrously talented writer who takes on the big themes --faith, race, gender, history, and culture-- and triumphs.",Fiction,Intermediate,3,14,16,15.0,5,3.75,84311,5.0,"On of my favorite books of all time.

---Ken Bruen, author of The Dramatist
""'Jumpers,' McCallum was saying. 'Jumpers are---well, in my experience jumpers are always badly disturbed. They choose to jump because it's so violent.'""
The body of Niall Howley, a young man with golden hair, is found at the base of the Telstra Tower---the famed communications tower atop Canberra's Black Mountain. Local authorities are content to accept Niall's death as a straightforward suicide. But his apparent ""suicide note"" leaves many unanswered questions.
The note is an image on Niall's computer screen---a digitalized image of himself sprawled at the bottom of cliff . . . an exact replica of the positioning of his body as it was found near the Telstra Tower. Desperate for answers, and fearing murder, his mother seeks out the help of Sandra Mahoney, a computer crime consultant.
Niall had been---until recently---an integral member in a role-playing internet game---and his suicide turns out to be bizarre echo of his own character's death. Niall's death, and its connection to the fate of his internet character force Mahoney to reexamine every angle.
While juggling her own baby daughter, a Russian lover, a needy dog, and a plaguing ex-husband, Sandra races across the globe in pursuit of truth on behalf of a mother who wants to know how a game killed her son. And finds that the threads of truth and illusion can easily wind into a game of manipulation and deceit.
Australian author Dorothy Johnston returns with the second book featuring Inspector Sandra Mahoney; in a thrilling and intelligent mystery that searches for one mother's truth.

Daughter of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain, Katherine has been fated her whole life to marry Prince Arthur of England. When they meet and are married, the match becomes as passionate as it is politically expedient. The young lovers revel in each other's company and plan the England they will make together. But tragically, aged only fifteen, Arthur falls ill and extracts from his sixteen-year-old bride a deathbed promise to marry his brother, Henry; become Queen; and fulfill their dreams and her destiny.

For seven years, she endures the treachery of spies, the humiliation of poverty, and intense loneliness and despair while she waits for the inevitable moment when she will step into the role she has prepared for all her life. Then, like her warrior mother, Katherine must take to the battlefield and save England when its old enemies the Scots come over the border and there is no one to stand against them but the new Queen.

It's one of those classics I'd always intended to read, and with my interest in nuclear apocalypse, one would have thought I'd have read it earlier, but, well, nope. It wasn't until I saw the rather fantastic documentary Fallout about the novel and the film that I remembered it existed, and that I'd never read it. 
 I don't know what there is to say that hasn't been said. I really liked the characters' total inability to accept what the future held, the planning and holding on, and in some cases the total rewriting of the truth. It reminded me in some aspects of the scene in The Time Machine where the Time Traveller finds the museum and muses on the futility of all human endeavour, except that this is a much more visceral rendering of that desperate sense of clutching something that is not going to last. There was a strong sense of country Victoria in the narrative; in the reactions of the characters especially. I was tearful by the end; I think it's hard to get to the end of a book like this and not tear up. 
 One of the things that Fallout says is that a surprising number of world leaders read this, and counted it amongst their favourite novels.

""I'm back...I'm back from the dead and you don't seem glad to see me at all, you ungrateful son of a bitch.""
After thirteen years of international bestseller stardom with his works of violent crime fiction, author George Stark is officially declared dead--revealed by a national magazine to have been killed at the hands of the man who created him: the once well-regarded but now obscure writer Thad Beaumont. Thad's even gone so far as to stage a mock burial of his wildly successful pseudonym, complete with tombstone and the epitaph ""Not a Very Nice Guy."" Although on the surface, it seems that Thad can finally concentrate on his own novels, there's a certain unease at the prospect of leaving George Stark behind. But that's nothing compared to the horror about to descend upon Thad's new life. There are the vicious, out-of-control nightmares, for starters. And how is he able to explain the fact that everyone connected to George Stark's untimely demise is now meeting a brutal end of their own in a pattern of homicidal savagery...and why each blood-soaked crime scene has Thad's fingerprints all over it? Thad Beaumont may have once believed that George Stark was running out of things to say, but he's going to find out just how wrong he is...

903,Inferno,Dan Brown,2013,1996,"Uniting the most powerful energies of popular culture and the magnificent gothic edifice of Medieval scholasticism, Dante created a new language that combined an intense lyricism with the intellectual seriousness demanded of his project - nothing less than the creation of a Christian epic addressed to the common reader. Dante's synthesis of epic with lyric has bequeathed to modern artists and translators a permanent imperative to translate his art into contemporary, living speech. In this new translation of the Inferno, Elio Zappulla successfully re-creates the immediacy, directness, and psychological force of Dante's original text. Zappulla's faithfulness to Dante's Italian is matched by an executed commitment to convey to today's reader, through the lyrical cadences of everyday American English, the emotional and aesthetic impact of what he calls Dante's ""complex simplicity."" At the same time, the reader is never allowed to lose sight of the Inferno's intellectual majesty and moral grandeur.",Fiction,Intermediate,29,1,16,5.724137931034483,6,3.99,215,5.0,"I understand there is nothing new I can say about this classic. What I can do is offer my experience of reading Dante's opus, to hope that by writing the review much more will be revealed to me of my reading than I know here at the start. I imagine I will offer much speculation which has probably been speculated upon for eons. But for me speculation is at the heart of reading and of writing. There is no Virgil to guide me-us. On our own let's step into The Inferno. 
 Homage is due for this epic scripted within verse form. Nowhere was the work constrained, contained, by the form. Rather, the form bred the words and opened the visage of the work. I would have to call this feat...well, sorry... but Dantesque. Comparisons here are lacking. 
 The Inferno begins with Dante lost in the woods and coming to a fork in the path. Realizing he has strayed from what is meaningful in his life he acknowledges the appearance of the poet Virgil who encourages him to take the path guarded by a Leopard, a Lion, a She-Devil. Virgil pledges his protection as this path will initially lead to walking downward through the tiers of hell before the climb can take place where Dante may finally meet Beatrice. 
 During the travel through hell, a visitation of the sins of mankind and their punishments, Dante seems young or younger than my image of the icon, fearful and vulnerable. Understandably so in that the horrific crimes of the sinner often incur punishments well beyond gruesome. Many have crossed the blood line into the sadistic. I have a strong stomach for things like this but there were a number of situations, as hard as I tried, I could not identify with and experience the sinners continuing pain and torment. I hid behind the words, intellect. 
 Was this a firm and harrowing statement of Dante, the monstrous images embedded within the mind kindling a deep burnt scarring of fear, in order to herd those outside the faithful into the church's fold? 
 But here's where I had a problem. As I wandered with Virgil and Dante denial fell rapidly away leaving the gore and guts of tortures of punishment more hideous than the crimes of the sinners. Who was the architect of this horrendous regimen and why? What was Dante telling me here; the Dante as a character within the book, our narrator, and/or the Dante writing the book, our author? Is this a comment on how much greater is the power of the authorities and therefore the suffering that can be looked forward to if one steps outside of moral rectitude, and the balance owed to the State, the burly sack filled with conventions? I suppose this young(er) anxious Dante within the book was there to not only take me along on his precarious journey under the safe guidance of Virgil, but to point out in the most vivid stomach churning way how the church had grown too powerful with its fear mongering, the State with its continual wars, the lure, compulsion, to turn away from one's life. Virgil, the standard-bearer of reason, is taking Dante through the witnessing of these atrocities, what lies within humans, their hearts in hidden byways, in Dante's, so he can begin to regain his own life of meaning? 
 It is nothing new that all of us, including our young Dante, is capable of the full menu of atrocities. However, by locking this repulsive knowledge in the rust hinged chest of repression only leads to further and escalated expression. Virgil has led Dante down into the realm of his unconscious? There he witnesses his own devastating impulses and its consequent suffering? When they reach the end of hell they begin an ardous climb, Virgil always leading the way, toward a light above.

After all, it includes such amazing tales as The Mist and The Jaunt. It must be amazeballs, right? Not so much. Even the epically awesome stories in this collection need to be trimmed down. Most of them start slower than a Lars Von Trier movie, and over half of them never really pay off. There are some serious WTF stories within this collection; stories I didn't understand ten years ago and still do not understand today. In other words, the reread didn't help.

It does not mean you will not understand the Milkman stories or appreciate King's cute-ass poem about anthropomorphized fruit that he wrote for his youngest son Owen. I understand why they are in this collection, but that doesn't mean I have to like them. Mostly, this collection is tedious. But, some of the time, if you can wade through the first unmpteen pages of bullshit, you might find a scare or two, or a meaningful story surrounded by bloat. 
 Here are my one-sentence reviews of each story. Feel free to discuss your favorites in the comment section. 
 The Mist - Five epically-awesome stars for this tale of mist-borne monsters and flawed fathers. 
 Here There Be Tygers - Three stars for this story about toileting ""tygers"" and tasty teachers. 
 The Monkey - Two stars for this mostly mediocre, meandering monkey, because this one has never really scared me, but it sure has bored me. 
 Cain Rose Up - Three confused stars because I don't know why this story is still in publication and Rage is not. 
 Mrs. Todd's Shortcut - Four stars for what could be the inspiration for Lisey's Story, because Boo'ya Moon could very well be Mrs. Todd's escape route. 
 The Jaunt - Five stars for this tale that takes cues from The Langoliers. 
 The Wedding Gig - Four stars for this story that fits the Hard Case Crimes series better than both The 
 Colorado Kid and Joyland put together. 
 Paranoid: A Chant - I'm sure this piece is brilliant and I'm just too stupid to understand it, but yeah, one star. 
 The Raft - All the stars (Five, Six... Ten... a Hundred) for what continues to be one of my favorite stories of all time. 
 The Word Processor of the Gods - Gets three stars for being The Monkey's Paw with a happy ending. 
 The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands - Finds three stars because the boys from 249B East 35th are still telling tales, even after Emlyn McCarron told them about The Breathing Method. 
 Beachworld - Beachfront property this ain't, but one helluva four-star story it is. 
 The Reaper's Image - This three-star story seems like the inspiration for that horrible Oculus movie. 
 Nona - Gets four-stars for being darkly dubious. 
 For Owen - If I were King's kid I would expect something better than this two-star cutesy crap from my old man. 
 Survivor Type - While you'll never see Richard Pine on Food Network, his cooking gets five stars. 
 Uncle Otto's Truck - Two stars for this done-to-death concept about a killer car. 
 Morning Deliveries (Milkman #1) - One star for this outline of an idea for a possible short story. 
 Big Wheels: A Tale of the Laundry Game (Milkman #2) - If someone would like to explain this story and its predecessor to me, I might give it more than one star. 
 Gramma - Four-stars for this creepy motherfucker because the beginning is slow as hell, but that ending... *shivers* 
 The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet - This one starts even slower than Gramma but its payoff only raises it into three-star territory. 
 The Reach - Stephen King says he wants to be remembered for this four-star beauty of a story, but he's done much better, at least in my opinion he has. 
 In summation: Skeleton Crew has a few gems, but is, overall, just okay.

Halloween is a wild, weird night in the lonely moorland towns of the north. It's dark and cold, and cracks can open up in the fabric of the safest world.
Davey Bell has been trying to live safely. He's struggled through a rough adolescence and has a decent job, a home of his own. He agrees to a meeting with his ex, even though Burdo got him into so much trouble in the past.
But Burdo has plans, armed robbery amongst them. When Davey recoils from his efforts at blackmail, Burdo swears he'll track him down. There's something inhuman about Burdo's rage, and Davey panics and runs from him. The town is small, the darkness beyond it absolute. Davey has lived there all his life, but he takes a wrong turn on the moorland road and is suddenly lost.
It's the first night of winter, and set to freeze hard. Not much chance of survival for a man without shelter, a man on the run from his past... Then Davey stumbles into the forest, and his fears of Burdo and the cold dissolve to nothing at the sound of deep, bestial growls.
The moon is full. Ancient moorland legends are coming to life in its silvery radiance. Out of the woodland steps a strange young man, and the snarling beasts fall back. He's offering sanctuary, but at what price? He's the most beautiful creature Davey has ever seen. If Davey follows him in fascination through the gateway of Wolf Hall, what secrets will unfold before the dawn?

Then as the book progressed, I found two of my big pet peeves: adults that don't confront their parents when they're out of line and the demonizing of men. You see, I had a mother like Min's so I totally understand what it is to live with constant criticism regarding my figure. But when I was in my 20s, I had a very firm chat with my Mom about it and told her I wouldn't tolerate that behavior. Did my Mother stop completely? Of course not, but at least now it's manageable and not humiliating like it used to be. And that's why I cannot respect Min who at 33-years old, should not let her mother choose her hairdo, her clothes or the food she eats. 
 I HATED how Cal was demonized because he dated a lot. He was so nice and thoughtful that women fell in love with him in droves and when he realized they were more serious than him, he would break up with them. The bastard! Doesn't he know that once a woman falls in love with him, he owes her a ring no matter his feelings? He made them fall in love! It's his fault! Because you know, women are little girls that cannot take responsibility for their own feelings and must get every man they want. **Throwing up now** 
 Then the ending was so saccharine, I don't think I'll eat anything sweet for a month. 
 The narration was good but I don't think that Cal's voice was distinctive enough. But what makes this narration really irritating is the author's writing style. Almost every line of dialogue ends in 'he said' or 'she said' so after a while, I wanted to shoot myself. I had to speed up this book a lot, just to see if I could stop hearing 'so and so said' after every sentence. 
 Because I liked the humor, I was thinking that I should give this author another shot, but then I thought that for the first time ever, an author has put me off food. If nothing else, that's my clue that I should never read anything by this author again. She's liable to make me swear off bread or chocolate and THAT I couldn't stand.",120.0,1,106,846.94,7.99,1266,1,2,2
911,Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,Susanna Clarke,2004,2006,"Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative - the very opposite of Mr. Norrell. Astonished to find another practicing magician in early 1800s England, Mr. Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Norrell, their power is something to be controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the shadowy, ancient figure of the Raven King, the most legendary magician of all. Eventually, Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything he holds dear.",Fiction,Intermediate,11,3,14,9.272727272727272,1,3.8,22,5.0,"There are so many things to say about this book. So many things I want to say, so many things I wish I remembered to say. But, the first thing that comes to mind is that it's amazing. Likely one of the best books I've read this year. It's a bit long and a good portion of it could have been cut out, but I loved how absorbed I got in the world. I listened to it at work. I listened to it on my way home from work. I listened to it on my way home from school. I listened to this over the weekend while I was doing chores. 
 All of the characters, in their own way, were likeable and unlikeable. I rooted for all of them at some point and time, then I rooted against them at others. I don't think I can think of any other book where I've had that unique feeling. 
 Not only that but the tone of the book is perfect. It captures the old feel of Georgian times. Then, it captures the slightly mysterious and bewitching feeling that England has, specifically older England because this book is a mix of Georgian and the early Plantagenet rule to it. Then, there's the slightly creepy feel of magic to it. Basically, the perfect book for October since it really feels creepy, mysterious, and bewitching. 
 Definitely one of the best books I've read this year and I'm going to have to get a copy to actually read it instead of just listen to it like I did this time.",7.0,1,700,5593.0,7.99,160,2,2,2
912,The Broker,John Grisham,2005,2006,"In his final hours in the Oval Office, the outgoing President grants a controversial last-minute pardon to Joel Backman, a notorious Washington power broker who has spent the last six years hidden away in a federal prison. What no one knows is that the President issues the pardon only after receiving enormous pressure from the CIA. It seems Backman, in his power broker heyday, may have obtained secrets that compromise the world's most sophisticated satellite surveillance system.
Backman is quietly smuggled out of the country in a military cargo plane, given a new name, a new identity, and a new home in Italy. Eventually, after he has settled into his new life, the CIA will leak his whereabouts to the Israelis, the Russians, the Chinese, and the Saudis. Then the CIA will do what it does best: sit back and watch. The question is not whether Backman will survive, there is no chance of that. The question the CIA needs answered is, who will kill him?

Then, the authorities of various countries sit back and monitor him as they wait to see who will get to him first..... 
 This was a great read and kept me hooked until the end. The danger the main character was in felt real and exposed the potential power plays going on at the highest levels of American government and within the intelligence systems. 
 I wasn't as interested in the well researched history of Italy and the various Italian words and phrases that are included in the narrative but this might be a bonus for some people. 
 As with most of Grisham's books, there are a few swear words, some violence and some sexual innuendo. There is nothing grossly offensive or especially graphic.

913,The Storyteller,Harold Robbins,1986,2012,"Anna and Abel couldn't be more different. They are both seventeen and in their last year of school, but while Anna lives in a nice old town house and comes from a well-to-do family, Abel, the school drug dealer, lives in a big, prisonlike tower block at the edge of town. Anna is afraid of him until she realizes that he is caring for his six-year-old sister on his own. Fascinated, Anna follows the two and listens as Abel tells little Micha the story of a tiny queen assailed by dark forces. It's a beautiful fairy tale that Anna comes to see has a basis in reality. Abel is in real danger of losing Micha to their abusive father and to his own inability to make ends meet. Anna gradually falls in love with Abel, but when his enemies begin to turn up dead, she fears she has fallen for a murderer. Has she? Award-winning author Antonia Michaelis moves in a bold new direction with her latest novel: a dark, haunting, contemporary story that is part mystery, part romance, and part melodrama.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,8,15,9.058823529411764,4,4.1,107,5.0,"""I'm not answering any questions,"" he said, smiling. ""I'm not one of the answering people. I'm the storyteller."" 
 Abel Tannatek is the storyteller. He is a young man hiding an ugly reality behind pretty words and magical happenings. 
 In order to find out what he is hiding, we are forced to slowly watch as the layers of his true self are revealed, one ugly layer at a time. Secrets are the only method of survival in a world where you can count on no one but yourself. Secrets are the only choice you have when you must protect the life of an innocent. 
 Enter Anna. Sheltered, clueless Anna. She has no idea of the darkness and danger outside of her safe little world. 
 It's late, Anna...they'll be waiting for you, at home...in that house where the air is always blue...they'll be worried. 
 A chance meeting between the school's drug dealer and an innocent, sheltered student came about because of a lost doll. Had Anna not found the doll, she would have carried on her life as usual. There would be no danger, no mystery, no killing for her to know about. One might say that finding the doll was the worst thing that could have happened to her. I would disagree. 
 Abel is a broken human being. He's broken to the point of ill repair, yet Anna still sees something in him that's worth saving. As we see Abel through Anna's eyes, we are shown just how much a person will endure in order to spare a life so precious to him - the life of a tiny little girl in a pink jacket. 
 Abel and Anna bond through time shared as Abel spins wonderful fairytales into existence for his younger sister. Real life becomes the backdrop for the fantasy. Characters in reality become characters in the story. A mystery starts to unfold as characters in the story become bigger players in crimes which start taking place in the real world. Who is the killer? Why does Abel seem to have so much to hide? Why are other people interested in what Abel and Anna are up to? 
 I can't divulge much without going into spoiler territory. The Storyteller is so beautifully written. The depth of character and layers of detail are heart-breakingly intricate. After I finished, I was left with a few different emotions. Anger and sadness were probably the two most prominent, but I can't say that I have any regrets reading this book. I had a hard time putting my reader down because the story of Abel and Anna was such a pull. 
 As for the character flaws...I suppose I should address those. Both Abel and Anna disappointed me in a way because of their actions, yet I felt as if their actions made them more real. Abel was abused, so he had no other experience to draw from in learning how to interact with others. Anna had an empty but satisfactory life and she craved more than her own existence inside of a pretty box. Abel was able to give her something she'd never had before and because of this, she was quick to forgive at times when others wouldn't. Right or wrong, I understood why.",56.0,1,435,430.65,0.99,239,1,2,2

He was much thinner and his face had been altered. He spoke a different language, and spoke it very well.
But Danilo had a past with many chapters. Four years earlier he had been Patrick Lanigan, a young partner in a prominent Biloxi law firm. He had a pretty wife, a new daughter, and a bright future.

While many hold up ""Catcher in the Rye"" as the zenith of his achievements for me it will always be this wistful and brave little book. I re-read it two or three times or year. I love it that much. 
 To be honest out of the nine stories collected here I would say that only a third are Salinger's best. ""Perfect Day for Banafish,"" ""For Esme - With Love and Squalor,"" and ""The Laughing Man"" are to me the peaks of short fiction. Everything that Salinger does best he does in these three tales. Nobody wrote children better than him. They leap off the page at you right into your lap. Esme, her brother, Seymour's little friend and the narrator of ""Laughing Man"" are so vivid and real you feel like running them all down the street for ice cream and cake. They are that true to life. 
 Same goes for Seymour in ""Banana Fish"" and the narrator of ""For Esme."" Nobody got into the heads of brilliant but troubled young people better than Salinger. What we hear about Seymour as opposed to what we see creates a palpable (and beautiful)tension. The narrator of ""For Esme""'s war inflicted emotional problems are drawn with such artistry as to flood over you as you read. 
 ""Uncle Wiggly in Connecticut,"" ""Daumier-Smith's Blue Period,"" and ""War with the Eskimos"" to me fall into the ""damn entertaining but not great"" category. These stories are beautifully observed, funny, poignant and always a pleasure to read but lack that magic the first three have to spare. Of course that being said even being good but not great Salinger makes them better than most. 
 Finally ""Teddy,"" ""Down in the Dinghy"" and ""Pretty Mouth Green My Eyes"" are good stories but I feel they suffer from being collected in the same book as the others. Each alone is enthralling but not a one of them is a patch on ""Esme,"" or ""Bananafish."" Where the other stories feel like a full meal these come off more like snacks. Tasty but not quite filling. 
 If you like Salinger and want to read something by him that won't make you want to shoot a president or a sixties rock star this my friend is the book for you.",55.0,1,540,2154.6,3.99,192,2,1,1

I found myself quickly engaged in the storyline and invested in every character. I don't want to spoil anything about the story itself, so I'll sum up my review with one of the many things I took from this book: 
 Is there bad in the world? 
 Yes. 
 Does the good in the world outweigh the bad? 
 Yes, Yes, Yes! 
 Thank you Ms. Moyes for the reminder. 
 Ms. Moyes gently restores our faith in humanity through the eyes of multiple perspectives. The characters remind us that optimism is the only thing that keeps us going sometimes, even though that light can so easily diminish in us all. If you believe that triumph over circumstances is possible, then read One Plus One. I'm so glad I did!

Ipak, teorije o tome sto se imalo dogoditi 2012. bile su dosta zanimljive. Ova knjiga predstavlja jednu od tih teorija, zbog cega me i privukla. 
 Ocekivala sam pustolovinu i postupno otkrice drevnih misterija, ali, nazalost, od drevnih civilizacija i njihovih prorocanstava ovdje nije bilo skoro nicega. Citava prica radi se o Maxu - djecaku koji je u 15. godini dozivio izvantjelesno iskustvo u kojem je vidio dvanaest imena koja ce imati neku ulogu u dogadaju koji se ima dogoditi 21.12.2012., a koji bi trebao promijeniti svijet. Ovu cinjenicu doznajemo vec u prvih 40-ak stranica, ali na bilo sto povezano s njome morat cemo cekati, i cekati, i cekati... Ja osobno nisam to docekala jer sam odustala na polovici knjige, a evo i zasto: 
 Prica je jako dosadna. Sve se vrti oko Maxa, koji je takoder dosadan. Takoder, i neuvjerljiv i sam sebi suprotan. Npr. odmah na pocetku autor govori kako je Max imao sjajno djetinjstvo. Divno! Nije moglo biti bolje! I onda, usput, spomene dogadaj iz tog predivnog Maxovog djetinjstva u kojem je Max odlucio oduzeti si zivot nozem, ali je od toga na kraju odustao. (?!) Osim toga, buduci da autor spominje i kako ga je stariji brat Louis neprestano terorizirao, sumnjam da je Maxovo djetinjstvo bilo tako nevjerojatno sjajno. Sam Max je, ili bi barem to trebao biti, neki genijalac. 'Uspjesan matematicar', kako ga autor opisuje. Osobno, nisam nigdje vidjela niti jednu povezanost Maxa i matematike iz koje bi to bilo vidljivo, a jedina cinjenica koja bi trebala ici u prilog Maxovoj navodnoj genijalnosti je ta da je na fakultetu napisao esej u kojem je dosao do ""izvanrednog"" otkrica kako 'A i jest i nije A', sto je zapravo teorija koja je vec odavno poznata i u matematici, i u filozofiji, i u brojnim drugim granama znanosti, tako da je jedino sto je Max zapravo ovdje otkrio, po mom misljenju, bila topla voda. 
 Max ne radi nista osim sto neprestano putuje. I dok se u nekim knjigama u kojima ima putovanja, dok citas, mozes osjetiti kao da si i sam tamo, ovdje, za mene, to nije bio slucaj. Nisam imala dojam kao da autor stvarno zna o cemu govori dok prica o svim tim zemljama i njihovim znamenitostima niti kao da je stvarno tamo bio u nekom razdoblju svoga zivota, vise sam dobila dojam kao da mi opisuje njihove razglednice. Takoder, sva ta Maxova putovanja u vecini su slucajeva posve nebitna za samu pricu, a prilicno je i nevjerojatno da je Max osoba koju uvijek odaberu za neko putovanje ili neki osobiti posao samo zbog toga sto on zna spanjolski. Jednostavno nigdje nisam uocila sto je to sto njega razlikuje od milijuna drugih ljudi koji govore spanjolski, a sto bi bilo tako vazno da bas on bude taj koji nesto treba napraviti. 
 Ni drugi likovi nisu bas vjerodostojni sami sebi. Primjerice, Maxova majka, koja je opisana kao osoba koja nimalo ne mari za vanjski izgled i nije ni najmanje tasta, a onda, nakon automobilske nesrece u kojoj zadobije ruzni oziljak preko lica i trajni tik, postane nesretna i svoju tugu zbog izgleda utapa u alkoholu i nevjeri. (?!) 
 S obzirom da nisam dosla do kraja knjige, ne znam kako se onih dvanaest imena uklapa u prorocanstvo o kraju svijeta, niti kakvo je to prorocanstvo zaista. U prvih 150 stranica o tome jedva ima dvije recenice. Ostatak romana ispunjava samo Max. Cime je to zasluzio, ne znam. Niti je zanimljiv, niti znacajan, niti ista cini, nema nikakve radnje.

 Well, Finnish Finnish Finnish because I loved I've Got Your Number and totally related to the main character, Poppy. I mean, who isn't absolutely, life-on-the-line dependent on their cell phone?

 Crickets on the last one? Well, FINE. You'd be surprised how easy it is to pull off though. 
 I've read every Kinsella book and pretty much enjoyed all of them, so I may be a bit biased. She's definitely my guilty pleasure read -- well, my innocent guilty pleasure. This was before I discovered smutty romances last year. (Hi, Victoria Dahl. Can't wait to read about the STUD FARM later this year!) I always appreciate the basic good nature of Kinsella's leads, even if they veer toward the ridiculous at times. Reading a Kinsella book is like catching up with an old girlfriend over drinks. You're not going to have deep, meaningful revelations over vodka martinis, but you will have fun. And most importantly, you will laugh your ass off.

 Om det ar nagot Mo Hayder kan sa ar det att skriva bocker som gar under skinnet pa en. Precis som Dennis Lehane sa vagar hon ta ut svangarna och det ar med isande fasa man laser varje sida. 
 Forsvunnen ar inget undantag. Att lasa om kidnappade barn ar hemskt och man vet inte om Jack Caffery kommer att lyckas radda situationen. Caffery ar en lysande polis, men i denna bok sa verkar det som om kidnapparen kan forutse polisen nasta drag och ju mer tiden gar desto mer lutar det at att det ar forsent, att flickan inte kommer att raddas. 
 Sedan har vi polisdykaren Flea Marley, som lever med konsekvenserna fran foregaende bok, vilket stor henne i jobbet. Hon vet inte om att Jack misstanker henne for ett brott som hon faktiskt ar oskyldig till men som i och med det Jack vet om det ter sig logiskt att han misstanker henne. Nu ger hon sig in kampen for att radda den kidnappade flickan. Men ar hon verkligen i form att ta sig an fallet? Kommer hon istallet bara att riskera sitt eget liv? 
 Forsvunnen ar en ruggig thriller dar den okande forovaren hela tiden lurar i bakgrunden och man sitter pa helspand pa slutet nar Caffery konfronterar forovaren. Fragan ar kommer allting att sluta lyckligt?

 ENGLISH REVIEW 
 If there is one thing Mo Hayder knows is it to write a book that crawls under your skin. She dares, just like Dennis Lehane can she write in such a way that it's with terror you turn each page. 
 Gone is no exception. Reading about kidnapped children is always terrible and you do not know if Jack Caffery will be able to save the kidnapped girl. Caffery is a brilliant police, but in this book, the kidnapper seems to anticipate every single move the police do, and as more time goes by, the fear grows that they will be too late. 
 Then we have police diver Flea Marley, who lives with the consequences from the previous book, which has consequences for her at work. She does not know that Jack suspects her for a crime she's actually innocent of. Although it's quite logical that he suspects her since he doesn't have the whole picture. Now she decides to search for the kidnapped girl. But, is she really in shape to help out? Or will she only risk her own life? 
 Gone is a tough thriller where the unidentified perpetrator always lurks in the background, and at the end, when Caffery confronts the perpetrator will you still question if everything will end happily...

 Another one-star book for the ""so bad it pissed me off"" category. I so wanted to like this book. Up until this book I think I read nearly everything Crichton wrote. 
 Timeline, in my opinion, had a great premise. Swashbuckler disguised as Sci-Fi. The problem I had was that Crichton tried too hard to explain his premises, and ended up making a jumble that even he couldn't untangle. 
 This book was supposed to have all the good stuff: time travel, knights, castles, fighting, suspense. But the characters don't ever really make it off the page. The bad guys are so one-dimensional, they are hard to hate. Good book hate requires conflict, and the bad guys are just so unrelentingly bad. Same issue with the good guys, the ""good"" guys are so boring, they're hard to root for. In the end, I didn't really care if they made it back okay. 
 Speaking of the ending, it all seemed like it was just tacked on because some editor said: ""Okay, you have to wrap this up in the next 40 pages, or it won't make a good movie script!"" They're all in this inextricable mess, but suddenly the tide turns completely in their favor for the ""good guys"" who repair the device at the last second, make it running, send the bad guys back to die horribly, and the two sympathetic couples live happily ever after with babies? Ha! 
 ...which is another thing that pissed me off. It seemed like Crichton was writing this just because it had been too long since he wrote a book that would ""make a great movie!"" (Thought the movie kind of sucked too.) And sure enough, it got optioned. bah. Don't you remember the days of amazing novels by Crichton?

On October 1, God is in His heaven, the stock market stands at 10,140, most of the planes are on time, and Clayton Riddell, an artist from Maine, is almost bouncing up Boylston Street in Boston. He's just landed a comic book deal that might finally enable him to support his family by making art instead of teaching it. He's already picked up a small (but expensive!) gift for his long-suffering wife, and he knows just what he will get for his boy Johnny. Why not a little treat for himself? Clay is feeling good about the future.
That changes in a hurry. The cause of the devastation is a phenomenon that will come to be known as The Pulse, and the delivery method is a cell phone. Everyone's cell phone. Clay and the few desperate survivors who join him suddenly find themselves in the pitch-black night of civilization's darkest age, surrounded by chaos, carnage, and a human horde that has been reduced to its basest nature...and then begins to evolve.
There is really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clay, an arrow points home to Maine, and as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north they begin to see crude signs confirming their direction. A promise, perhaps. Or a threat...
There are 193 million cell phones in the United States alone. Who doesn't have one? Stephen King's utterly gripping, gory, and fascinating novel doesn't just ask the question,Can you hear me now? It answers it with a vengeance.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,1,13,4.7,13,3.64,2582,4.0,"For some reason, I had seen quite a few bad reviews on Cell before I read it.

 The story centers around a mass event that turns anyone who happens to be on their cell phone at the time into a zombie. Mass chaos ensues and a small group of survivors bands together and tries to figure out what is going on and how to stop it. Some of the plot-line does have some similarity to The Stand, but the characters are fairly unique, the dialog is good, and the action keeps rolling along at a fairly brisk pace. 
 I really liked this novel. I knew that I probably would, but it was a nice surprise that it was as good as it was. I am of the opinion that not everything that Stephen King writes is destined to be a classic, but the majority of his work is well above average and I feel that one day he will be given his long overdue kudos and be placed in the literary canon with the other greats of modern literature.",32.0,1,1307,5933.78,4.54,80,2,4,2

The black, heart-shaped box that Coyne receives in the mail not only contains the suit of a dead man but also his vengeance-obsessed spirit. The ghost, it turns out, is the stepfather of a young groupie who committed suicide after the 54-year-old Coyne callously used her up and threw her away. Now, determined to kill Coyne and anyone who aids him, the merciless ghost of Craddock McDermott begins his assault on the rocker's sanity.",Fiction,Intermediate,7,6,16,11.571428571428571,13,3.82,66865,3.0,"When aging, retired rocker Judas Coyne buys a ghost on-line, he gets more than he bargained for, as the ghost, which arrives by way of a used suit in a heart-shaped box, is no benign spirit. I was most reminded of Freddie Krueger, as the hostile ghost sets out to destroy Coyne and all those he holds dear. I was not ecstatic early on about the premise, as I believed it was insufficient to sustain a book of this length. Although I have read better horror books, this one turned out well enough. What makes it special though is that Joe Hill just happens to be the son of none other than Stephen King. The apple remains in the orchard. The guy has talent, and I expect there will be much more product in the years to come as he follows in daddy's footsteps.

934,The Hours,Michael Cunningham,1999,1999,"In The Hours, Michael Cunningham, who is recognized as ""one of our very best writers"" (Richard Eder, Los Angeles Times), draw inventively on the life and work of Virginia Woolf to tell the story of a group of contemporary characters who are struggling with the conflicting claims of love and inheritance, hope and despair.
The novel opens with an evocation of Woolf's last days before her suicide in 1941, and moves to the stories of two modern American women who are trying to make rewarding lives for themselves in spite of the demands of friends, lovers, and family.
Clarissa Vaughan is a book editor who lives in present-day Greenwich Village; when we meet her, she is buying flowers to display at a party for her friend Richard, and ailing poet who has just won a major literary prize. Laura Brown is a housewife in postwar California who is bringing up her only son and looking for her true life outside of her stifling marriage.
With rare ease and assurance, Cunningham makes the two women's lives converge with Virginia Woolf's in an unexpected and heartbreaking way during the party for Richard. As the novel jump-cuts through the twentieth century, every line resonates with Cunningham's clear, strong, surprising lyrical contemporary voice.
Passionate, profound and deeply moving, The Hoursis Michael Cunningham's most remarkable achievement to date.",Fiction,Intermediate,3,8,12,10.666666666666666,7,3.92,956,3.0,"I hesitated between 3 and 4 stars for this book. It was beautifully written and has a somewhat unexpected (and yet unsurprising) ending. The references to Virginia Woolf are omnipresent as she also comes to life under Cunningham's pen along with Mrs Brown and ""Mrs Dalloway"". Yes, it did relight a flame in me to read the primary Woolf works (Orlando, Mrs Dalloway, To The Lighthouse, The Waves) and reminded me of the one I did read (A Room of One's Own), but still, something about it felt a little superficial. Was it the length (just 220 pages) and the relative ease with which I read it (less than 2 hours)? Or perhaps the heavily laden sentences that perhaps dipped low towards being pretentious? No, I have never seen the movie. And, yes, perhaps I should. But as a standalone novel, I have a hard time understanding why this one was chosen for the Pulitzer in 1997. Not having read either of the runner-ups (Cloudsplitter by Russel Banks about abolitionist John Brown or The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsiolver about the Belgian colonisation of the Congo), both were far longer and of considerably more depth in terms of historical scope from what I can tell. And yet, the Pulitzer committee settled on this short novel (nearly a novella). Well, I am not sure that I would have been in agreement and perhaps need to read the other two finalists to base a more consistent opinion. Regardless, I was not blown away by The Hours, but perhaps will read Flesh and Blood by this author as suggested by another reviewer here on GR.",83.0,1,5400,13500.0,2.5,449,4,3,2
935,Flight Behavior,Barbara Kingsolver,2012,2012,"Flight Behavior takes on one of the most contentious subjects of our time: climate change. With a deft and versatile empathy Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world.
Flight Behavior transfixes from its opening scene, when a young woman's narrow experience of life is thrown wide with the force of a raging fire. In the lyrical language of her native Appalachia, Barbara Kingsolver bares the rich, tarnished humanity of her novel's inhabitants and unearths the modern complexities of rural existence. Characters and reader alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory here, into the unsettled ground of science, faith, and everyday truces between reason and conviction.
Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen. Now, after a decade of domestic disharmony on a failing farm, she has settled for permanent disappointment but seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation with a younger man. As she hikes up a mountain road behind her house to a secret tryst, she encounters a shocking sight: a silent, forested valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand it as a cautionary miracle, but it sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists, religious leaders, and the media. The bewildering emergency draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists, opportunists, sightseers, and a striking biologist with his own stake in the outcome. As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle, Dellarobia confronts her family, her church, her town, and a larger world, in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed.
Flight Behavior takes on one of the most contentious subjects of our time: climate change. With a deft and versatile empathy Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world.",Fiction,Intermediate,8,3,13,9.75,2,3.76,58112,2.0,"I love Barbara Kingsolver. All of her books automatically go on my to-read list, because she's brilliant. One of the things I love about her is how unique her books are from one another. She writes different kind of characters in disparate environments and focuses on varying themes. I find it so impressive when authors can reinvent themselves so often. Flight Behavior is my fourth Kingsolver book. Unfortunately, unlike the others, this one failed to meet my expectations. 
 My first Kingsolver read was The Bean Trees, which centers around a girl desperate to get out of her small, hick town where most of the girls are pregnant before they even leave high school. She wants to be one of the ones to leave and never come back. Through some odd circumstances, she finds herself stuck raising a baby that's not hers, sort of falling into motherhood. The plot itself didn't have much appeal for me as a reader, but the book was utterly compelling and I loved it so much. Kingsolver's powerful writing and intriguing, quirky characters pulled me in despite myself. 
 In Flight Behavior, Kingsolver again focuses on a heroine who had dreams of escaping her hick town, but this one didn't make it. Dellarobia hoped to go to college, but wound up pregnant instead. Even worse, the baby boy died, leaving her stuck in a marriage with a man she doesn't respect and reliant on judgmental in-laws. Her unhappiness manifests itself in a wandering eye; she has had a number of crushes on men, flirted with the idea of an affair. The hook of the novel is when Dellarobia heads up the mountain to meet with one of her men and cheat on her husband. On her way, she sees the forest burning with butterflies, and interprets that as a sign from God that she needs to go back to her life and make good. 
 Dellarobia's life certainly is unfortunate, and it's such a shame that her promise was wasted on this small town, where kids only take two years of rudimentary math in school. Even the bright ones aren't given enough education to be able to get out of town. I feel for her, but I didn't connect with her or any of the other characters. In all of Kingsolver's previous works, I was held rapt in unfamiliar worlds by the power of the characters and the writing, but these characters simply failed to grab onto my heart and take hold. 
 Another problem too is that, while the writing is beautiful as always (and shows that you can not write in dialect but still achieve a southern feel), the story feels a bit like a combination of two of the Kingsolver books I'd previously read: The Bean Trees and Prodigal Summer. Revisiting old themes, while not what I know Kingsolver for, can be done well, but, in this case, it felt repetitive and less well done. 
 Flight Behavior feels like it was written not so much for the characters as to be the vehicle for a message: global warming is real and it's not just about changing temperatures. Now, of course, it's alright for books to have a moral, a message, but I don't like to feel like I'm being beat over the head with it or being talked down to. 
 The butterflies Dellarobia witnessed normally wintered in Mexico, but moved to her small town because of environmental changes and now the whole population of Monarch butterflies could be in danger of extinction. A lepidopterist comes to study them, and works with and teaches Dellarobia, highlighting her boredom with her husband and her desire for something bigger. Because of her rudimentary education, the reader receives both the scientific explanations for everything and the 'country' version, a cute little metaphor for everything that's happening. This felt a bit insulting to me, as though this setting was chosen to allow for global warming to be explained in a simplified way that the stupid disbelievers could fathom. Prodigal Summer also dealt with the importance of taking care of the environment, but did not make me feel so lectured. 
 Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh, but I'm disappointed to have not enjoyed a book by one of my favorite authors. Her writing is still gorgeous, but the book is massive, slow, and filled with a lot of minutiae about Dellarobia's life I could have done without.

The book's premise starts off promising enough; high school sweethearts meet again at the funeral of a mutual friend some 25 years later and rekindle their romance... a romance it turns out that had never really ebbed. Dawson Cole, one of the main characters, comes from a family of violent lawbreakers and thugs, while Amanda Collier, the other main character, comes from a wealthy, upstanding family. You get the picture: star-crossed lovers whose personal circumstances ultimately short-circuit their relationship. Great stuff, huh, and vintage Sparks! Then the story and plot begin to unravel for me. 
 First of all, there is the ""ghost"" that keeps showing up at critical times in Dawson's life. This metaphysical ""spirit"" gave the story a cheesy quality and I found it hard to take it seriously. I mean after all, this is not a ""Twilight"" novel! Then there were the letters that Tuck (the deceased friend whose funeral caused Dawson and Amanda to be brought back together again) wrote to Dawson and Amanda. The purpose of the letters is made moot because of the book's contrived ending. Why include these letters in the story if they had absolutely no bearing in the book's finale? It doesn't make any sense! 
 Finally, Spark's, once again, has the chance to have one of his novels end well, yet decides, also once again, to end it tragically. Yes, I know that life isn't an endless series of ""happily ever after"" moments...but neither is it an endless series of tragedies either. You'd think Sparks would have learned to mix it up a bit with the endings to his novels, because he is becoming predictable and to me, that means boring. The ending to ""The Best of Me"" was so contrived and predictable, that I already knew what was going to happen when the ""ghost"" led Dawson to the honky tonk bar!

 it's all textured and graphically pleasing and nice to touch and hold: 
 but the story didn't really meet my expectations. 
 i'm giving it a three, but it is a low three. it is an incredibly fast read, and if you are looking for something in that vein - a fast-paced page-turner mystery thing, this may well satisfy you. but be forewarned it is not a creepy book, or even remotely spooky, as the cover and epigraph seem to suggest: 
 In a dark, dark wood there was a dark, dark house; 
 And in the dark, dark house there was a dark, dark room; 
 And in the dark, dark room there was a dark, dark cupboard; 
 And in the dark, dark box there was a....skeleton! 
 which also bothers me because the line that transitions cupboard to box has been omitted, so it looks weird. traditionally, it is : 
 In a dark, dark wood there was a dark, dark house; 
 And in the dark, dark house there was a dark, dark room; 
 And in the dark, dark room there was a dark, dark cupboard; 
 And in the dark, dark cupboard there was a dark, dark shelf; 
 And on the dark, dark shelf there was a dark, dark box; 
 And in the dark, dark box there was a....skeleton! 
 but for all that, it's not supernatural, it's not horror, it's not even psychologically creepy. the characters aren't particularly nuanced, it's predictable, it does that thing that i HATE where years of turmoil could have been avoided with ONE conversation, and amnesia-as-obstacle is so contrived and trite that unless it's handled really really well, it's just distancing; a device used to stretch out the story and lead the reader along by the nose until the author feels like revealing their zinger. which in this case, is telegraphed pretty early on, so it's not quite the rug-yank it's meant to be. 
 but there's a time and a place for every book, right? this was neither my time nor my place, but i can see this being an excellent book to read while on a long train ride, or on a plane, or curled up by a fireplace or a beach, if you're into that sort of thing. it's a very fast read, and despite all my complaints, i really was immersed in it. i just wasn't all that crazy about what i was immersed in. i've just read too much in this genre and this one didn't give me anything i hadn't seen before. but you and i are different people, with different needs. 
 i did have one big chuckle, but i'm not sure it was meant to be funny: 
 I Googled James. Once. Only once. Google was spattered with images of him - pictures of him in costume, onstage, publicity stills, shots of him smiling at charity functions and opening nights. The ones I couldn't bear were the ones in which he was looking directly at the camera, directly out of the screen, at me. When I scrolled down to one where he was naked onstage, in Equus, I had closed the browser with shaking hands, as if I'd stumbled on something violent or obscene. 
 that ""as if"" just cracked me up because - duh - equus.

940,First Sight,Danielle Steel,2013,2013,"NEW YORK TIMESBESTSELLER
Paris, L.A., and the world of ready to wear fashion provide rich backdrops for Danielle Steel's deeply involving story of a gifted designer whose talent and drive have brought her everything--except the ability to erase her past and trust relationships.
FIRST SIGHT 
New York. London. Milan. Paris. Fashion Week in all four cities. A month of endless interviews, parties, and unflagging work and attention to detail at the semiannual ready to wear fashion shows--the famous pret-a-porter. At the center of the storm and avalanche of work is American Timmie O'Neill, whose renowned line, Timmie O, is the embodiment of casual chic, in fashion and for the home. She has created a business that inspires, fills, and consumes her life.
With an unerring instinct for what the next trend will be, an innate genius for business, tireless labor, and sheer fearlessness, starting from nothing, over two decades Timmie has built an international empire that has brought her enormous satisfaction and success. In a world where humility and compassion are all too rare, her humor, kindness, integrity, and creativity are inspirational. Yet as blessed as she feels by her success, Timmie harbors the private wounds of a devastating childhood and past tragedy. She is too smart, too experienced, and too hurt to want much in her personal life beyond a succession of convenient, very limited relationships. Always willing to take risks in business, she never risks her heart.
But despite her well-ordered and highly controlled world, it turns out that Timmie O'Neill is not immune to magic when it strikes. And it strikes in Paris during Paris Fashion Week, when an intriguing Frenchman comes into her life when she gets sick. At first, Timmie and Jean-Charles Vernier are only patient and physician. They become confidants and friends, corresponding at a safe distance between Paris and Los Angeles once she goes home. There is every reason why they must remain apart. But neither can deny their growing friendship and the electricity that sparks whenever they meet.
First Sightis as complex and compelling as modern life itself. Careers, families, histories, losses, duty, obligation, and fear of losing control and getting hurt. It is a tale of daring to take risks, and losing control just enough to have a life, when the opportunity presents itself. When two very different worlds and strong-willed people collide, everything changes in an instant, as they confront the age-old question of whether to lay oneself bare and risk intimacy--or not. Are they brave enough to face what comes next? And will they do it together or apart?",Fiction,Intermediate,5,4,14,9.8,11,3.49,2974,2.0,"Does Danielle Steele get paid by the word? There are so many passages and paragraphs that are redundant (especially in the first half), that I feel like Steele is just milking every extraneous description for the dollars she sees in her head. I could have edited out every other paragraph and this novel would have still made sense and moved faster. 
 This is the first Danielle Steele novel I've ever read, and I can't say I'm impressed. 
 The characters are more mature, but that doesn't make their decisions or actions all that reasonable. I like that Timmie O. is an independent, successful businesswoman but she has literally no friends? What does that say about female business leaders? She's climbed the corporate and fashion ladder but has no one to confide in? She has the confidence to build an empire from nothing but has such low self-esteem that she allows herself to be used by vain pretty boys for months? 
 I understand that she's close to her assistants but even they don't seem well drawn out. Jade is a 32-year old who has never heard of or tried Internet dating? It's 2013! Yet she uses an online grocery delivery service? Huh? 
 And the romance with the doctor was too slow to build and almost unbelievable when it happens. They see each other every day for a week, build a close friendship, don't see each other again for months and then see each other again,where nothing happens. 
 And then just as they say goodbye to one another they feel like they've been struck by Cupid and are suddenly wildly and passionately in love? Because it happens to be Valentines Day? Why is this called First Sight? It should be called 15th sight!",4.0,1,4320,4276.8,0.99,1091,4,2,2
941,Freedom,Jonathan Franzen,2010,2010,"In his first novel since The Corrections, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Walter and Patty Berglund as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.
(from the back cover)",Fiction,Intermediate,19,1,15,8.517241379310345,14,3.73,3971,2.0,"UPDATED. 
 To keep in style of the book this review will be just a lot of rambling. 
 I mean, it was mostly a soap opera. And I just don't do soap operas. I can just about manage about 10 minutes every 5th episode, but that's about it. And Franzen submitted me to 570 bloody pages of a soap opera which I had to digest in a few sittings. 
 Like in all soap operas, everything ends well and love conquers all, of course some characters might have to be killed off along the way, but it seems like a small price to pay for a happy ending, non? 
 If it was well written, then maybe. But how can I take this sort of thing seriously: 
 ""Patty said no, Walter insisted, she insisted no, he insisted yes. Then she realized he didn't have a car and was offering to ride the bus with her, and she insisted no all over again, and he insisted yes"" 
 Sorry, what is this? Is this the Great American Novel? Are you kidding me? 
 ""She almost suggested to Walter that he had better kiss her first, if he was going to be asking her to live with him, but she was so offended that she didn't feel like being kissed at that moment."" 
 And if you are tired of this sugary girly revelations, you can get the more raw stuff when the perspective changes to Katz: 
 ""His dick was saying yes to something now, and this something was certainly not the wideish ass of the retreating jogger. Had death, in fact, been his dick's message in sending him to Washington? Had he simply misunderstood its prophecy?"" 
 You get the idea. 
 And don't even get me started on the fucked up chronology. It wasn't done in eloquent, mysterious way, it was done in a blabbermouth with ADHD way. It is like my friend Maciek, who tells me a story and in the middle of it he remembers some other story that might or might not be related to the story he is telling me so he tells me that other story, and then some other story that somehow came from the second story, and then maybe he will return to the main story and you end up wondering if the second story actually happened in the middle of the first story or it was just his way of telling a story. 
 The final moral from this book is that we are all fucked up in our own special way but it will all be alright unless, of course, we become Republicans, in which case there will be no redemption. 
 It almost killed me. This book almost killed me. But as they say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, therefore this book made stronger, so for that alone I had to give it two stars. 
 I will admit that Patty and Walter were both interesting characters with all the supporting cast being all sorts of caricatures and serving as props to the main duo. 
 Now, I am off to read a book about people who do things and have real problems. 
 *UPDATE - oh yeah. And I also forgot to say that if this book was written by a woman, it would be deemed chick lit and stuck in a pastel colour cover with birds and flowers. No one would even look at it twice because there is so much better chick lit out there. But as Jonathan Franzen is lucky enough to be a man, this, all of a sudden, is the Great American Novel. DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH. 
 If anyone else claims there is no sexism in literary/publishing world, this here is my best demonstrative evidence that there is. Honest to God, who would take this book seriously if it was written by a woman and had something pink on the cover?",71.0,1,860,6871.400000000001,7.99,128,2,3,2

943,The Hours,Michael Cunningham,1999,1999,"In The Hours, Michael Cunningham, who is recognized as ""one of our very best writers"" (Richard Eder, Los Angeles Times), draw inventively on the life and work of Virginia Woolf to tell the story of a group of contemporary characters who are struggling with the conflicting claims of love and inheritance, hope and despair.
The novel opens with an evocation of Woolf's last days before her suicide in 1941, and moves to the stories of two modern American women who are trying to make rewarding lives for themselves in spite of the demands of friends, lovers, and family.
Clarissa Vaughan is a book editor who lives in present-day Greenwich Village; when we meet her, she is buying flowers to display at a party for her friend Richard, and ailing poet who has just won a major literary prize. Laura Brown is a housewife in postwar California who is bringing up her only son and looking for her true life outside of her stifling marriage.
With rare ease and assurance, Cunningham makes the two women's lives converge with Virginia Woolf's in an unexpected and heartbreaking way during the party for Richard. As the novel jump-cuts through the twentieth century, every line resonates with Cunningham's clear, strong, surprising lyrical contemporary voice.
Passionate, profound and deeply moving, The Hoursis Michael Cunningham's most remarkable achievement to date.",Fiction,Intermediate,3,8,12,10.666666666666666,7,3.92,956,3.0,"I hesitated between 3 and 4 stars for this book. It was beautifully written and has a somewhat unexpected (and yet unsurprising) ending. The references to Virginia Woolf are omnipresent as she also comes to life under Cunningham's pen along with Mrs Brown and ""Mrs Dalloway"". Yes, it did relight a flame in me to read the primary Woolf works (Orlando, Mrs Dalloway, To The Lighthouse, The Waves) and reminded me of the one I did read (A Room of One's Own), but still, something about it felt a little superficial. Was it the length (just 220 pages) and the relative ease with which I read it (less than 2 hours)? Or perhaps the heavily laden sentences that perhaps dipped low towards being pretentious? No, I have never seen the movie. And, yes, perhaps I should. But as a standalone novel, I have a hard time understanding why this one was chosen for the Pulitzer in 1997. Not having read either of the runner-ups (Cloudsplitter by Russel Banks about abolitionist John Brown or The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsiolver about the Belgian colonisation of the Congo), both were far longer and of considerably more depth in terms of historical scope from what I can tell. And yet, the Pulitzer committee settled on this short novel (nearly a novella). Well, I am not sure that I would have been in agreement and perhaps need to read the other two finalists to base a more consistent opinion. Regardless, I was not blown away by The Hours, but perhaps will read Flesh and Blood by this author as suggested by another reviewer here on GR.",83.0,1,5400,13500.0,2.5,449,4,2,1
944,The Interestings,Meg Wolitzer,2013,2013,"The Interestings explores the meaning of talent; the nature of envy; the roles of class, art, money, and power; and how all of it can shift and tilt precipitously over the course of a friendship and a life.
The summer that Nixon resigns, six teenagers at a summer camp for the arts become inseparable. Decades later the bond remains powerful, but so much else has changed. In The Interestings, Wolitzer follows these characters from the height of youth through middle age, as their talents, fortunes, and degrees of satisfaction diverge.
The kind of creativity that is rewarded at age fifteen is not always enough to propel someone through life at age thirty; not everyone can sustain, in adulthood, what seemed so special in adolescence. Jules Jacobson, an aspiring comic actress, eventually resigns herself to a more practical occupation and lifestyle. Her friend Jonah, a gifted musician, stops playing the guitar and becomes an engineer. But Ethan and Ash, Jules's now-married best friends, become shockingly successful--true to their initial artistic dreams, with the wealth and access that allow those dreams to keep expanding. The friendships endure and even prosper, but also underscore the differences in their fates, in what their talents have become and the shapes their lives have taken.
Wide in scope, ambitious, and populated by complex characters who come together and apart in a changing New York City, The Interestings explores the meaning of talent; the nature of envy; the roles of class, art, money, and power; and how all of it can shift and tilt precipitously over the course of a friendship and a life.",Fiction,Intermediate,4,11,13,11.75,13,3.54,77741,4.0,"I'm not certain what 44 looks like, other than what I'm presented with in the mirror each morning. The Social Security Life Expectancy calculator informs me that I've lived half my anticipated span. The tired maxim encourages me not to think of the years in my life, but the life in my years. 
 Now that I'm marooned in middle age for a spell, I've been thinking an awful lot about the life in the years ahead of and behind me. Have I achieved something of value in my work, my relationships? Is what I do enough to sustain me intellectually and emotionally for the next forty-four years? Do I measure up to my peers? Am I happy? Am I interesting? This quest for fulfillment and self-actualization is the premise of Meg Wolitzer's sprawling, cracking good novel The Interestings. 
 In the summer of '74, Julie Jacobson, a middle class average achiever from a non-descript upstate New York town, earns a spot at an exclusive arts camp in New England. She is selected to enter the inner circle of the five coolest kids in camp, each a precocious, urbane specimen bred in the hipness of New York City. Julie becomes Jules and we follow her and those five other teenagers for the next thirty years. 
 Jules is obsessed with the self-dubbed The Interestings -the talented and/or privileged people to whom she devotes so much emotional energy. The cult of personalities made me squeamish at times--I wanted her to walk away from the past and create a life of her own. But her devotion to their supposed ideal reveals one of the truths of human nature--we hang onto the golden coming-of-age memories, hoping those few perfect moments of childhood will carry us through the disappointment of growing up. 
 It took me a long time to track on the Jules Vibe. I never quite believed in her intimate friendship with Ash Wolf, the faerie child around whose axis the group of friends spins. Nor did I fully embrace Ethan's constancy of passion for her. She just wasn't, ironically, that interesting. Even her physical presence remained shadowy for me. The others I could picture perfectly--lumbering, awkward Ethan; delicate, perfectly formed Ash; bombshell Cathy; finely etched, beautiful Jonah with his sweep of long, dark hair; golden God turned bloated addict Goodman. But Jules, other than her unruly hair, remained indistinct. 
 Yet, as she matured, growing into her role as friend, counselor, wife and mother, Jules begins to take shape. She became the character I most wanted to get stuck in the middle of a book with. Which is the genius of Wolitzer's narrative--the novel's most enigmatic character becomes its core strength. 
 Not that you'll get stuck in this book. Despite its length and scope, The Interestings impels the reader with sparkling dialogue and description. I did tread water with some lengthy expository and flashback episodes, but it easily becomes one of those books you just can't set down. 
 If you say you don't compare your external successes and failures (e.g. material possessions, presumed income, job, weight, health, marital status, kids' college admissions, job prospects) with your circle of peers, I say ""more power to you."" Forgive me if I don't believe you. Meg Wolitzer probably wouldn't believe you, either. It's what we do, we flawed, insecure, fickle humans. We're hard-wired to want what we ain't got. 
 But we can learn to accept what we've been given. Do The Interestings? Read and find out. 
 I'm five years too young to fall within the brackets of the Baby Boomer generation (cut-off birth year is 1964), and ten years younger than the main characters of The Interestings, but I can relate to many of the novel's cultural reference points and Jules Jacobson's feeling that she just missed out on the badge of cultural honor bestowed those who came of age in the late '60s. 
 I've walked away from traditional success a few times, always choosing the interesting over expected. Perhaps because I fear the fall from lofty heights will be harder to recover from than the soft bounce of relative obscurity. Perhaps I'm just lazy.

What happens to Cujo, how he becomes a horrifying vortex inexorably drawing in all the people around him makes for one of the most heart-stopping novels Stephen King has written.",Fiction,Intermediate,33,1,15,5.529411764705882,6,3.65,162692,3.0,"When a two hundred pound St. Bernard goes rabid, no one is safe! Who will fall to Cujo before the disease he carries finishes him off? 
 I'm just going to come out and say it. Most of this book feels like filler to me. I think King took what was potentially an award winning tale of terror and jammed as much padding into it as he could until it was one of his shorter novels. Basically, it's a fantastic short story wrapped in a soap opera I couldn't give two shits about. 
 That being said, Cujo is a really powerful book in places. While I didn't care about a lot of things on the periphery, the core of it is pretty terrifying and heart-wrenching. No one wants their beloved family pet to turn on them and a rabid dog trapping a woman and her child in a car for DAYS is damn horrifying. As opposed to most of his menaces, Cujo is all too plausible. 
 The writing is good and the ending packs a huge punch. I sure didn't see that coming. It was like being kicked in the balls after you're already lying on the ground after being shot in the heart. 
 While I found that there was a lot of fat on this bone, it was pretty good at the core. Or marrow, in this case. Three hard-earned stars.",91.0,1,2600,7774.000000000001,2.99,26,3,4,2
946,Sycamore Row,John Grisham,2013,2013,"Seth Hubbard is a wealthy man dying of lung cancer. He trusts no one. Before he hangs himself from a sycamore tree, Hubbard leaves a new, handwritten, will. It is an act that drags his adult children, his black maid, and Jake into a conflict as riveting and dramatic as the murder trial that made Brigance one of Ford County's most notorious citizens, just three years earlier.
The second will raises far more questions than it answers. Why would Hubbard leave nearly all of his fortune to his maid? Had chemotherapy and painkillers affected his ability to think clearly? And what does it all have to do with a piece of land once known as Sycamore Row?",Fiction,Intermediate,22,1,13,4.590909090909091,8,3.98,57537,4.0,"Reading the first fifty pages of Sycamore Row I experienced two very different emotions. Firstly, and I can't remember this happening before, I couldn't help but grin as I lost myself in every page, in fact I wasn't aware I was grinning until I heard my mobile ringing and looked away from the book - smiling! The second emotion was anger. Not of Grisham's writing, his narrative or style, but Seth's distant family. Racist, obnoxious, opinionated and just plain vile - you can't help but feel for Lettie the black housekeeper, a housekeeper tasked with looking after the house and an ailing Seth Hubbard for the last three years. Upon his death and his family's arrival Lettie is cast aside like a mess on a shoe, left to fend for her family and unemployed. 
 Now that I've finished Sycamore Row I can categorically say that those emotions never went away. They would bubble and fester, they weren't always present but it was as if they were stuck in limbo, waiting to emerge just like a pocket of air escaping water throughout the entire story. You never quite knew where the bubble would burst but you knew it would at some point. 
 This is without doubt the best legal thriller I've read this year, hands down the best. Set at a terrific pace this multi layered story evolves and evolves and just when you think it can't go anywhere, that the end is in nigh, the book suddenly branches off in a fresh direction, a new perspective, and Grisham introduces a new witness or a different focus to the investigation. This really is clever and sharp witted stuff! 
 Characterisation is key to any book and it was so satisfying for me to find out what happens to Jake Brigance and his family following the trial of Carl Lee Hailey. Three years down the line he's still dining out on the plaudits and fame from the case - even if the money and rewards aren't as forthcoming - and finds himself stuck in a rut doing the same old cases day in day out. Our protagonist had hoped to have moved on to bigger and better things but alas his loss is our literary gain. 
 John Grisham has brought together an eclectic mix of old and new characters. They all play their part in a legal thriller that is both entertaining and evocative. Even the nasty characters are enjoyable; they all help to add depth and colour to the book but Jake, Ozzie and Lucien carry the book as far as I'm concerned. 
 I enjoyed where the book takes the reader and where it ends and hopefully in a few years' time we'll be allowed to revisit Ford County and experience life in Reuben Atlee's courtroom once again through the eyes of Jake Brigance. With sharp dialogue, atmospheric narrative and a sagacious storyline, Sycamore Row is one not to be missed. Highly recommended.",96.0,1,3969,29013.39,7.31,627,3,5,2
947,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,1977,1977,"The Silmarillionis the central stock of J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative writing, a work that he could not publish in his lifetime because it grew with him. Its origins stretch back sixty years, long before The Hobbit,which was independently conceived but was caught up into what he called the ""branching acquisitive theme"" from which emerged The Lord of the Rings.
The Silmarillion,though published last and posthumously, has the primacy, both in terms of the author's life and in terms of its content. It is the story of the First Age in Tolkien's world, the ancient dramas to which characters in The Lord of the Ringslook back, and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part.
The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils; but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. The Silmarillionis the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeleess despite their heroism, against the great Enemy.
The book includes several other shorter works beside The Silmarillionproper. Preceding it are the Ainulindaleor Music of the Ainur, a myth of the Creation, and the Valaquenta,in which the nature and powers of each of the gods are set forth. After The Silmarillionis the Akallabeth,in which is recounted the downfall of the great island kingdom of Numenor at the end of the Second Age; and at the end is the tale Of the Rings of Power,in which the matter of the Lord of the Ringsis treated in the manner The Silmarillion.
The Silmarillionis not a romance, not a fairy tale, not a fictitious history contrived for its own sake. It is a work of unparalleled and sustained imagination, a sombre vision in the mode of myth and legend of the conflict between the desire to dominate the world and other wills and the creative power that proceeds from the development of inherent inner talents. The corruption of Feanor, the creator of supreme beauty, by the deceits of Morgoth and by his own possessive passion for the things of his own making, and the fruits of that corruption, is one of its central themes.
The Silmarillionhas been edited and prepared for publication from many manuscripts by the author's son, Christopher Tolkien.

Where do you even start? There's just so much story in here. Any attempt to convey it in a review would be to do the book a massive disservice. There would only ever be enough space to talk about one or a few elements of the work. 
 So instead I thought I'd give my reasoning as to why every Tolkien enthusiast needs to read this in order to fully understand Tolkien: the sheer depth of the work. 
 ""It is said by the Eldar that in water there lives yet the echo of the Music of the Ainur more than in any substance that is in this Earth; and many of the Children of Iluvatar hearken still unsated to the voices of the Sea, and yet know not for what they listen."" 
 The history of middle-earth is very rich, and it stretches a very long way. Much further than the time of Sauron and the Ring. And this sense of history is only very briefly glimpsed within The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit if at all. The Silmarillion is the entire picture; it is the entire vison of Tolkien's fantasy world. It's a huge piece of world building, and there really is nothing else quite like it. In here he relays a huge amount of history, a truly staggering amount for a fictional world to possess. 
 I often talk about the need for world building in fantasy, and here it is in full force. It's astonishing. It's beyond imaginative. It goes further than anything before it and since. And this is why Tolkien is the master of the genre. He wasn't the first, and he certainly won't be the last to write such fiction, but he was the best writer to ever attempt it. He more than set the benchmark when he wrote this. So if you're thinking about reading this, but find the task at hand a little bit too daunting, then stop thinking. Pick this book and lose yourself in the history of the greatest fantasy universe ever created. You won't regret it.",130.0,1,1292,6447.08,4.99,81,2,5,3
948,The Lowland,Jhumpa Lahiri,2013,2013,"Epic in its canvas and intimate in its portrayal of lives undone and forged anew, The Lowland is a deeply felt novel of family ties that entangle and fray in ways unforeseen and unrevealed, of ties that ineluctably define who we are
From Subhash's earliest memories, at every point, his brother was there. In the suburban streets of Calcutta where they wandered before dusk and in the hyacinth-strewn ponds where they played for hours on end, Udayan was always in his older brother's sight. So close in age, they were inseparable in childhood and yet, as the years pass - as U.S tanks roll into Vietnam and riots sweep across India - their brotherly bond can do nothing to forestall the tragedy that will upend their lives.
Udayan - charismatic and impulsive - finds himself drawn to the Naxalite movement, a rebellion waged to eradicate inequity and poverty. He will give everything, risk all, for what he believes, and in doing so will transform the futures of those dearest to him: his newly married, pregnant wife, his brother and their parents. For all of them, the repercussions of his actions will reverberate across continents and seep through the generations that follow.
Epic in its canvas and intimate in its portrayal of lives undone and forged anew, The Lowland is a deeply felt novel of family ties that entangle and fray in ways unforeseen and unrevealed, of ties that ineluctably define who we are. With all the hallmarks of Jhumpa Lahiri's achingly poignant, exquisitely empathetic story-telling, this is her most devastating work of fiction to date.",Fiction,Intermediate,5,3,12,8.4,10,3.82,63176,5.0,"Wow. Jhumpa Lahiri's THE LOWLAND is a big novel with the power of her best short stories. 
 It follows the life of Subhash Mitra as he grows up in Calcutta and then moves to America--typical fare for Lahiri, but with much broader scope and even cleaner, crisper writing than the Pulitzer Prize winner has shown in the past. 
 With a sweeping, addictive plot, THE LOWLAND still peels naked the identities brother, lover, father, and mother, often with just a small, simple gesture. It challenges the politics of nationality with both pathetic desperation and revolutionary zeal. It makes you want and hope and despair with devastating stories of passion and indifference. 
 I won't write much about the plot because publication's still so far off, plus: spoilers. But when you read it we need to talk: I could write essays on the relationship between the two brother or the sensory magic Lahiri effortlessly conjures in the most simple domestic chores. 
 But simply put: Jhumpa Lahiri might be my favorite living writer, and this is definitely my favorite of her books.",98.0,1,35208,140479.92,3.99,818,5,4,2
949,Firefly Lane,Kristin Hannah,2008,2008,"In the summer of 1974, Kate Mularkey has accepted her place at the bottom of the eighth-grade social food chain. Then, to her amazement, the ""coolest girl in the world"" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all--beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn; Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become TullyandKate. Inseparable.
So begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Laneis the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the mainstay of their lives.
From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success...and loneliness.
All Kate really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her...how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend....
For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship--jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart...and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.
Firefly Laneis for anyone who ever drank Boone's Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it's the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It's about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you--and knows what has the power to hurt you...and heal you. Firefly Laneis a story you'll never forget...one you'll want to pass on to your best friend.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,13,13,13.0,3,4.04,169,5.0,"Fantastic book!

Pursued by Mafia gangsters and playboy millionaires, Holly is a fragile eyeful of tawny hair and turned-up nose, a heart-breaker, a perplexer, a traveller, a tease. She is irrepressibly 'top banana in the shock department', and one of the shining flowers of American fiction.

 For me, some of them are also immortal by the actors who played them, so for example Scarlett O'Hara is always Vivien Leigh, and Holly Golightly can be no one but Audrey Hepburn. 
 Usually this bothers me, the way the movie may influence my reaction to the book, but not with Breakfast at Tiffany's. This story has a different feeling, it's the kind of stories that leaves you to think a lot after finishing it, even though its plot is really not that complicated. 
 I don't think i can say anything new about this book, i am just glad i finally read it. 
 Holly Golightly is a fascinating character, the book seemed to be just a sneak peek into her life during a small moment and after that she was gone again. 
 I liked better the original end of the story, it seemed more realistic than the way they made it in the movie adaptation.

After all, it includes such amazing tales as The Mist and The Jaunt. It must be amazeballs, right? Not so much. Even the epically awesome stories in this collection need to be trimmed down. Most of them start slower than a Lars Von Trier movie, and over half of them never really pay off. There are some serious WTF stories within this collection; stories I didn't understand ten years ago and still do not understand today. In other words, the reread didn't help. That doesn't mean your experience will not be different. It does not mean you will not understand the Milkman stories or appreciate King's cute-ass poem about anthropomorphized fruit that he wrote for his youngest son Owen. I understand why they are in this collection, but that doesn't mean I have to like them. Mostly, this collection is tedious. But, some of the time, if you can wade through the first unmpteen pages of bullshit, you might find a scare or two, or a meaningful story surrounded by bloat. 
 Here are my one-sentence reviews of each story. Feel free to discuss your favorites in the comment section. 
 The Mist - Five epically-awesome stars for this tale of mist-borne monsters and flawed fathers. 
 Here There Be Tygers - Three stars for this story about toileting ""tygers"" and tasty teachers. 
 The Monkey - Two stars for this mostly mediocre, meandering monkey, because this one has never really scared me, but it sure has bored me. 
 Cain Rose Up - Three confused stars because I don't know why this story is still in publication and Rage is not. 
 Mrs. Todd's Shortcut - Four stars for what could be the inspiration for Lisey's Story, because Boo'ya Moon could very well be Mrs. Todd's escape route. 
 The Jaunt - Five stars for this tale that takes cues from The Langoliers. 
 The Wedding Gig - Four stars for this story that fits the Hard Case Crimes series better than both The 
 Colorado Kid and Joyland put together. 
 Paranoid: A Chant - I'm sure this piece is brilliant and I'm just too stupid to understand it, but yeah, one star. 
 The Raft - All the stars (Five, Six... Ten... a Hundred) for what continues to be one of my favorite stories of all time. 
 The Word Processor of the Gods - Gets three stars for being The Monkey's Paw with a happy ending. 
 The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands - Finds three stars because the boys from 249B East 35th are still telling tales, even after Emlyn McCarron told them about The Breathing Method. 
 Beachworld - Beachfront property this ain't, but one helluva four-star story it is. 
 The Reaper's Image - This three-star story seems like the inspiration for that horrible Oculus movie. 
 Nona - Gets four-stars for being darkly dubious. 
 For Owen - If I were King's kid I would expect something better than this two-star cutesy crap from my old man. 
 Survivor Type - While you'll never see Richard Pine on Food Network, his cooking gets five stars. 
 Uncle Otto's Truck - Two stars for this done-to-death concept about a killer car. 
 Morning Deliveries (Milkman #1) - One star for this outline of an idea for a possible short story. 
 Big Wheels: A Tale of the Laundry Game (Milkman #2) - If someone would like to explain this story and its predecessor to me, I might give it more than one star. 
 Gramma - Four-stars for this creepy motherfucker because the beginning is slow as hell, but that ending... *shivers* 
 The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet - This one starts even slower than Gramma but its payoff only raises it into three-star territory. 
 The Reach - Stephen King says he wants to be remembered for this four-star beauty of a story, but he's done much better, at least in my opinion he has. 
 In summation: Skeleton Crew has a few gems, but is, overall, just okay.

953,The Constant Princess,Philippa Gregory,2005,2005,"""I am Catalina, Princess of Spain, daughter of the two greatest monarchs the world has ever known...and I will be Queen of England.""
Thus, bestselling author Philippa Gregory introduces one of her most unforgettable heroines: Katherine of Aragon. Daughter of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain, Katherine has been fated her whole life to marry Prince Arthur of England. When they meet and are married, the match becomes as passionate as it is politically expedient. The young lovers revel in each other's company and plan the England they will make together. But tragically, aged only fifteen, Arthur falls ill and extracts from his sixteen-year-old bride a deathbed promise to marry his brother, Henry; become Queen; and fulfill their dreams and her destiny.
""They tell me nothing but lies here and they think they can break my spirit. I believe what I choose and say nothing. I am not as simple as I seem.""
Widowed and alone in the avaricious world of the Tudor court, Katherine has to sidestep her father-in-law's desire for her and convince him, and an incredulous Europe, that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated, that there is no obstacle to marriage with Henry. For seven years, she endures the treachery of spies, the humiliation of poverty, and intense loneliness and despair while she waits for the inevitable moment when she will step into the role she has prepared for all her life. Then, like her warrior mother, Katherine must take to the battlefield and save England when its old enemies the Scots come over the border and there is no one to stand against them but the new Queen.
""It was my dying husband's hope, my mother's wish, and God's will that I should be Queen of England; and for them and for the country, I will be Queen of England until I die.""
Raised on the battlefield and in the most beautiful Moorish palace in the world, sent to England alone at the age of sixteen to take her place in a court where she couldn't speak the language, and abandoned and forced to endure poverty after the death of her husband, Katherine remained a woman of indomitable spirit, unwavering faith, and extraordinary strength.

 Review at Of Pens and Pages. 
 This group of teenagers infuriated me to no end, Livvy and Ryan the most, but I couldn't stop reading about them. Is this the last book for Amanda Walters and Jordan Tuttle? I think they were the most decent of the bunch, and I was sweet on them and their relationship. 
 Forever follows More Than Friends after Amanda and Tuttle broke up. As Amanda tries to move on, Tuttle realizes he'll do something to make him happy, and that's having her beside him. He has to prove himself that he's 100% sure of what he wants, and will be in this with Amanda. He'll try. 
 Tuttle is as sweet as he was in More than Friends, and even sweeter now since he doesn't want to ruin his second chance with Amanda. He's still hot and raunchy, but ahhhh his affectionate actions made me swoon. I'll definitely cuddle with Tuttle. Such a sweet man. 
 Amanda is still the most logical of the girls, but she gives in to Tuttle too fast. I would have wanted a bit more resistance and some groveling. 
 The angst is focused on Tuttle and Amanda's will they or won't they issue. Will Tuttle finally open up to Amanda? Will Amanda give him chance after chance? 
 If Livvy improved in book two, she pretty much jumped back to how she was in book one. Amanda tried to help her do what's right, but Livvy couldn't be controlled. Girl's gotta do what she wants to do. 
 I'm surprised at how quick I finished this book. I would have wanted to see more of Tuttle's growth since there was a lot of time skips. It made it seem the conflict easily resolved. I believe there are still a few loose ends in the Friends series, so I'm hoping there will be more. This book pretty much breezed by the last few months of their senior year. What happened to Livvy, Dustin, Ryan, Em, and Cannon? How about Kyla? 
 I know Amanda and Tuttle have reached their HFN, but I want to read more about them! I'd read about their college life for sure. A spin-off maybe? But if this is the end of their story, it was a pretty satisfying one for sure. I'm going to miss them! 
 Forever is the third installment in the Friends series, told in Amanda and Tuttle's POVs. It has teenage angst, brooding jocks and smart girls, and a*hole jocks and not-so-wise girls. Such is the life of high school. Full of boys, drama, and everything else in between.

Luminous, haunting, unforgettable, The Age of Miraclesis a stunning fiction debut by a superb new writer, a story about coming of age during extraordinary times, about people going on with their lives in an era of profound uncertainty.
On a seemingly ordinary Saturday in a California suburb, 11-year-old Julia and her family awake to discover, along with the rest of the world, that the rotation of the earth has suddenly begun to slow. The days and nights grow longer and longer, gravity is affected, the environment is thrown into disarray. Yet as she struggles to navigate an ever-shifting landscape, Julia is also coping with the normal disasters of everyday life--the fissures in her parents' marriage, the loss of old friends, the hopeful anguish of first love, the bizarre behavior of her grandfather who, convinced of a government conspiracy, spends his days obsessively cataloging his possessions. As Julia adjusts to the new normal, the slowing inexorably continues.
With spare, graceful prose and the emotional wisdom of a born storyteller, Karen Thompson Walker has created a singular narrator in Julia, a resilient and insightful young girl, and a moving portrait of family life set against the backdrop of an utterly altered world.",Fiction,Intermediate,2,6,10,8.0,1,3.64,61891,5.0,"I loved this book. I read it in one 24 hour period. Great example of soft sci-fi/fabulist fiction. It's like a cross between Alice Sebold's book The Lovely Bones and Lars Van Trier's film Melancholia. In some ways, I also thought about Diary of Anne Frank. A young girl faces a possible apocalypse in MIRACLES. It's YA dystopia but more charming and whimsical than, say, The Hunger Games. Ultimately it is a book that celebrates life with one hand, as it erases life with the other. 
 The language of the book is poetic and intoxicating. The consequences of the slowing earth are imagined in rich and provocative detail. 
 SPOILER ALERT. 
 I did think the author cheated just a bit here and there. It's a brilliant cheat. There are times the hero Julia says things like: ""That was the last time I EVER ate strawberries."" Or I NEVER saw so and so again. That kind of language hints that she might die at the end, or that the world ends in the last chapter. In fact, the character and the world still go on by the novel's end, albeit precariously. I think the more honest phrasing would have been: ""That was the last time I ate strawberries this spring."" Because as long as the earth spins and she is alive, she can't truly know that she will NEVER eat strawberries again. Even if strawberries become extinct, technically she can not know that by some twist of fate she won't eat them again. 
 It's a small thing and I think the author was very clever to use this sleight of hand. It made me think that the girl or the world were going away. It's a book I will think of for some time. As a writer myself of speculative, trippy fiction -- I am in the process of analyzing the many things this book did right!

957,Doctor Sleep,Stephen King,2013,2013,"Stephen King returns to the characters and territory of one of his most popular novels ever, The Shining, in this instantly riveting novel about the now middle-aged Dan Torrance (the boy protagonist of The Shining) and the very special 12-year-old girl he must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals.
On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless - mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky 12-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the ""steam"" that children with the ""shining"" produce when they are slowly tortured to death.
Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant ""shining"" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes ""Doctor Sleep.""
Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan's own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra's soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of hyper-devoted fans of The Shining and wildly satisfy anyone new to the territory of this icon in the King canon.",Fiction,Intermediate,21,1,15,6.857142857142857,8,4.1,98088,4.0,"There is a boy (now a man) a girl, a band of baddies with a charismatic leader, a coalition of the willing, battles to be fought, supernatural elements and magical powers. Stephen King was at this long before Harry Potter lived under the stairs. He has a preternatural (not to say supernatural) talent for writing kids, and can keep you turning pages, losing sleep, and getting back late to work from your lunch breaks. 
 We will presume for the purposes of this review that you have read, or at least seen one version of The Shining. If you have not, read no further, as there are details here that would be considered spoilerish were they to appear in a review of that book. And if you have not read The Shining you should probably do so before taking on Doctor Sleep, a sequel. Ok, everyone here has read The Shining, yes? All right, but we are using the honor system here, and do not want to ruin the fun of reading that one for anyone. So, as long as you're sure... 
 At the end of The Shining, three people survive the carnage, Danny Torrance, a five year old with a special gift, Wendy Torrance, Danny's mother and newly widowed wife of the late Jack Torrance, and Dick Halloran, an employee of The Overlook and possessor of a gift like Danny's, one that allowed him to hear Danny's psychic 911 call and return from his home in Florida in time to do something about it. What happened next? 
 from King's site 
 King does not typically do sequels, if one does not count books that are part of a planned series, but Every now and then somebody would ask, 'Whatever happened to Danny?' I used to joke around and say, 'He married Charlie McGee from Firestarter and they had these amazing kids!' But I did sort of wonder about it. - (from EW)One of the central features of The Shining was Jack's Torrance's battle with alcoholism. As with the real world, King's fictional realm notes that alcoholism runs in families. And one of the criticisms of The Shining was that the possibility of Jack considering getting some help from AA is never even raised. If King has ever considered that to have been an oversight, I have not seen that interview. But it is clear that he has given the matter some thought. Jack Torrance never tries Alcoholics Anonymous. That is never even mentioned in ""The Shining."" He has what they call white-knuckle sobriety. He's doing it all by himself. So, I wondered what it would be like to see Danny first as an alcoholic, and then see him in AA. (from an NPR Interview)It gives nothing away to let you know that Danny is a true Torrance. Not only does he self-medicate to quiet the terrors that still haunt him, he is far from the best person he can be.I knew if I did this sequel I'd have to try to put together some of the same elements, but at the same time I didn't want to make it too similar. I didn't want to make Danny a grown up with kids of his own, and try to replicate that whole losing-your-temper-because-you're-drunk thing. But I did think to myself: 'Not only alcoholism can be a family disease, but rage can be a family disease.' You find that the guys who abuse their children were abused themselves as kids. That certainly fit Danny as I knew him. - from EW 
 All SK novels require a baddie, or a set of them. No disappointment here. King has again succeeded in taking the ordinary and making it horrifying.Driving back and forth from Maine to Florida, which I do twice a year, I'm always seeing all these recreational vehicles -- the bounders in the Winnebagos. I always think to myself, 'Who is in those things?' You pass them a thousand times at rest stops. They're always the ones wearing the shirts that say 'God Does Not Deduct From a Lifespan Time Spent Fishing.' They're always lined up at the McDonald's, slowing the whole line down. And I always thought to myself, 'There's something really sinister about those people because they're so unobtrusive, yet so pervasive.' I just wanted to use that. It would be the perfect way to travel around America and be unobtrusive if you were really some sort of awful creature. - from EW 
 This wandering band call themselves The True Knot. They feed on the essence of those gifted with the sort of talent people like Danny possess. It provides them with extraordinary longevity, but as with their Transylvanian counterparts, the need is ongoing and the supply is limited. Like right-wing politicians they are more than happy to gorge on the pain of others and are shown here feasting on the spirits set adrift on 9/11. The usual condiments for this substance they call steam will not do. The taste and benefit is enhanced, however, if their victims endure extreme and prolonged torture. Does Ted Cruz drive a Winnebago? King gives the members Damon Runyon-esque names, like Crow Daddy, Steamboat Steve and Tommy the Truck. 
 By the time you finish reading Doctor Sleep you might have a new image of the top hat to consider next time you are planning a formal night out. We all have one, probably this one: 
 But the baddie in Stephen King's latest is likely to do for the top hat what this guy 
 did for the derby. Rose O'Hara, the leader of a group called The True Knot, won't leave home without it. It adds a nice visual element, calling to mind a certain Caribbean Baron, and making Rosie even more riveting. 
 And what of our young heroine? Abra is born with a shining of prodigious proportions. (btw, the name Abra was inspired by Abra Bacon, a character in East of Eden) She manages to send out a signal even when she is newly arrived. She's a good kid, despite scaring her parents on occasion with tricks like making all the silverware in the kitchen take to the air, or causing the odd earthquake when she does a mental Bruce (or if you prefer, David) Banner. Don't make her angry. You wouldn't like her when she's angry. Bad-ass teen girl power fuh shoo-uh. But, just as Danny needed Dick Hallorann and Tony, Abra needs help as well. That she and Danny will team up is a foregone conclusion. 
 As for Danny, the shining never left him, despite his attempts to wipe it out with spirits of a different sort. But he finds the help he needs and manages to put his talent to good use. He works in a hospice, the Helen Rivington House, in Frazier, NH, easing the transition for those near death, with the assistance of a resident feline, and earning himself the name Doctor Sleep, which also serves to remind us of what his parents called him....It is this moment of transition that Doctor Sleep deals with and the idea, like so many of King's, came from an incidental story in a newspaper. This one was about ""a cat in a hospice that knows when people are going to die. He would go into that patient's room and curl up next to them. And I thought, that's a good advertisement for death, for the emissary of death. I thought, 'I can make Dan the human equivalent of that cat, and call him Doctor Sleep.' There was the book."" - from an interview in The Guardian 
 King has a bit of fun, naming the cat Azzie, short for Azreel, the archangel of death. Cute. 
 What else do you need, really? Dark vs light, colorful baddies vs our everyman and everygirl. And that is indeed enough. But it is not all that King uses. He gives us a look at how people can really help people overcome, or at least handle their problems. When asked, in the NPR interview, whether his AA depictions were from personal experience, King says that the second part of AA stands for Anonymous, so he declined to offer a yes or no, however You could say, having read these two books and knowing that I was a very heavy drinker at the time that I wrote ""The Shining,"" and I haven't had a drink in about 25 years now - you could draw certain conclusions from that...I've done a lot of personal research in these subjects. - from NPR interview 
 AA figures very large in this story, is central really. And the wisdom one can find in AA permeates the novel, from the importance of recognizing that we need help from others, to accepting our past and dealing with it, a very strong, serious element. 
 King sets the time of the events by referring to external realities, like who the president is, calls on contemporary cultural references, such as a mention of the Sons of Anarchy and a Hank Wiliams Jr song. He also mentions a variety of other writers in his travels, some approvingly, (John Sandford, George Seferis, Bernard Malamud, Bill Wilson) some not so much (the authors of the Twilight and Hunger Games series, and Dean Koontz and Lisa Gardner, although he may merely be playing with the latter two). He also drops in an Easter egg reference to Salem's Lot and make two references (that I caught anyway) to his son, Joe's, imagined world from Joe's book, NOS4A2. 
 It has been my experience with reading Stephen King that his conclusions sometimes offer a poor partner to the journey one takes in reaching them. That is much less the case here. The ending is not an alien spider disguised as Tim Curry with bad fashion sense or alien young playing with humans in a ham-fisted manner. And the journey is indeed fun. But I had some gripes. King gives Dick Hallorann a cameo here, which was fine, and the strongest of those. Tony returns for a look-see but goes alarmingly quiet at crucial moments. We could have used a lot more about Tony other than the weak explanation that is offered near the end. If the True Knot are so bad-ass, how come there are so few of them? There is an explanation offered of prey-predator stability of numbers, but I found that unpersuasive. And why the hell introduce Jack if he is not going to be a part of the action? This is one that actively irked. 
 Sequels present a danger. One of the things that is stimulating about any book, any story is newness. That is why most sequels are not as popular as their predecessors. It is hard to avoid a been-there-done-that problem when working atop existing material. The next story in line is unlikely to retain the sparkle, the shine of what went before. Given the constraints, Doctor Sleep fares better than most as a follow-on. There is enough distance in the story from the events of the past, and little enough overlap with those characters that the story seems fresh. When events from The Shining are mentioned, they do inform the current action and do not distract much. In fact there could have been more of that. So, in that way, this is a very nice addition. There is another element involved. Any event, any activity, is a product of the thing itself and of the perspective from which we view or participate in it. I read The Shining many years ago. I was an adult then, in my late twenties, and remember it as a VERY SCARY story. I have not come across much in horror lit that is still scary in that way, in the several decades since. I will not have any nights (on in my case days) of lost sleep because of the images King has proferred. But then, I am getting on, and am looking at those scary things with aging eyes. Someone younger (which would be almost all of you reading this) might find them far more frightening than I did. 
 So while Doctor Sleep might not cause much by way of lost rest, it is good, mainstream Stephen King and thus, hardly a snooze. The Doctor of Horror is in. Wake up!

958,White Teeth,Zadie Smith,2000,2001,"On New Year's morning, 1975, Archie Jones sits in his car on a London road and waits for the exhaust fumes to fill his Cavalier Musketeer station wagon. Archie--working-class, ordinary, a failed marriage under his belt--is calling it quits, the deciding factor being the flip of a 20-pence coin. When the owner of a nearby halal butcher shop (annoyed that Archie's car is blocking his delivery area) comes out and bangs on the window, he gives Archie another chance at life and sets in motion this richly imagined, uproariously funny novel.
Epic and intimate, hilarious and poignant, White Teethis the story of two North London families--one headed by Archie, the other by Archie's best friend, a Muslim Bengali named Samad Iqbal. Pals since they served together in World War II, Archie and Samad are a decidedly unlikely pair. Plodding Archie is typical in every way until he marries Clara, a beautiful, toothless Jamaican woman half his age, and the couple have a daughter named Irie (the Jamaican word for ""no problem""). Samad --devoutly Muslim, hopelessly ""foreign""-- weds the feisty and always suspicious Alsana in a prearranged union. They have twin sons named Millat and Magid, one a pot-smoking punk-cum-militant Muslim and the other an insufferable science nerd. The riotous and tortured histories of the Joneses and the Iqbals are fundamentally intertwined, capturing an empire's worth of cultural identity, history, and hope.
Zadie Smith's dazzling first novel plays out its bounding, vibrant course in a Jamaican hair salon in North London, an Indian restaurant in Leicester Square, an Irish poolroom turned immigrant cafe, a liberal public school, a sleek science institute. A winning debut in every respect, White Teethmarks the arrival of a wondrously talented writer who takes on the big themes --faith, race, gender, history, and culture-- and triumphs.",Fiction,Intermediate,3,14,16,15.0,5,3.75,84311,4.0,"The more I think about this book, the more I marvel at what Zadie Smith was able to create through it. I seriously almost didn't make it through this read, and it is only in the looking back that I see just how brilliant it is. Smith starts with two characters, then links character after character to them. 
 It all starts with two men lost in WWI, having no real role in it, and discover it has ended without their knowledge. They capture a war architect after the war and invent stories in some attempt to claim true manhood. There is so much story in between. Two twin brothers, one who is sent back to the Middle East in hopes of retaining the Muslim ways. The other fully engaged in all things secular. 
 Smith does a lot of meandering, but in the end, what do a fundamentalist Muslim, a Jehovah's Witness, and ardent animal rights activists have in common? Sounds like a joke, but as it turns out, quite a lot. 
 A few things this book had me thinking about. 
 -How science and religion have become polarized. 
 -How different one generation is from the next, and how this impacts both. 
 -Many things are not at all what we expect. 
 -What defines manhood. 
 -How black and white thinking is so dangerous. 
 -How one action leads to unforeseen others, and all of life seems connected. 
 My only real problem with this read was the length of the meandering narratives.",54.0,1,4563,4517.37,0.99,524,4,1,3
959,The Silkworm,Robert Galbraith,2014,2015,"Private investigator Cormoran Strike returns in a new mystery from Robert Galbraith, author of the #1 international bestseller The Cuckoo's Calling.
When novelist Owen Quine goes missing, his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike. At first, Mrs. Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few days--as he has done before--and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home.
But as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine's disappearance than his wife realizes. The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous pen-portraits of almost everyone he knows. If the novel were to be published, it would ruin lives--meaning that there are a lot of people who might want him silenced.
When Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike any Strike has encountered before...
A compulsively readable crime novel with twists at every turn, THE SILKWORM is the second in the highly acclaimed series featuring Cormoran Strike and his determined young assistant, Robin Ellacott.",Fiction,Intermediate,10,2,13,7.1,8,4.04,231,5.0,"4.5 stars

One day Cujo chases a rabbit into a bolt-hole - a cave inhabited by sick bats. What happens to Cujo, how he becomes a horrifying vortex inexorably drawing in all the people around him makes for one of the most heart-stopping novels Stephen King has written.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,8,15,5.529411764705882,4,3.65,162692,3.0,"When a two hundred pound St. Bernard goes rabid, no one is safe! Who will fall to Cujo before the disease he carries finishes him off? 
 I'm just going to come out and say it. Most of this book feels like filler to me. I think King took what was potentially an award winning tale of terror and jammed as much padding into it as he could until it was one of his shorter novels. Basically, it's a fantastic short story wrapped in a soap opera I couldn't give two shits about. 
 That being said, Cujo is a really powerful book in places. While I didn't care about a lot of things on the periphery, the core of it is pretty terrifying and heart-wrenching. No one wants their beloved family pet to turn on them and a rabid dog trapping a woman and her child in a car for DAYS is damn horrifying. As opposed to most of his menaces, Cujo is all too plausible. 
 The writing is good and the ending packs a huge punch. I sure didn't see that coming. It was like being kicked in the balls after you're already lying on the ground after being shot in the heart. 
 While I found that there was a lot of fat on this bone, it was pretty good at the core. Or marrow, in this case. Three hard-earned stars.",91.0,1,2600,7774.000000000001,2.99,26,3,3,2

Madeleine has not spoken since that awful day and she keeps getting flashbacks of that day and a few days before it. 
 Wow. This is quite a difficult subject to read. The first few chapters are quite hard going. The author manages to maintain the tension and pace throughout the book, though it is a bit slow to start. There are twists and turns to keep your interest and an ending I never saw coming. This is a lovely written book. Once you start it you will find it hard to put down. I devoured this book in a day. Highly recommend.

 ********** 
 A seemingly unending stream of word vomit. 
 I can think of no other way to describe this thing. 
 I really, really despised almost everything about The Corrections. I finished it solely so that I could write a horrible review and have it be valid. 
 At no single point before the last 10 pages of this 566-page monster did I feel a shred of sympathy with any of the characters. There were several moments where I thought Franzen would have been better off writing dialogue-for-the-average-Joe instead of the trumped up and out of place Dawson's Creek-esque vocabulary in almost every human interaction. His insistence on using the ""25-cent word"" at every turn made reading the story choppy at best... aggravating and unenjoyable. 
 I also couldn't help but see the author in a lot of his characters' worst personality traits. Annoying hipster-lecher I'm-better-than-capitalism-but-still-depend-on-it Chip. Whiny too-good-for-anyone Gary. Ungrateful I'm-a-bitch-but-require-all-your-love-and-attention Denise. The parents? Alfred is the only one for whom I felt any sympathy and that didn't happen until the last dregs of the book... and I think maybe even then it was a knee-jerk reaction at being so close to the book being over. Enid's issues rubbed me the wrong way for many reasons, not the least of which being that I could see my own mother in her... which means, I suppose, that Enid was probably the most well-represented character in the novel. 
 The secondary characters were almost entirely a sorry lot with personalities to the extreme in any number of directions - too smart, too stupid, too needy, too plain, too EVERYTHING. 
 I know that I'll never understand the praise this book received from critics and readers... and I'm ok with that. I do wish, however, that I could meet some of the people who relate it so easily to real life. Meeting them, perhaps, would truly terrify me.",278.0,1,825,816.75,0.99,135,2,4,2

966,Firefly Lane,Kristin Hannah,2008,2008,"In the summer of 1974, Kate Mularkey has accepted her place at the bottom of the eighth-grade social food chain. Then, to her amazement, the ""coolest girl in the world"" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all--beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn; Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become TullyandKate. Inseparable.
So begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Laneis the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the mainstay of their lives.
From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success...and loneliness.
All Kate really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her...how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend....
For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship--jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart...and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.
Firefly Laneis for anyone who ever drank Boone's Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it's the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It's about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you--and knows what has the power to hurt you...and heal you. Firefly Laneis a story you'll never forget...one you'll want to pass on to your best friend.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,13,13,13.0,3,4.04,169,4.0,"Firefly Lane is the story of Kate and Tully.

Tully left the foster home and returned to the area where she'd met Kate. After learning of Tully's grandmother's death, Kate's parents invited Tully to live with them if she was willing to follow the house rules and Tully did. The rest of the story followed Kate and Tully through adulthood and the challenges they faced. 
 Firefly Lane has changed my perception of how I view people I know who has faced the same challenges as Tully and how abuse warps the mind.

Now the government wants its brainchild back - for its own insane ends.",Fiction,Intermediate,35,1,15,4.542857142857143,2,3.85,145067,4.0,"When some cash-poor college students volunteer for an experiment, they have no idea of the Pandora's Box they are about to unleash. Years later, one of them, Andy McGee, is on the run from The Shop, with his daughter, Charlie. Can Andy and Charlie evade The Shop before their world goes up in flames? 
 First off, for years now, I cannot read the title without hearing the Prodigy song of the same name. Maybe he'll follow this one up with a book called Fuel my Fire or Smack My Bitch Up one of these days to continue along the same lines. 
 Firestarter is one of those Stephen King books you don't hear all that much about. A lot of people only know of it because of the movie starring Drew Barrymore in the 1980s. Well, more people should know about it because it's a corking good read. 
 A 1960s experiment gave Andy McGee and his wife psychic powers. It also altered their DNA enough to produce Charlie, their immensely powerful psychic daughter, whose abilities include pyrokinesis, hence the title. 
 For a good portion of the book, the suspense comes from Andy trying to stay one step ahead of The Shop. The rest of it is the two McGees trying to escape The Shop's clutches. The Shop, and John Rainbird, make fantastic villains because they aren't nearly as far outside the realm of possibility as evil cars and spider-clowns. 
 Like a lot of Stephen King books, the relationships between the characters keep the story going. John Rainbird proved to be more than the scene-chewing villain I originally pegged him as. Unlike the protagonists in Doctor Sleep, I feared for Charlie and Andy almost constantly. 
 I'd forgotten how brutal King was sometimes in his older books. There are some parts of this one I'll remember for a long time. Maybe Stephen King will revisit a character or two from this book before he goes to the clearing at the end of the path, maybe as part of a Dark Tower story. 
 As I said before, this is a very underrated King book. I don't really have anything bad to say about it. Four out of five stars.",90.0,1,740,2952.6000000000004,3.99,152,2,5,2

969,Empire Falls,Richard Russo,2001,2002,"Richard Russo--from his first novel, Mohawk, to his most recent, Straight Man--has demonstrated a peerless affinity for the human tragicomedy, and with this stunning new novel he extends even further his claims on the small-town, blue-collar heart of the country.
Dexter County, Maine, and specifically the town of Empire Falls, has seen better days, and for decades, in fact, only a succession from bad to worse. One by one, its logging and textile enterprises have gone belly-up, and the once vast holdings of the Whiting clan (presided over by the last scion's widow) now mostly amount to decrepit real estate. The working classes, meanwhile, continue to eke out whatever meager promise isn't already boarded up.
Miles Roby gazes over this ruined kingdom from the Empire Grill, an opportunity of his youth that has become the albatross of his daily and future life. Called back from college and set to work by family obligations--his mother ailing, his father a loose cannon--Miles never left home again. Even so, his own obligations are manifold: a pending divorce; a troubled younger brother; and, not least, a peculiar partnership in the failing grill with none other than Mrs. Whiting. All of these, though, are offset by his daughter, Tick, whom he guides gently and proudly through the tribulations of adolescence.
A decent man encircled by history and dreams, by echoing churches and abandoned mills, by the comforts and feuds provided by lifelong friends and neighbors, Miles is also a patient, knowing guide to the rich, hardscrabble nature of Empire Falls: fathers and sons and daughters, living and dead, rich and poor alike. Shot through with the mysteries of generations and the shattering visitations of the nation at large, it is a social novel of panoramic ambition, yet at the same time achingly personal. In the end, Empire Falls reveals our worst and best instincts, both our most appalling nightmares and our simplest hopes, with all the vision, grace and humanity of truly epic storytelling.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,14,14,14.0,12,3.91,91773,5.0,"The small Maine town of Empire Falls has seen better days. The local and once booming timber and textile industries have run their course and all that remains is the abandoned and decrepit real estate of what once was. 
 The blue collar workers of this small New England community struggle to find the few jobs remaining that allow them to keep the wolf at the door and food on the table, ever hopeful of revitalized opportunities. 
 And it is here that we meet Miles Roby, manager of The Empire Grill. Miles is a good and decent man who did not always dream of flipping burgers and taking care of the grill, in fact at one time he had promising opportunities slated for his future. But then life, as it is wont to do, bit back and he answered an urgent call to return home from college and help care for his ailing Mother. 
 The vast majority of the real estate and by extension the job opportunities in Empire Falls are owned and controlled by the Whiting family or to be more precise, Francine Whiting. 
 This really is not a plot driven novel. The real bounty here lay in the character development of the residents of Empire Falls that we largely come to know through Miles Roby. And oh my word, what a treasure trove of characters they are. So real and flawed, everyday folk, fleshed out so well by Russo's pen that you may find yourself recognizing a few of them within your own circle of associates, friends and family. Seriously I am so astounded by the raw talent on display here. These people walk, talk and breathe, stagger and stink all over these pages. And such a wide cast of people, each saddled with their own histories, beliefs, resentments, weaknesses, dreams and strengths and real life struggles. I feel like I know them all intimately. 
 When you get to know people that well, for better or worse, you care about what happens to them. And there is a lot going on here. Miles is on the cusp of a divorce and his ex's future husband loves to hang about and taunt him. His brother is a recovering addict and Miles just can't be sure he won't fall off the wagon. Then there is his teenage daughter Tick who is spreading her own wings while coping with the ruins of her parents marriage. His employer, the stoic Francine, maintains a strange hold over Miles and his father is the most colourful, odiferous vagrant you are ever likely to meet. And so many more. 
 What Russo has accomplished here in Empire Falls is nothing short of masterful. It is a social novel on a grand scale that reflects real life issues with all the inherent joys and sorrows, beauty and blisters. This is epic storytelling that will extend its gracious arms in welcome and bruise your battered, hopeful heart.",109.0,1,5292,15823.080000000002,2.99,458,4,1,1

",Fiction,Intermediate,16,1,14,4.375,15,3.8,2024,5.0,"Prefatory Matters: I lost a twenty-year-old book during this reread. Most of you have the seen the picture of my gutted hardcover copy of Insomnia. If you haven't I'll include it at the end of this post as well. Total loss of containment, folks. About thirty pages loosed themselves from the glue and became individual souls. I have a 284 page section, and another section of about 400 pages, and a little bit in the middle that just said ""Fuck it"" and struck out for the territories. All in all, a sad day. Luckily, I have another one. Same edition. Same year. All's good. Oh, and a quick warning to owners of first edition Insomnias, the glue the printing press used back in 1994 is faulty. This separation is a common problem with this edition of the book. Keep your copy on a shelf. Do not touch. This has been a public service announcement brought to you in part by the letter E. 
 Actual Review: Insomnia is a difficult book to review without spoilers. Hell, the publisher didn't even know what to do with the cover of this one so they just put King's name on the front along with the title in alternating red and white. It's even a difficult novel to categorize. I guess it's horror. Maybe it's speculative fiction... or perhaps lit fic... or maybe bizarro... Fuck if I know, dude. I will say this much, it's a fun ride. 
 The only problem with this book is the requirement that you must have read the Dark Tower series to fully understand some of the plot. I mean, you can get through it without such knowledge, but it's a bit confusing in places if you don't have said knowledge. Roland Deschain is mentioned three times in this book. I tried to look at these sections as an outsider, as someone who has not read the DT books even though I have (numerous times), and I feel comfortable saying that the sections which mention Roland and the Tower would make zero sense to someone who is new to the King-verse. There is no context, nothing to draw off of. In fact, there is a paragraph toward the end of the book that says: ""Worlds which had trembled in their orbits now steadied, and in one of those worlds, in a desert that was the apotheosis of all deserts, a man named Roland turned over in his bedroll and slept easily once again beneath the alien constellations."" Imagine, if you will, that you've never read a Dark Tower novel (or, shit, maybe you haven't) and you just happened to pick up Insomnia because your buddy said, ""Yo, kid, peep this thick-ass book. Looks legit good, right? I mean, who the fuck doesn't love 800 pages cloaked in a sexy-as-fuck red and white jacket!?!?!?!?"" If you're that ""kid"", that Roland fucker means absolutely nothing to you. It seems pointless. Sad panda. 
 But for me? Son, I live for that shit. I love the DT references, all of them. I dig that shit in my heart of hearts. I'm the asshole in the coffee shop that won't shut up with the ""Yeah, but did you catch this bit?"" comments. I know, I know, I hate me too, but it's the truth. As far as I am aware there is no other author who has created a vaster universe, one that crosses every genre line in the business. King has written it all, and everything he writes puzzle-pieces back together in some way. Dig it, man. Or, you know, don't dig it. But I'm still going to nerd out whenever I stumble across the Beam. 
 Yes, this book is a little longwinded in spots, but what King book isn't? (Dolores Claiborne) Yes, it references the Dark Tower, but what King novel doesn't? (Mr. Mercedes ... seriously, so far it's the only novel of his that doesn't reference Mid-World in some way.) But it's also one of his most imaginative stories. I kinda feel that Insomnia is an 800-page wink-and-nod to the King-verse fans out there. Shit, dudettes, even the shoe Gage loses in Pet Semetery is in this book, not to mention entire ass-loads of It, Derry, and Pennywise references. Does all this bog down the story? No. Are there going to be parts you don't understand if you haven't read Roland's quest or trip-trapped through the story of The Loser's Club? Yes. Does any of this detract from the fun of this book? Nope. Not in the least. There is a well-plotted, expertly-honed story under all the referencing and fan service. This is King doing what King does best. Entertaining the people who bought tickets to see him in concert. 
 I will be skipping my normal Hidden Gems and Obvious Tie-Ins sections because I'm saving them for my A Decade with King: 1985-1994 post, which will be out April 1, 2015. There's a lot this time around, and I don't wanna type it twice. But I will leave you with this food for thought: 
 Spoilers for several King books. Click ""view spoiler"" at your own risk: Are the likes of Abra Stone and Dan Torrance and Johnny Smith on the same level of the tower that Ralph and Lois visit in Insomnia? Does Danny help people die in Doctor Sleep by allowing their aura to pass into him? (I just got goosebumps. You didn't need to know that, but that's how hard I fanboy.) 
 In summation: A King novel for King fans. I don't suggest anyone start with Insomnia, but I recommend it to all fans of the Dark Tower series and It. A mashup of everything fans love and hate about King rolled up in a Derry burrito and seasoned with Mid-World.

971,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,Seth Grahame-Smith,2010,2012,"Indiana, 1818. Moonlight falls through the dense woods that surround a one-room cabin, where a nine-year-old Abraham Lincoln kneels at his suffering mother's bedside. She's been stricken with something the old-timers call ""Milk Sickness.""
""My baby boy..."" she whispers before dying.
Only later will the grieving Abe learn that his mother's fatal affliction was actually the work of a vampire.
When the truth becomes known to young Lincoln, he writes in his journal, ""henceforth my life shall be one of rigorous study and devotion. I shall become a master of mind and body. And this mastery shall have but one purpose..."" Gifted with his legendary height, strength, and skill with an ax, Abe sets out on a path of vengeance that will lead him all the way to the White House.
While Abraham Lincoln is widely lauded for saving a Union and freeing millions of slaves, his valiant fight against the forces of the undead has remained in the shadows for hundreds of years. That is, until Seth Grahame-Smith stumbled upon The Secret Journal of Abraham Lincoln, and became the first living person to lay eyes on it in more than 140 years.
Using the journal as his guide and writing in the grand biographical style of Doris Kearns Goodwin and David McCullough, Seth has reconstructed the truelife story of our greatest president for the first time-all while revealing the hidden history behind the Civil War and uncovering the role vampires played in the birth, growth, and near-death of our nation.",Fiction,Intermediate,7,4,15,8.0,6,3.7,1643,5.0,"""Without death,"" he answered, ""life is meaningless. It is a story that can never be told. A song that can never be sung. For how would one finish it?"" 
 Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is an impeccable example of how history can be made interesting with strategy. Even though I'm vastly interested in history, reading huge textbooks or listening to commentaries still makes me sleepy. I've read about how Lincoln died many times now, from different sources, but I never understood why it happened. I also never really knew much about him other than he was a former U.S President. I'm sure that if I grew up in the U.S then I would have vast knowledge of him, but sadly I didn't. I heard that this book was heavily researched on, so I'm guessing I now have at least a brief introduction on who Lincoln was as a President. Events were obviously coated with the vampire-fantasy gimmick, but I still see some as real events that happened. 
 Before reading this I already knew I was going to enjoy it. The premise was straightforward and it caught my interest immediately. Despite numerous 1-2 star reviews, I went ahead and decided to read this book anyway. Such a great decision I made. 
 The writing was near perfect. The way that the author alternated from his narration and Lincoln's journal was very interesting. If it was an attempt to maintain the reader's interest, then he clearly succeeded, at least with me. I'm clearly happy with the historical vibe of the novel, and the way that it didn't venture out of it. Some other authors would mistakenly write about things that are not present in the time that they're trying to portray. I didn't see anything wrong with SG-S' writing, so I'm clearly satisfied. 
 The plot was in parr with the premise. It showed Lincoln's life, as a vampire hunter. A parody but life lessons were still present. That's the great thing about reading fiction, not only does it interest you, but it also teaches. If I were to quote all of the things I thought were life lessons then this review wouldn't be a review, but rather a short preview. All you need to know is that it was really amazing. Here's one of my favorites though: 
 """"Judge us not equally, Abraham, We may all deserve hell, but some of us deserve it sooner than others."" 
 The characters were all interesting and genuine. Genuine in a way that they weren't pretentious. The author also didn't make them seem unbelievable. Another reason why I like the writing of this novel. Also the way that Abe developed was really good. It was very well incorporated to the vampire aspect of the novel. No cheesy vampire romance here. The vampires are violent and merciless. I would also like it mention that the author was rather harsh with the outcome of some characters. I'm not sure if they really happened, but the harshness managed to interest me too. I don't have a faint heart, and the darker the novel the better, for me. 
 I can't wait the read the sequel of this. I heard though that it can be read as a standalone, considering it's Henry's point of view, and that makes me even more excited. I really liked Henry here, so reading about the what he decides to do after Abraham's death is clearly exciting. I'm glad the author made a sequel about him. 
 5/5 stars. This is my first read of Seth Grahame-Smith, and clearly it's not going to be my last. He managed to exceed my expectations. I don't give out 5 stars that often, but this novel clearly deserves it. Highly recommended. Will probably read this again in the future.",65.0,1,348,344.52,0.99,291,1,3,3

Drawn together by their shared love of literature and the loss of their respective spouses, the Major and Mrs. Ali soon find their friendship blossoming into something more.

 Major Pettigrew is a 67 year old English widower who is trying to navigate the growing changes in the world, the dearth of discipline, the turning tide of etiquette, the lack of loyalties.

He becomes as dear to the reader as a beloved, yet eccentric uncle would. 
 Mrs. Ali is a kind, generous Pakistani widow who owns and runs the small convenience store down the street from Major Pettigrew. As she struggles to maintain her individuality as a worthwhile woman while adhering to the pressures of her fundamentalist Muslim family, she finds a friend and soul mate in the kind, quiet man of Mr. Pettigrew.

Finally, we get to meet the star of the show - a/k/a the smartest pooch ever grown in a lab. No offense el doggito, but there can only be one Einstein . . .

Paris, L.A., and the world of ready to wear fashion provide rich backdrops for Danielle Steel's deeply involving story of a gifted designer whose talent and drive have brought her everything--except the ability to erase her past and trust relationships.
FIRST SIGHT 
New York. London. Milan. Paris. Fashion Week in all four cities. A month of endless interviews, parties, and unflagging work and attention to detail at the semiannual ready to wear fashion shows--the famous pret-a-porter. At the center of the storm and avalanche of work is American Timmie O'Neill, whose renowned line, Timmie O, is the embodiment of casual chic, in fashion and for the home. She has created a business that inspires, fills, and consumes her life.
With an unerring instinct for what the next trend will be, an innate genius for business, tireless labor, and sheer fearlessness, starting from nothing, over two decades Timmie has built an international empire that has brought her enormous satisfaction and success. In a world where humility and compassion are all too rare, her humor, kindness, integrity, and creativity are inspirational. Yet as blessed as she feels by her success, Timmie harbors the private wounds of a devastating childhood and past tragedy. She is too smart, too experienced, and too hurt to want much in her personal life beyond a succession of convenient, very limited relationships. Always willing to take risks in business, she never risks her heart.
But despite her well-ordered and highly controlled world, it turns out that Timmie O'Neill is not immune to magic when it strikes. And it strikes in Paris during Paris Fashion Week, when an intriguing Frenchman comes into her life when she gets sick. At first, Timmie and Jean-Charles Vernier are only patient and physician. They become confidants and friends, corresponding at a safe distance between Paris and Los Angeles once she goes home. There is every reason why they must remain apart. But neither can deny their growing friendship and the electricity that sparks whenever they meet.
First Sightis as complex and compelling as modern life itself. Careers, families, histories, losses, duty, obligation, and fear of losing control and getting hurt. It is a tale of daring to take risks, and losing control just enough to have a life, when the opportunity presents itself. When two very different worlds and strong-willed people collide, everything changes in an instant, as they confront the age-old question of whether to lay oneself bare and risk intimacy--or not.

There are so many passages and paragraphs that are redundant (especially in the first half), that I feel like Steele is just milking every extraneous description for the dollars she sees in her head. I could have edited out every other paragraph and this novel would have still made sense and moved faster. 
 This is the first Danielle Steele novel I've ever read, and I can't say I'm impressed. 
 The characters are more mature, but that doesn't make their decisions or actions all that reasonable. I like that Timmie O. is an independent, successful businesswoman but she has literally no friends? What does that say about female business leaders? She's climbed the corporate and fashion ladder but has no one to confide in? She has the confidence to build an empire from nothing but has such low self-esteem that she allows herself to be used by vain pretty boys for months? 
 I understand that she's close to her assistants but even they don't seem well drawn out. Jade is a 32-year old who has never heard of or tried Internet dating? It's 2013! Yet she uses an online grocery delivery service? Huh? 
 And the romance with the doctor was too slow to build and almost unbelievable when it happens. They see each other every day for a week, build a close friendship, don't see each other again for months and then see each other again,where nothing happens.

 Although there was a good romance in this book, it wasn't the main focus of the book. Instead, this novel put most of it's emphasis on family and friendship and I really liked that! Sadie definitely got on my nerves a lot, mostly because I was listening to this as an audio book and the narrator made her voice especially annoying while saying her lines. However, she had a surprising amount of character development keeping in mind that she was the GHOST of a 105 year old woman. I really enjoyed how this was a mystery as well, there was so much going on that you almost forgot about one part of the story when it showed up again! The one critique I have, though, is how long this book was. I felt like there were too many dead ends while trying to find that one necklace and it was starting to get a little repetitive. I think it could have wrapped up a little quicker, but it still was a fun read!",156.0,1,415,2070.85,4.99,251,3,2,1
978,The Bluest Eye,Toni Morrison,2000,2005,"The Bluest Eyeis Toni Morrison's first novel, a book heralded for its richness of language and boldness of vision. Set in the author's girlhood hometown of Lorain, Ohio, it tells the story of black, eleven-year-old Pecola Breedlove. Pecola prays for her eyes to turn blue so that she will be as beautiful and beloved as all the blond, blue-eyed children in America. In the autumn of 1941, the year the marigolds in the Breedloves' garden do not bloom. Pecola's life does change- in painful, devastating ways.
What its vivid evocation of the fear and loneliness at the heart of a child's yearning, and the tragedy of its fulfillment. The Bluest Eyeremains one of Tony Morrisons's most powerful, unforgettable novels- and a significant work of American fiction.",Fiction,Intermediate,11,3,13,7.818181818181818,11,3.99,111515,5.0,"...his mother did not like him to play with niggers. She had explained to him the difference between colored people and niggers. They were easily identifiable. Colored people were neat and quiet; niggers were dirty and loud...The line between colored and nigger was not always clear; subtle and telltale signs threatened to erode it, and the watch had to be constant. 
 While I was not the biggest fan of Morrison's style in this novel, I did fully appreciate the dagger-sharp insight that she brought to the color caste system that is so prevalent in African-American culture, even today. Her dialogue rang so true, I could hear it coming directly out of my mother's mouth, my grandmother's mouth, and those of all of the women who've ever filled our kitchens with raucous communal fun and glum communal tragedy alike. Her use of the Dick & Jane children's books, used for decades to teach children to read (SEEMOTHERMOTHERISVERYNICEMOTHERWILLYOUPLAYWITHJANEMOTHERLAUGHSLAUGHMOTHERLAUGHLA) created a chilling, ironic and staggering contrast between the lives of the whites and those of the blacks in this novel. Shirley Temple, Mary Jane candies, and Jean Harlow hairstyles - you'll find the delicacy of all of them here, both in these characters' reality and in metaphor. While the truth and injustices here were often sobering to read, they were filled with too much truth to rightfully deny or turn away from. 
 I could spend hours discussing this novel. I could quote from it all day, but I won't do that, because the entire read was poignant and so crisply aware of the color line - the how and the why - that there is no one point that can overshadow another in the message that these words aimed to send. This novel is older than I am, and yet it still rings with such verity, with such biting truth and reality. With The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison cut open the existence of both internalized and externalized racism in America and laid it bare and exposed at our feet. For that, she deserves nothing but reverence and applause, so she will always have that from me. 
 Anyone who's ever been in doubt of a color line in Black America should read this book. Anyone who's ever questioned, ""But why can't I say those words when you say them all the time? But why do you still believe that racism exists? Why can't you just get over it - the past is the past?"" should read this book.

Every chapter introduces new narrative techniques, new perspectives and characters, and new voices. This is a book that definitely requires some homework to fully appreciate. I would recommend the aforementioned Gilbert Stuart commentary and biography, the Frank Budgen criticism, and especially the classic Richard Ellman biography. There is precious little here not to love regardless of your literary tastes, but like most good things, this book asks you to work for it. As Leopold Bloom goes through this day in Dublin, all kinds of things are happening all around him and it is a virtual reality experience in four dimensions - ending with for me one of the most beautiful chapters ever written, the stream of conscious dialog of Bloom's wife posing as Ulysses' Penelope. It is of such texture and voluptuousness that it is impossible to capture without first hand experience of having read it.

980,Dreamcatcher,Stephen King,2001,2002,"What might be done to human beings by the ""Other""--whether the ""Other"" be vampires, demons or creatures from outer space--is always in competition for absolute horror with what we do to ourselves. Stephen King has, in his time, played with both sources of the nightmarish and in Dreamcatcher, the first complete novel since his near-fatal accident, he gives us both.
Four childhood friends, united by secrets, are caught in the quarantine zone when something crashes into the remote forests of Maine; and the question becomes who will avoid being eaten alive by alien fungi, torn from the inside by alien ferrets, possessed by alien minds or menaced by a psychotic military commander to whom ruthlessness has become a macho ego trip?
The Earth is in peril as well, needless to say, but most of our attention is taken up with a few men caught on the edge, and where the most important thing in the world turns out to be the fact that four small boys saved a fifth from a beating.
This has the hall-marks of a good King novel--memorable catchphrases whose meaning we only gradually learn and a sense of how it feels to be human. --Roz Kaveney",Fiction,Intermediate,15,1,15,5.2,10,3.59,522,3.0,"As I was going up the stair 
 I meet a man who wasn't there; 
 He wasn't there again today! 
 I wish, I wish he'd stay away. 
 Well, what a ride that was... 
 Rating this book was quite hard. I'm still not sure if I'm okay with giving it 3 stars, because it had so many good characters, parts and plot twists, so one part of me feels like giving it 5 stars. But then again, at some parts, it left me feeling miserable and asking myself if I was ever going to finish it, so because of that, the other part of me think that it deserves only 2 stars. So I guess I'll just have to settle and give it 3 (3.3) stars. But still, I don't think I've ever wished that Goodreads had a half-star system, as much as I do now. 
 Dreamcatcher is a book about alien invasion, but it's unlike any other alien invasion book. Also, it is unlike any other Stephen King's book that I've read. The book started out great. I actually loved the first half. I loved getting to know our main characters, I loved the plot, and I loved how King introduced aliens. There were even some scenes that creeped me out, and at some parts I even had to stop reading for a few seconds. But then, somewhere in the middle, something happened, and the book unfortunately got worse. It started dragging on and at some parts it became flat out boring. Then, maybe 50 pages before the end, the pace picked up again, and it got back to being amazing. I absolutely loved the way it ended, and how everything came together. 
 When it comes to characters, just like in any other King's work, they were my favorite part of this book (well, at least some of them were). I loved our main four characters (Henry and Jonesy especially). I also loved Duddits, and even Owen. But, on the other hand, there is Kurtz - a character I absolutely despised. And he is the main reason why I had problems with this book. I think that his character was completely unnecessary. I loved reading from everyone's point of view except from his. And the irony was that his chapters got bigger and bigger as the book went on. In my opinion, he brought nothing to the story, and was only there to make it longer. If his character was removed from the story I don't think that anything important in the plot would change. 
 In the end, even though this book made me question my sanity a few times, I'm still glad that I've read it. Even though it had some bad parts, it also had so many more amazing parts.",54.0,1,316,1576.84,4.99,310,1,5,1

He's had these hunches since he had an ice-skating accident as a child. Now he has an ability to see into the future. An ability which will bring him into a terrifying confrontation with a charismatic, power-hungry and dangerous man...",Fiction,Intermediate,32,1,14,7.75,4,3.9,1135,4.0,"Johnny Smith is one bad-luck bastard. 
 He starts off well enough as a nice guy with a talent for teaching and is in the early stages of what looks to be a very promising relationship with Sarah. However, a car accident leaves Johnny in a coma which nobody thinks he'll recover from. Miraculously, he wakes up 4 years later, but he finds that Sarah has married someone else, his mother has turned into a religious lunatic, he's got a long and painful rehab to endure, and he faces a mountain of debt from his hospital bills. Oh, and he now has psychic ability to learn details about a person by touching them or personal objects as well as sometimes seeing their futures. This might seem like a gift, but as Johnny quickly learns it's really a curse that eventually puts him on a collision course with a dangerous politician named Greg Stillson. 
 I've always thought this was one of King's better books but hadn't read it for years. A new audio version with James Franco narrating and doing a pretty good job of it got me motivated, and I'm pleased to find that it mostly lives up to my memory of it. 
 The elephant in the room on this one is that even though it was published in 1979 the Stillson plot is about a populist demagogue who manages to rise in politics despite being a crazy and corrupt piece of shit just because he has talent for making rubes think that he's a maverick who tells it like it is even as they willfully ignore the obvious warning signs. So it'd be easy to say that King is a prophet these days. Yeah, he hit the mark with that one, but on the other hand there's plenty of writers who have done stories about shady politicians. 
 What I found more interesting here is what King did with Johnny's mother, Vera. She starts out as someone with strong fundamental religious beliefs, but Johnny's accident sends her over the high side and into the realm where she starts believing tabloid stories about Jesus living underground at the South Pole. She's completely immune to facts and logic, and she'd rather rely on prayer than medication to handle her high blood pressure. 
 It's fascinating to read a character like this in the '70s setting where tabloids and poorly printed tracts are how Vera gets her crackpot theories, and how even then she uses them to create her own view of the world because reality doesn't suit her. Fast forward to the 21st century where some people pick their news web sites based on how it conforms to what they want to believe as they spread rumors on Facebook about child sex rings in the basement of pizza restaurants that don't even have a basement, and you realize that King had tapped into something that was on the rise even then. 
 Leaving aside the eerie similarities to America today, what sets this apart from his other novels is the way that King focused on John Smith and made his story a genuine tragedy. Johnny just wanting to try and resume some kind of normal life, but unable to stop himself from using his power to help people and put himself in a media spotlight is incredibly compelling. 
 Uncle Stevie takes his sweet time with this so that it comes across as more a slow burn, and it's not really a horror novel although it can be creepy at times. You can see where the bigger plot involving Johnny and Stillson is headed for a good long while although King still makes the journey there worth the trip, and Johnny is one of his characters who haunts me the most.",99.0,1,760,1512.4,1.99,148,2,4,3

 Om det ar nagot Mo Hayder kan sa ar det att skriva bocker som gar under skinnet pa en. Precis som Dennis Lehane sa vagar hon ta ut svangarna och det ar med isande fasa man laser varje sida. 
 Forsvunnen ar inget undantag. Att lasa om kidnappade barn ar hemskt och man vet inte om Jack Caffery kommer att lyckas radda situationen. Caffery ar en lysande polis, men i denna bok sa verkar det som om kidnapparen kan forutse polisen nasta drag och ju mer tiden gar desto mer lutar det at att det ar forsent, att flickan inte kommer att raddas. 
 Sedan har vi polisdykaren Flea Marley, som lever med konsekvenserna fran foregaende bok, vilket stor henne i jobbet. Hon vet inte om att Jack misstanker henne for ett brott som hon faktiskt ar oskyldig till men som i och med det Jack vet om det ter sig logiskt att han misstanker henne. Nu ger hon sig in kampen for att radda den kidnappade flickan. Men ar hon verkligen i form att ta sig an fallet? Kommer hon istallet bara att riskera sitt eget liv?

 ENGLISH REVIEW 
 If there is one thing Mo Hayder knows is it to write a book that crawls under your skin. She dares, just like Dennis Lehane can she write in such a way that it's with terror you turn each page. 
 Gone is no exception. Reading about kidnapped children is always terrible and you do not know if Jack Caffery will be able to save the kidnapped girl. Caffery is a brilliant police, but in this book, the kidnapper seems to anticipate every single move the police do, and as more time goes by, the fear grows that they will be too late. 
 Then we have police diver Flea Marley, who lives with the consequences from the previous book, which has consequences for her at work. She does not know that Jack suspects her for a crime she's actually innocent of. Although it's quite logical that he suspects her since he doesn't have the whole picture. Now she decides to search for the kidnapped girl. But, is she really in shape to help out? Or will she only risk her own life? 
 Gone is a tough thriller where the unidentified perpetrator always lurks in the background, and at the end, when Caffery confronts the perpetrator will you still question if everything will end happily...

984,The Rosie Effect,Graeme Simsion,2015,2014,"Don Tillman and Rosie Jarman are back. If you were swept away by Graeme Simsion's international smash hit The Rosie Project, you will love The Rosie Effect.
The Wife Project is complete, and Don and Rosie are happily married and living in New York. But they're about to face a new challenge.
Rosie is pregnant.
Don sets about learning the protocols of becoming a father, but his unusual research style gets him into trouble with the law. Fortunately his best friend Gene is on hand to offer advice: he's left Claudia and moved in with Don and Rosie.
As Don tries to schedule time for pregnancy research, getting Gene and Claudia back together, servicing the industrial refrigeration unit that occupies half his apartment, helping Dave the Baseball Fan save his business and staying on the right side of Lydia the social worker, he almost misses the biggest problem of all: he might lose Rosie when she needs him most.

In turn that made me think perhaps this sequel was less enjoyable than the original, but the more I think about it, the more convinced I am that this book is just as good if not better than The Rosie Project. I was just taken for a loop because this book seemed so much more ""real"" than the first, and real life is hard and awkward and rage inducing. 
 Its possible that I was being too hard on Rosie, I think it is just so much easier to relate to Don, or at least to like Don because he is so transparent. However after closing the book and thinking on it I confirmed my suspicion that Rosie wasn't being a bitch, she was just being herself in a hard situation. 
 While still filled with laugh out loud moments like the original, The Rosie Effect is noticeably more dark, and I have to respect the author for going in this direction. It was a risky move but I think it paid off. I am definitely interested in another installment of the Don and Rosie show.

985,Needful Things,Stephen King,1991,1992,"Leland Gaunt opens a new shop in Castle Rock called Needful Things. Anyone who enters his store finds the object of his or her lifelong dreams and desires: a prized baseball card, a healing amulet. In addition to a token payment, Gaunt requests that each person perform a little ""deed,"" usually a seemingly innocent prank played on someone else from town. These practical jokes cascade out of control and soon the entire town is doing battle with itself. Only Sheriff Alan Pangborn suspects that Gaunt is behind the population's increasingly violent behavior.",Fiction,Intermediate,20,2,14,4.2,5,3.88,155887,5.0,"Mr. King likes to tell stories about people getting trapped. He's got one about a guy trapped in a bedroom. He's got a whole bunch of these stories, really. He's got people trapped inside a car, in a gas station, a classroom, a grocery store, a hotel, on an island, a city under a giant force field. I'm pretty sure he's got one about a lady handcuffed to a bed for the whole book. I'm just going from memory here. He's probably got a lot more. 
 In Needful Things, the entire town of Castle Rock is trapped by their possessions. Its citizens are punished mercilessly for 700+ pages with some special brand of evil that feeds off the sin of imbuing bric-a-brac with sentimental value. 
 Admittedly, I'm oversimplifying the plot of this book quite a bit. But Needful Things is just a morality tale at its core, a boldfaced warning about materialism. The message of the book seems to boil down to something we all heard as kids, mom saying that you don't need those roller skates, you just want them. 
 But to say that this is only a simple morality tale really does this book a disservice. It's got all the things I like in a King book: suspense, action, gore, folksy humor (the cruel and the crude varieties), characters you can identify with, protagonists you care about, insane people and perverts, monsters and great big explosions. Most importantly, it's got a great villain. Our bad guy, Leland Gaunt, isn't subtle, he chews up the scenery at every turn, but he's exactly what this novel calls for. Done well (and King does them very well), comic book villains are the best kind. All right, maybe just the most fun to read about. 
 And, yes, this book had some of the Stephen King things I don't like so much. I feel sometimes King is writing down to his characters, like he'll create a character just for the sake of mockery. Lester Pratt, the goody two-shoes, Christian 'boy scout' character in this book is a prime example. I would be willing to bet that no one ever--no matter how repressed and/or brainwashed, sheltered, or close-minded--ever, ever had an internal monologue that's featured the celebratory phrase ""rooty toot toot"" repeatedly while thinking about the prospect of getting some pussy. 
 King also has a tendency to veer into some rather cloying, almost treacly, Garrison Keillor territory, and in this book the opening and closing are perhaps the most nauseating examples of this that I've personally encountered. 
 And then, like with many of King's novels, we have the borderline deus ex machina ending. 
 Now, I know what you're thinking: 
 Wow, it seemed like there for a minute you were saying you like Stephen King. But now it seems like you're being rather hard on the guy. 
 But, you see, the thing is, Stephen King is sort of like the President of the United States of America. (Bear with me here.) The people you hear bitching about the President the most, the people who are the hardest on him, seem to always be the very same people who voted him into office. I've read over thirty books by Stephen King. So, in my mind, that pretty much means I voted that son-of-a-bitch into office over thirty fucking times! 
 I'll say what I want. 
 And now you're probably asking, would you vote for that son-of-a-bitch again?

 The heroine of this book ate Chicken Marsala in two different restaurants, twice for takeout, at a wedding, at a dinner with her friends and cooked it 4 times with different levels of success. I don't know if there's anything more boring than a person who never tries anything new (if I'd been the hero, I'd have stopped dating her just because of this.) 
 I enjoyed the first part of the book - the humor was not over the top and the plot was wacky but not creepy. Then as the book progressed, I found two of my big pet peeves: adults that don't confront their parents when they're out of line and the demonizing of men. You see, I had a mother like Min's so I totally understand what it is to live with constant criticism regarding my figure. But when I was in my 20s, I had a very firm chat with my Mom about it and told her I wouldn't tolerate that behavior. Did my Mother stop completely? Of course not, but at least now it's manageable and not humiliating like it used to be. And that's why I cannot respect Min who at 33-years old, should not let her mother choose her hairdo, her clothes or the food she eats. 
 I HATED how Cal was demonized because he dated a lot. He was so nice and thoughtful that women fell in love with him in droves and when he realized they were more serious than him, he would break up with them. The bastard! Doesn't he know that once a woman falls in love with him, he owes her a ring no matter his feelings? He made them fall in love! It's his fault! Because you know, women are little girls that cannot take responsibility for their own feelings and must get every man they want. **Throwing up now** 
 Then the ending was so saccharine, I don't think I'll eat anything sweet for a month. 
 The narration was good but I don't think that Cal's voice was distinctive enough. But what makes this narration really irritating is the author's writing style. Almost every line of dialogue ends in 'he said' or 'she said' so after a while, I wanted to shoot myself. I had to speed up this book a lot, just to see if I could stop hearing 'so and so said' after every sentence. 
 Because I liked the humor, I was thinking that I should give this author another shot, but then I thought that for the first time ever, an author has put me off food. If nothing else, that's my clue that I should never read anything by this author again. She's liable to make me swear off bread or chocolate and THAT I couldn't stand.",120.0,1,106,846.94,7.99,1266,1,3,2

 Although there was a good romance in this book, it wasn't the main focus of the book. Instead, this novel put most of it's emphasis on family and friendship and I really liked that! Sadie definitely got on my nerves a lot, mostly because I was listening to this as an audio book and the narrator made her voice especially annoying while saying her lines. However, she had a surprising amount of character development keeping in mind that she was the GHOST of a 105 year old woman. I really enjoyed how this was a mystery as well, there was so much going on that you almost forgot about one part of the story when it showed up again! The one critique I have, though, is how long this book was. I felt like there were too many dead ends while trying to find that one necklace and it was starting to get a little repetitive.

When they are both called back to their hometown for the funeral of the mentor who once gave them shelter, they will be forced to confront the choices each has made, and ask whether love can truly rewrite the past.",Fiction,Intermediate,17,1,15,7.294117647058823,12,3.9,105839,2.0,"This was probably the most disappointing Nicholas Sparks book I have ever read. The book's premise starts off promising enough; high school sweethearts meet again at the funeral of a mutual friend some 25 years later and rekindle their romance... a romance it turns out that had never really ebbed. Dawson Cole, one of the main characters, comes from a family of violent lawbreakers and thugs, while Amanda Collier, the other main character, comes from a wealthy, upstanding family. You get the picture: star-crossed lovers whose personal circumstances ultimately short-circuit their relationship. Great stuff, huh, and vintage Sparks! Then the story and plot begin to unravel for me. 
 First of all, there is the ""ghost"" that keeps showing up at critical times in Dawson's life. This metaphysical ""spirit"" gave the story a cheesy quality and I found it hard to take it seriously. I mean after all, this is not a ""Twilight"" novel! Then there were the letters that Tuck (the deceased friend whose funeral caused Dawson and Amanda to be brought back together again) wrote to Dawson and Amanda. The purpose of the letters is made moot because of the book's contrived ending. Why include these letters in the story if they had absolutely no bearing in the book's finale? It doesn't make any sense! 
 Finally, Spark's, once again, has the chance to have one of his novels end well, yet decides, also once again, to end it tragically. Yes, I know that life isn't an endless series of ""happily ever after"" moments...but neither is it an endless series of tragedies either. You'd think Sparks would have learned to mix it up a bit with the endings to his novels, because he is becoming predictable and to me, that means boring. The ending to ""The Best of Me"" was so contrived and predictable, that I already knew what was going to happen when the ""ghost"" led Dawson to the honky tonk bar!

In her absence he falls hopelessly in love with Helen, a young widow, and his life is transformed by the experience. With a duty to repay his debts and an inability to distinguish between love, pity, and responsibilty to others and to God, Scobie moves inexorably to his final damnation.
The terrifying description of a man's awe of the Church and the ability to portray human motive and to convey such a depth of suffering make The Heart of the Matterone of Graham Greene's most enduring, tragic novels.",Fiction,Intermediate,16,3,16,7.875,6,3.98,19450,4.0,"Four stars, because of the quality of the writing. But I am going to disagree with the label that goes with it, that of ""really liked it."" Because I did not. I feel no affection for this book, and I doubt that I will ever re-read it for many reasons that I will state below. But for those just reading this to get a quick glance about whether they should read it or not: you should, in short. It is worth it. I just would not expect to fall in love. 
 The book focuses on Major Scobie, a policeman in a British colony of West Africa, where Greene himself spent some time. It's set during WWII, which serves to set up the mood of distrust, fragility and vague apprehension that is to haunt the novel and our hero. Major Scobie is a Catholic, and he is married to a shallow, mild horror of a woman named Louise. Insert her unhappiness, his distance, another woman, another man, and you have your novel right there. Those are the basics. Okay, now I can move forward with this. 
 The book is essentially a character study of Major Scobie. And in that function, it is incredibly thorough, and makes sure to search into every area of his soul, several times over. We really do see the man laid naked in front of us. Which is appropriate, given that he's meant to be Christ figure (and casts himself in that role several times.). Even one of the priests says that ""when people have a problem they go to you, not to me,"" and bemoans the fact that priests are not as useful as policemen. It's an interesting thought, but in any case. To me, he was an embodiment of abstract Catholic virtues, set out in one man, going about life as the Catholic Church would have you do. This made real sense to me for the first part of the novel, where Scobie is deconstructed very well, and Greene's conceit was quite effective, I thought. He shows us the difference between living your life as a man and living your life as an abstract virtue. Scobie stays untouched by the animal side of humans, the love, the anger, all vice ridden emotions found in the world that are not learned, but come from within. We do not see him exhibit any of these emotions. And honestly, you sort of dislike him for it. He is inhuman, which drives his wife and everyone who knows him crazy, and honestly, it drove me a little crazy too. But. I appreciated it as a message about living in the world rather than living apart from it, untouched by it. Scobie's major motivation is pity and compassion, which is exactly what Catholicism would tell you to do. But it seems so distant, so resigned, that its rather awful. You end in pitying Scobie as much as you do the clearly inferior characters around him. Or at least, I did. Graham Greene peppers this study with a great many insightful observations about death and the attachment that we really have for people, and what love really is. 
 **spoiler alert*** 
 Which builds into the second half of the novel, which annoyed the flying fuck out of me, confused me and I'm really not sure if I agree with the premise of it at all. Essentially, Greene has Scobie become involved in an affair with a shipwrecked widow named Helen, who has absolutely no one. It's an incredibly sordid affair like one would expect to see in a soap opera, and Scobie is meant to seem all wrong for the role. He has Scobie motivated by pity for her, has him express that it is the weak, the ugly who demand his allegiance, not the beautiful and the intelligent. So this is what makes him succumb to Helen. And then on top of that, he says that he stays with her out of pity. That it was love in the beginning (which I don't believe, as they never show it at all, but skip forward to the part where he is lamenting how love is over) and then it is about duty and responsibility and keeping her happy because if he left, then she would be in pain, and he doesn't want to cause anybody pain. And then his wife comes back, and everyone tells her about the affair, and then she's in pain. And he can't leave either of them because they need him more than God does. That's a direct quote from him. Which is how he squares it with his sinning conscience, carrying on with the whole thing. And then he kills himself because people who love you forget you the second you die, and then nobody will be in pain anymore, and so he's sacrificing himself for them. I just cannot agree with the whole premise and excuse that Scobie makes for his conduct there. I don't believe he ever knew what love was, I don't believe in his reasoning for why he would have succumbed to Helen in all noble motivations. As a Catholic and a girl who's done it before herself, I can certainly see why you would be attracted to someone out of pity. Why you would feel love for people who need you. Fine. But there were many other ways to help Helen other than screwing her, sir. I don't buy that such a distant guy would have ""fallen in love"" due to pity. I buy that he stays with his wife out of pity and responsibility. I don't buy the whole affair, so I can't believe in his moral dilemma. Helen is painted as such an awful whore character I cannot believe why he would have been there at all. (We'll get to that in a second.) Then he goes screaming to God over and over again. I get the penchant for drama. I'm Catholic. Yes, it was interesting to try to see a man live exactly as the Church would tell him, and still to be a human being. But I don't buy that it happened to Scobie. I just hate the whole sordid interlude. I know I'm supposed to hate that its so sordid. But I just think that he made Scobie a much less interesting character throughout it, and everyone else involved were mere representations of what he needed to progress along his moral dilemma, not real people. 
 But. Given that. The last few chapters where he methodically plans his suicide, tries to save everyone the pain around him, quietly goes about his business, and the meditation on what it is like to know that you are leaving the world... that was good. That was heartbreaking. It was that effective quiet whisper of endless pain that I just thought was incredibly skillful and well done. 
 Okay, I really need to talk about what really offended me in this book though: the terrible misogyny. The characters in this book are horrific. There is an extremely strong Madonna/whore complex that runs throughout it, and is represented by the cardboard cutouts that are Louise and Helen. These women are represented exactly as a man who knew nothing about women but what he read in books would represent them as. Grasping, shallow, bitter, angry, small, but with amazing flashes of insight that awe men!.. and yet they are so childish at the same time, so fragile!.. and then they are so stupid the next second. I hated all the women in this book, and I'm pretty sure Graham Greene did, too. I hated that Louise and Helen weren't women, weren't people, but were mere representations of his moral dilemmas, one dimensional harpies who enacted him scenes, had emotional fits, and generally made his life a living hell. Poor baby man who only wanted peace, but no no, these screeching women just insist upon ruining his life! Women are the root of all evil. If it weren't for them, Scobie would be a perfect Christ angel! No wonder Greene converted to Catholicism, if this was his opinion of women. The Church agrees wholeheartedly. Women must be madonnas who look after your home, to be worshipped, who look after your spiritual well being, and stick by their men when they are unfaithful- i.e: Louise. Or they are lost souls who are ready to fuck the first man who comes by when their hero does not support them- like Helen. They have no inner strength of their own except in those first meetings that drew our hero to them, before they became harpies, like all the rest of women are! The two girls were virtually indistinguishable in their manner sometimes. Maybe that's why I just couldn't get into Scobie's dilemma. The women involved made me want to barf, and his bad taste in them, and his opinions of them as people just revolted me just as much. 
 End opinion: Graham Greene's writing: good, elegant, with quiet insight. Graham Greene's misogyny: godawful.",39.0,1,4104,24582.96,5.99,603,4,4,2

While many hold up ""Catcher in the Rye"" as the zenith of his achievements for me it will always be this wistful and brave little book. I re-read it two or three times or year. I love it that much. 
 To be honest out of the nine stories collected here I would say that only a third are Salinger's best. ""Perfect Day for Banafish,"" ""For Esme - With Love and Squalor,"" and ""The Laughing Man"" are to me the peaks of short fiction. Everything that Salinger does best he does in these three tales. Nobody wrote children better than him. They leap off the page at you right into your lap. Esme, her brother, Seymour's little friend and the narrator of ""Laughing Man"" are so vivid and real you feel like running them all down the street for ice cream and cake. They are that true to life. 
 Same goes for Seymour in ""Banana Fish"" and the narrator of ""For Esme."" Nobody got into the heads of brilliant but troubled young people better than Salinger. What we hear about Seymour as opposed to what we see creates a palpable (and beautiful)tension. The narrator of ""For Esme""'s war inflicted emotional problems are drawn with such artistry as to flood over you as you read. 
 ""Uncle Wiggly in Connecticut,"" ""Daumier-Smith's Blue Period,"" and ""War with the Eskimos"" to me fall into the ""damn entertaining but not great"" category. These stories are beautifully observed, funny, poignant and always a pleasure to read but lack that magic the first three have to spare. Of course that being said even being good but not great Salinger makes them better than most. 
 Finally ""Teddy,"" ""Down in the Dinghy"" and ""Pretty Mouth Green My Eyes"" are good stories but I feel they suffer from being collected in the same book as the others. Each alone is enthralling but not a one of them is a patch on ""Esme,"" or ""Bananafish."" Where the other stories feel like a full meal these come off more like snacks. Tasty but not quite filling.

Colored people were neat and quiet; niggers were dirty and loud...The line between colored and nigger was not always clear; subtle and telltale signs threatened to erode it, and the watch had to be constant. 
 While I was not the biggest fan of Morrison's style in this novel, I did fully appreciate the dagger-sharp insight that she brought to the color caste system that is so prevalent in African-American culture, even today. Her dialogue rang so true, I could hear it coming directly out of my mother's mouth, my grandmother's mouth, and those of all of the women who've ever filled our kitchens with raucous communal fun and glum communal tragedy alike. Her use of the Dick & Jane children's books, used for decades to teach children to read (SEEMOTHERMOTHERISVERYNICEMOTHERWILLYOUPLAYWITHJANEMOTHERLAUGHSLAUGHMOTHERLAUGHLA) created a chilling, ironic and staggering contrast between the lives of the whites and those of the blacks in this novel. Shirley Temple, Mary Jane candies, and Jean Harlow hairstyles - you'll find the delicacy of all of them here, both in these characters' reality and in metaphor. While the truth and injustices here were often sobering to read, they were filled with too much truth to rightfully deny or turn away from. 
 I could spend hours discussing this novel. I could quote from it all day, but I won't do that, because the entire read was poignant and so crisply aware of the color line - the how and the why - that there is no one point that can overshadow another in the message that these words aimed to send. This novel is older than I am, and yet it still rings with such verity, with such biting truth and reality. With The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison cut open the existence of both internalized and externalized racism in America and laid it bare and exposed at our feet. For that, she deserves nothing but reverence and applause, so she will always have that from me. 
 Anyone who's ever been in doubt of a color line in Black America should read this book. Anyone who's ever questioned, ""But why can't I say those words when you say them all the time? But why do you still believe that racism exists? Why can't you just get over it - the past is the past?"" should read this book.

Having recently moved back to his hometown (and back into his overindulgent mother's house), he gets an IT security job at the local paper. His job involves reading through flagged email and sending out warnings to anyone in the office who breaks company rules regarding internet use. When he starts getting flagged emails between Beth and Jennifer, he knows he should send them a warning and move on, but he can't seem to bring himself to do it. Before he knows it, he's read so many of their conversations that he feels like a total creep, but he still can't bring himself to stop. It's when he begins to fall for Beth, however, that Lincoln's torture truly begins. 
 Told from a third-person perspective with Lincoln at center stage, we only get to know Beth and Jennifer through their emails to each other. While this is often a difficult method for an author to use to truly portray a character (especially since people only project a certain amount of themselves to others, especially through emails), Rainbow Rowell managed to really make it work. I felt like I really got to know Beth and Jennifer through their emails, and for the first time in too long, I can actually understand why the male protagonist fell in love with the female. Beth and Jennifer are genuinely good people, devoted friends, and beautifully flawed individuals. We see Jennifer's fears about becoming a mother are caused by her rocky relationship with her own mother. We see Beth's ignorance regarding the myriad ways love can manifest and exist. We see Lincoln's insecurities unfold as he attempts to struggle out from beneath his mother's apron and live his own life. While the underlying theme is romance, the story also focuses on family, friends, and personal growth. 
 I know this makes Attachments sound paralyzingly dull, so you'll just have to trust me when I say it's really quite funny. It's probably the funniest book I've read in the last few years. I understand it's probably not for everyone. The pop culture quotes and nerdly references to things like Dungeons & Dragons and The Lord of the Rings might put some readers off, but they were right up my alley. I read the entire book in one sitting, neither needing nor wanting a break. I can't wait to read more from Rainbow Rowell.",110.0,1,4644,4597.56,0.99,511,4,1,1

It was while reading this book in about 1987 that I first felt moved to pick up a pen and begin scratching out my own story. 
 I should say that the book and the movie are forever intertwined in my mind now: When I think of Macon and Muriel, I see William Hurt and Geena Davis. It's very rare for the film version of any book to be anywhere near as good as the source, but in this case both are excellent.

999,Flight Behavior,Barbara Kingsolver,2012,2012,"Flight Behavior takes on one of the most contentious subjects of our time: climate change. With a deft and versatile empathy Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world.
Flight Behavior transfixes from its opening scene, when a young woman's narrow experience of life is thrown wide with the force of a raging fire. In the lyrical language of her native Appalachia, Barbara Kingsolver bares the rich, tarnished humanity of her novel's inhabitants and unearths the modern complexities of rural existence. Characters and reader alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory here, into the unsettled ground of science, faith, and everyday truces between reason and conviction.
Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen. Now, after a decade of domestic disharmony on a failing farm, she has settled for permanent disappointment but seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation with a younger man. As she hikes up a mountain road behind her house to a secret tryst, she encounters a shocking sight: a silent, forested valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand it as a cautionary miracle, but it sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists, religious leaders, and the media. The bewildering emergency draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists, opportunists, sightseers, and a striking biologist with his own stake in the outcome. As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle, Dellarobia confronts her family, her church, her town, and a larger world, in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed.
Flight Behavior takes on one of the most contentious subjects of our time: climate change. With a deft and versatile empathy Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world.",Fiction,Intermediate,8,3,13,9.75,2,3.76,58112,2.0,"I love Barbara Kingsolver. All of her books automatically go on my to-read list, because she's brilliant. One of the things I love about her is how unique her books are from one another. She writes different kind of characters in disparate environments and focuses on varying themes. I find it so impressive when authors can reinvent themselves so often. Flight Behavior is my fourth Kingsolver book. Unfortunately, unlike the others, this one failed to meet my expectations. 
 My first Kingsolver read was The Bean Trees, which centers around a girl desperate to get out of her small, hick town where most of the girls are pregnant before they even leave high school. She wants to be one of the ones to leave and never come back. Through some odd circumstances, she finds herself stuck raising a baby that's not hers, sort of falling into motherhood. The plot itself didn't have much appeal for me as a reader, but the book was utterly compelling and I loved it so much. Kingsolver's powerful writing and intriguing, quirky characters pulled me in despite myself. 
 In Flight Behavior, Kingsolver again focuses on a heroine who had dreams of escaping her hick town, but this one didn't make it. Dellarobia hoped to go to college, but wound up pregnant instead. Even worse, the baby boy died, leaving her stuck in a marriage with a man she doesn't respect and reliant on judgmental in-laws. Her unhappiness manifests itself in a wandering eye; she has had a number of crushes on men, flirted with the idea of an affair. The hook of the novel is when Dellarobia heads up the mountain to meet with one of her men and cheat on her husband. On her way, she sees the forest burning with butterflies, and interprets that as a sign from God that she needs to go back to her life and make good. 
 Dellarobia's life certainly is unfortunate, and it's such a shame that her promise was wasted on this small town, where kids only take two years of rudimentary math in school. Even the bright ones aren't given enough education to be able to get out of town. I feel for her, but I didn't connect with her or any of the other characters. In all of Kingsolver's previous works, I was held rapt in unfamiliar worlds by the power of the characters and the writing, but these characters simply failed to grab onto my heart and take hold. 
 Another problem too is that, while the writing is beautiful as always (and shows that you can not write in dialect but still achieve a southern feel), the story feels a bit like a combination of two of the Kingsolver books I'd previously read: The Bean Trees and Prodigal Summer. Revisiting old themes, while not what I know Kingsolver for, can be done well, but, in this case, it felt repetitive and less well done. 
 Flight Behavior feels like it was written not so much for the characters as to be the vehicle for a message: global warming is real and it's not just about changing temperatures. Now, of course, it's alright for books to have a moral, a message, but I don't like to feel like I'm being beat over the head with it or being talked down to. 
 The butterflies Dellarobia witnessed normally wintered in Mexico, but moved to her small town because of environmental changes and now the whole population of Monarch butterflies could be in danger of extinction. A lepidopterist comes to study them, and works with and teaches Dellarobia, highlighting her boredom with her husband and her desire for something bigger. Because of her rudimentary education, the reader receives both the scientific explanations for everything and the 'country' version, a cute little metaphor for everything that's happening. This felt a bit insulting to me, as though this setting was chosen to allow for global warming to be explained in a simplified way that the stupid disbelievers could fathom. Prodigal Summer also dealt with the importance of taking care of the environment, but did not make me feel so lectured. 
 Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh, but I'm disappointed to have not enjoyed a book by one of my favorite authors. Her writing is still gorgeous, but the book is massive, slow, and filled with a lot of minutiae about Dellarobia's life I could have done without. Surely others will appreciate this one (most of the reviews on Goodreads are highly flattering and NPR approves), but it fell flat with me.",184.0,1,4360,4316.4,0.99,1085,4,2,3
1000,Survivors,James Wesley Rawles,2011,2011,"WHAT IF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT ENDED TOMORROW?The America we are accustomed to is no more. Practically overnight the stock market has plummeted, hyperinflation has crippled commerce, and the fragile chains of supply and high-technology infrastructure have fallen. The power grids are down. Brutal rioting and looting grip every major city. The volatile era known as ""the Crunch"" has begun, and this new period in our history will leave no one untouched. In this unfamiliar environment, only a handful of individuals are equipped to survive.
Andrew Laine, a resourceful young U.S. Army officer stationed overseas in Afghanistan, wants nothing more than to return home to Bloomfield, New Mexico. With the world in turmoil and all air and sea traffic to America suspended, Laine must rely on his own ingenuity and the help of good Samaritans to reach his family. Andrew will do whatever it takes to make it home to his fiancee, no matter how difficult the circumstances.
Major Ian Doyle is a U.S. Air Force pilot sta-tioned in Arizona with his wife, Blanca. Their young daughter, Linda, is trapped in the North- eastern riots. Three teenage orphans, Shadrach, Reuben, and Matthew Phelps, have no choice but to set out on their own when their orphanage closes at the beginning of the Crunch. Then there is Ignacio Garcia, the ruthless leader of the criminal gang called La Fuerza, who will stop at nothing to amass an army capable of razing the countryside. And over everything looms the threat of a provisional government, determined to take over America and destroy the freedoms upon which it was built.

If everything you thought you knew suddenly fell apart, would you survive?",Fiction,Intermediate,2,3,11,7.0,14,3.5,1466,1.0,"If I could give negative stars, I think I would. I read the whole book in two days mainly because I started skimming towards the end. Normally, I love post-apocalyptic tales and, since I'd found this author's previous non-fiction book to be fascinating, I thought I would likely enjoy this book, too. I didn't. I fully expected the writing to be mediocre, and I was okay with that as long as I got an interesting and informative story. Unfortunately, the story was filled with unbelievable characters who could do everything well and who preached at me constantly. There was no plot, just paper people running around surviving because they could shoot other people and because they were such wonderful Christians. The timeline was all screwed up, too. We, the readers, were jerked back and forth through time and space so often with so little warnings that I struggled keep track of where the story was and who I was reading about. Most of the info about surviving in a collapsed economy came down to having guns and gold or silver. Some of what was written might have been handy or interesting if I knew more about guns already, but rattling off gun names and characteristics doesn't teach me much. I perked up a little when he wrote that Magic Flash cubes can be rigged as an alarm system, but he never said how it was done, so I'm not sure how useful that was. One thing I did learn that could be useful is that most bad guys have shaved heads and tattoos. I'll make sure to watch out for that type. 
 I hate to just spout complaints about a book, but with this one it's hard to come up with something nice to say. And yet I did read it all the way through, which says something about it. It was oddly compelling and I wanted to like it. In the end, though, the only thing that kept me from throwing the book at the wall was that I didn't want to wake up my sleeping man.",14.0,1,5238,5185.62,0.99,462,4,3,2

There are rumors that something has survived....",Fiction,Intermediate,24,1,15,5.416666666666667,10,3.73,84927,2.0,"The Lost World is not a very good book. The story is a slog to start and the characters are very weak. So weak that if any of them had actually been eaten by the constantly hungry dinosaurs I would've been like: shrug. 
 As the story progressed and I waited impatiently to find out: would they actually solve the mystery of the missing Dr Levine and go to the island of dinosaurs--as if there was a chance of that not happening--I was introduced to a series of these weak characters and it then became a struggle to decide who I wanted to be eaten first. 
 Initially I really wanted one or both of the two genius kids to get chomped. Their place in the book was so formulaic, so PC, and so contrived that it marred the over-all story. They were there simply to add some emotion to a flat read. It didn't work since you just knew neither of them would die.(Side note: Every author should kill a main/well liked character every 5 or 6 books just to keep the possibility out there.) 
 The next on my list of those characters who I wished would just get torn to shreds was Richard Levine, who was a know-it-all bore. It would've been good for him to have been killed very early in the book(maybe chapter 4?)--just as long as he didn't linger in his demise. Whenever Levine opened his mouth he would go on and on, until I found myself skimming. 
 Third on my hit-list was Sarah Harding...I mean Dr Sarah Harding(Everyone has PhDs and multiple PhDs and everyone is all so brilliant that it's tiresome.) Though I would have liked to see Sarah become Dino-kibble it wasn't going to happen. She was a female Tarzan and it was a wonder she didn't kill a T-Rex with a spear. Uhg. I get tired of the PC world (Though to be fair the dinosaurs weren't at all scary. In one scene Dr Levine is stalking a T-rex on a bicycle, completely unafraid, which had me wondering: why did they come to rescue him?) 
 Ironically, the only person that I really wanted to live was a character who had died in the first book. For some reason the author resurrects Ian Malcolm. If you remember, Malcolm hated dinosaurs, yet for some reason he tags along on expedition to a dinosaur infested island to find Levine, a man he really doesn't like. It's completely out of character for him and makes no sense. In fact in the first few chapters he's completely against the idea and then pop! He changes his mind with no real reason given. 
 So all the characters suck and this is because they aren't in-depth people with strong desires and motivations, instead they are talking props. They all seemed to sit about either spewing sciencey knowledge or receiving sciencey knowledge; this they take turns at doing. And everyone is a genius, or so we are told. Judging by their actions however, they are a bunch of morons who deserve to be eaten. 
 So much for the characters, how about the story itself? 
 Dinosaurs are scary. Run everyone. Bad guys die. Good guys live. It was a cheap imitation of a good book: Jurassic Park. I wouldn't bother with this sequel.",17.0,1,55728,556722.72,9.99,658,5,5,2

During the cold December nights they find comfort in each other. But the specter of the workhouse and the possibility of family and personal ruin hang over them, making their every move dangerous. Which would they rather lose: their lives as they know them... or the promise of a future together?",Fiction,Intermediate,4,7,13,10.25,9,3.54,78,4.0,"It was great to find another book set in this era, as Prohibition/Depression America is a hugely untapped market and all in all I enjoyed this story. I felt that perhaps the few problems I found with it were maybe the length of the book, which made it a little difficult to take the characterisation and conflict deeper than it was. 
 I liked Joshua a good deal, he's a man who has been shoved back into the closet because he's had to move back home. Not that he was ""out"" of course, but having his own apartment in New York meant he had a little more freedom over his own life. Now, because his well-to-do family has lost all of its money, he's living back in the large house with his mother and brother his personal life has shrunk to visiting ""Shorty's"" - a bar which welcomes homosexuals and where he's been having an on-off sexual liaison with one of the staff. 
 I liked his sense of obligation to his family without having the resentment that many of us show. That's not to mean that he's a saint, he's grumpy and snappy like all of us. It was with his interraction with his family that one of the gaps showed, for me. The whole missing father arc seems to have been introduced and there's an attempt to solve the situation, but it seemed to me as though it was a plot that was meant to do something, but really didn't. I kept waiting for something to happen-good or bad-but nothing much did. When Joshua's brother Asher fails in what he sets out to do the backlash is glossed over, we are told that Joshua looked after Asher, but that's about it. 
 The thing is, I think, is that the book is bursting out of its ""I'm a gay romance"" skin because there's so much extra world here: the club, the family, the father interest and the romance aspect suffers from all these interesting plot developments that don't come to fulfilment and the other plots suffer a little because of the romance. 
 The second protagonist is Will-or Blue as Joshua first calls him, not knowing his name. He's a new widower trying to protect and support a new-born child on the streets by busking and not doing terribly well at it. It's not exactly a ""gay for you"" plot as it turns out that Will is bisexual, but had been scared senseless away from his gay leanings by his family at a young age, but it's along the lines of ""it's not men, it's just him (Joshua)"" 
 I didn't like Will as much, possibly because we are rarely in his point of view, but I found his constant running away to be irritating-added to the speed that they went from ""I'm straight"" to ""I'm in your bed."" He blames part of his running away on the fact that Joshua was too uptown for him, but this class difference wasn't really stressed-unless it was the oddly inserted riding scene which I didn't see what it was demonstrating. If Joshua had been one of the top nobs in New York I'd have liked that to have been more illustrated, as it wasn't really clear to me until Will starts angsting about it. Apparently too, both men had been noticing each other for a long while as Joshua passed Will in the street but this again isn't particularly strong. He only really notices Will on the day that Will isn't on the corner as expected. 
 The ending was a little odd, and how the conflict is resolved struck me as arbitrary and odd-plus there were a good couple of plot holes that stood out, Joshua would have known what he finds out (sorry to be vague) a lot quicker simply by going to the bar-the fact he stopped going made no sense at all. 
 I had a niggling feeling that it was converted fanfic, due mainly to the appearance of a military coat, and the fact there's a character called Harper and the protagonist has a younger brother, but I've had contact with the author and they assure me that it definitely isn't converted fanfic, so no worries there. 
 I realise that I haven't said it very well, becuase I've been trying to work out why the book didn't blow me away as much as it should have, but I actually did enjoy this book very much. The fact that it gets four stars despite all the issues I've pointed out here demonstrates that, I hope. It was a little schmoopy for me, but there's enough of a hard edge in it too, in all those plots which deserved more time and space to be explored, that pulled it out of the average. Plus a holiday themed book is allowed to be schmoopy by most.

 You know, maybe you shouldn't write your debut novel in the first person from the POV of a character of the opposite gender from yourself? Let alone a different time period and socioeconomic (and educational) background? Just a thought? 
 Well, I kept going. For 129 pages. Until I realized there was no plot. Just lots of drinking, and pretentious talk about art and such. 
 Also, by the time I quit, the main character had coincidentally run into someone while out and about at least 5 times. I thought New York City was a bit bigger than that?

There's no such thing as an empty house...
Trevor, Randy, Ben and Carl grew up together in the small town of Grimshaw as many boys do -- playing hockey and forging friendships that run deep. Twenty-four years later, when Ben commits suicide, the three remaining friends gather once again in their hometown. But going home means going back, and that's not always easy. The three men are forced to confront their memories of a sinister crime that happened in an abandoned house in their neighbourhood -- a crime that claws its way into the present, leaving its indelible mark on everyone.",Fiction,Intermediate,18,1,13,4.888888888888889,8,3.54,765,5.0,"I had first heard of this book by reading a glowing review for it in a newspaper, perhaps The Globe and Mail. 
 So I got on to Goodreads and added it to my to-read list. 
 Where it stayed for about two years. Every time I was deciding what to read next, I would come to this and be cooled by the 3.52 rating. It almost got to the point where I was going to take it off my list altogether. 
 What a mistake that would have been. I am shocked at the average rating of this book. I had only glazed over reviews, only because I wanted to avoid the chance of spoilers (generally negative reviews tend to be rife with them), but from what I can gather, some people have called this a knock off of Stephen King's IT or The Body. 
 Well, I guess if Pyper can be accused of anything, it would be a wonderful portrayal of four young friends in a creepy setting, and a revisit of the town's Bad Thing in their adult years. 
 GUILTY AS CHARGED! 
 This book was outstanding. Like King, he writes kids great, and also writes them great as adults. He also creeped the hell out of me. This morning as I was nearing the finish, I was lying on the couch where the telephone is over my head. Alone in the house, of course. Yes, the phone has to ring 
 just as Trevor is discovering the body in the crawlspace 
 and scare the bejeezus out of me. 
 Pyper is a hell of a writer. There are so many turns of phrases that I found so wonderful and unique that I would love to share them here, but I hate putting quotes in reviews out of context. They are best discovered as they are served.

However, to varying degrees, I enjoyed them all. 
 And whilst there is a common theme to the stories within this anthology, each of them differ, and each of them bring something different to the table, and so I'm going to give a tiny review of my thoughts on each one. 
 Reviewed in the order I read them: 
 Dragon Flight by J. Keller Ford 
 Let me just preface this one by saying that, despite its title, there ain't no dragons in there, and there ain't no flying. However, the author DOES give us an original, unique, unexpected, intriguing, and heart-warming tale that I found myself enjoying a LOT and left me eager to see what else this antho had to offer. 
 A Morrow More by Danielle E. Shipley 
 The world built in this one was well done and interesting, and the concept an intriguing one. However, whilst the 'dragon' took me a little by the surprise, I found the ending to be quite predictable. This would definitely suit fans of fantasy-based worlds, though. 
 Dark Rose by Marissa Halvorson 
 Whilst an interesting premise, the story was pretty slow to begin, although it did eventually pick up a little. And whilst the ending wrapped it up for the most part, I didn't feel the what or why of it all was explained as well as it could have been and I was left feeling a little confused. 
 Sleepless Beauty by Kimberly Kay 
 This one was a fast-paced fairy tale with a twist, some light-hearted humour, and although I foresaw the ending we're given, I still found it fun. 
 Timepiece by Anna Simpson 
 What an imaginative piece this was. It was kind of like Groundhog Day--but not. And kind of like Back to the Future--but not. It was definitely, however, fast-paced, amusing, entertaining, frustrating, thriller-ish, and extremely sweet all rolled into one. VERY enjoyable. 
 The Thirteenth Day by L.S. Murphy 
 This story had a GREAT premise. Very original. Very well executed. With a likeable MC, who I found easy to connect with. Out of all of the stories, this one seemed the most fulfilling, but then as headliner, this story is twice as long as the others. And the outcome at the end? I won't spoil it for you, but I had definite goosebumps at the realisation of exactly what Nixon's actions had resulted in. Very good. 
 Stage Fright by Erika Beebe 
 This one was also enjoyable to read because the descriptions of the play happening onstage were so well executed, I could envision every step despite never having seen the portrayed musical. However at the same time, the story itself was creepy yet intriguing--but in a good and wholly speculative kind of way. 
 So, as you can see, I pretty much enjoyed all of these tales at some level, but if I had to draw my favourite, it's a toughie, because right now, I'm struggling to call it between The Thirteenth Day, Timepiece, and Dragon Flight--so how about we call it a three-way tie. :D

1013,Love The One You’Re With,Emily Giffin,2008,2008,"The New York Timesbestselling author of Something Borrowed,Something Blue,and Baby Proofdelivers another captivating novel about women and the choices that define them. This is the story for anyone who has ever wondered: How can I truly love the one I'm with when I can't forget the one who got away?
Ellen and Andy's first year of marriage doesn't just seem perfect, it is perfect. There is no question how deep their devotion is, and how naturally they bring out the best in each other. But one fateful afternoon, Ellen runs into Leo for the first time in eight years. Leo, the one who brought out the worst in her. Leo, the one who left her heartbroken with no explanation.

 This is my second favorite Emily Giffin book (behind Something Borrowed). There was a similar dynamic between Ellen and Margot, much like that of Rachel and Darcy in Something Borrowed. While the premise of the book wasn't the same, you get the same test of loyalty since Ellen is married to Margot's older brother Andy. In fact, I would say that the test of loyalty might be stronger due to the blood relationship between Margot and Andy. 
 Anyways, I don't want to say too much, I had a feeling as to how the book would end given the title...it was just my intrigue to see how Ellen would get from point a to point b. 
 The premise of the story is something I think most people can relate to, male or female, as at some point in our lives I suspect we have all felt the same way about the road not taken. Whether it be a relationship, a job, college...etc. So this made Ellen very easy to relate to...

1014,Anathem,Neal Stephenson,2008,2008,"Fraa Erasmas is a young avout living in the Concent of Saunt Edhar, a sanctuary for mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers, protected from the corrupting influences of the outside ""saecular"" world by ancient stone, honored traditions, and complex rituals. Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls. Three times during history's darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe, becoming out of necessity even more austere and less dependent on technology and material things. And Erasmas has no fear of the outside--the Extramuros--for the last of the terrible times was long, long ago.
Now, in celebration of the week-long, once-in-a-decade rite of Apert, the fraas and suurs prepare to venture beyond the concent's gates--at the same time opening them wide to welcome the curious ""extras"" in.

Suddenly burdened with a staggering responsibility, Erasmas finds himself a major player in a drama that will determine the future of his world--as he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey that will carry him to the most dangerous, inhospitable corners of the planet . . . and beyond.",Fiction,Intermediate,4,1,15,9.25,8,4.18,45672,5.0,"Oh my lord, this is still one of my top ten favorite works of literature. Like. Ever. 
 Not only has this seminal masterwork of fiction withstood a second read with flying colors, but it continues to define and defy both Science Fiction and Speculative Fiction categories. Heck, I think we can say it belongs on any Philosophy shelf, too, and I defy anyone to not laugh their heads off at the haircuts or Rakes or so many beautiful easter-eggs of ideas studded through the opening couple hundred pages. 
 What? It's just a bunch of monks talking philosophy and science in an alien world? How the heck could that be fun? 
 Ahh, this book moves on from that soon enough, especially when mysteries both small and really large start piling up, and the high-tech history of the world with it's truly awesome advances is only *part* of the reveals in store for us. 
 The world building is probably the most fantastic and excellent that I've ever read in any novel, and I'm even including masterworks like Dune and Foundation in this category. More than anything, it's the history and the alternate progressions of thought and development that is so close to our own history that is so amazing. And funny. Screw Occam's Razor. We've got a Rake. ;) 
 Little easter eggs abound in the opening that make so much more sense later in the novel, and on the second read, they're even better because we know what to expect. Causal Domain Shear? What's that? A haircut? OMG. 
 Do *not* expect this to remain a sleepy monk community that has remained cloistered with a few exceptions for 5 thousand years. 
 *Do* expect some truly wonderful and crazy science, philosophy, action and adventure, aliens, space-travel, time and space hacking, immortality, shaolin monks kicking all sorts of ass, horrible world killers, and multiple dimensions. 
 Holy crap, right? 
 It's a damn near perfect story, including great characters, pacing, reveals, science, politics, philosophy, and even religion and poetry. It also continues to blow my mind. How can something this complicated in its entirety read so easily, so effortlessly? But it does, and it's funny as hell, too. 
 I remember my first reading of this getting under my skin and confounding me at the same time. I kept wanting to categorize and pigeonhole it, and with every new hint that came along to tell me that I was going to fail miserably, I slowly got the hint that I just needed to go with the flow, trust the author, and just get fully immersed. There's no other way around it. 
 And there has never been a book quite like this in my life, ever before or ever since. 
 I can't even say that my love of this novel is a case of right place, right time, because with the second read almost eight years after the first, you'd think that I'd have grown as a person. I've certainly read a lot of new books, too. But, alas, this one still packs one hell of a punch. 
 The total-action scenes at the climax had me gasping for air, literally. I actually started crying from just how freaking awesome it all was. :) 
 Don't ever let any tell you that there is nothing new under the sun, or that SF or literature is dumbing down. This is one of the smartest pieces of fiction I've ever read. I am in awe.",55.0,1,6021,30044.79,4.99,403,5,2,2
1015,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,Seth Grahame-Smith,2010,2012,"Indiana, 1818. Moonlight falls through the dense woods that surround a one-room cabin, where a nine-year-old Abraham Lincoln kneels at his suffering mother's bedside. She's been stricken with something the old-timers call ""Milk Sickness.""
""My baby boy..."" she whispers before dying.
Only later will the grieving Abe learn that his mother's fatal affliction was actually the work of a vampire.
When the truth becomes known to young Lincoln, he writes in his journal, ""henceforth my life shall be one of rigorous study and devotion. I shall become a master of mind and body. And this mastery shall have but one purpose..."" Gifted with his legendary height, strength, and skill with an ax, Abe sets out on a path of vengeance that will lead him all the way to the White House.
While Abraham Lincoln is widely lauded for saving a Union and freeing millions of slaves, his valiant fight against the forces of the undead has remained in the shadows for hundreds of years. That is, until Seth Grahame-Smith stumbled upon The Secret Journal of Abraham Lincoln, and became the first living person to lay eyes on it in more than 140 years.
Using the journal as his guide and writing in the grand biographical style of Doris Kearns Goodwin and David McCullough, Seth has reconstructed the truelife story of our greatest president for the first time-all while revealing the hidden history behind the Civil War and uncovering the role vampires played in the birth, growth, and near-death of our nation.",Fiction,Intermediate,7,4,15,8.0,6,3.7,1643,5.0,"""Without death,"" he answered, ""life is meaningless. It is a story that can never be told. A song that can never be sung. For how would one finish it?"" 
 Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is an impeccable example of how history can be made interesting with strategy. Even though I'm vastly interested in history, reading huge textbooks or listening to commentaries still makes me sleepy. I've read about how Lincoln died many times now, from different sources, but I never understood why it happened. I also never really knew much about him other than he was a former U.S President. I'm sure that if I grew up in the U.S then I would have vast knowledge of him, but sadly I didn't. I heard that this book was heavily researched on, so I'm guessing I now have at least a brief introduction on who Lincoln was as a President. Events were obviously coated with the vampire-fantasy gimmick, but I still see some as real events that happened. 
 Before reading this I already knew I was going to enjoy it. The premise was straightforward and it caught my interest immediately. Despite numerous 1-2 star reviews, I went ahead and decided to read this book anyway. Such a great decision I made. 
 The writing was near perfect. The way that the author alternated from his narration and Lincoln's journal was very interesting. If it was an attempt to maintain the reader's interest, then he clearly succeeded, at least with me. I'm clearly happy with the historical vibe of the novel, and the way that it didn't venture out of it. Some other authors would mistakenly write about things that are not present in the time that they're trying to portray. I didn't see anything wrong with SG-S' writing, so I'm clearly satisfied. 
 The plot was in parr with the premise. It showed Lincoln's life, as a vampire hunter. A parody but life lessons were still present. That's the great thing about reading fiction, not only does it interest you, but it also teaches. If I were to quote all of the things I thought were life lessons then this review wouldn't be a review, but rather a short preview. All you need to know is that it was really amazing. Here's one of my favorites though: 
 """"Judge us not equally, Abraham, We may all deserve hell, but some of us deserve it sooner than others."" 
 The characters were all interesting and genuine. Genuine in a way that they weren't pretentious. The author also didn't make them seem unbelievable. Another reason why I like the writing of this novel. Also the way that Abe developed was really good. It was very well incorporated to the vampire aspect of the novel. No cheesy vampire romance here. The vampires are violent and merciless. I would also like it mention that the author was rather harsh with the outcome of some characters. I'm not sure if they really happened, but the harshness managed to interest me too. I don't have a faint heart, and the darker the novel the better, for me. 
 I can't wait the read the sequel of this. I heard though that it can be read as a standalone, considering it's Henry's point of view, and that makes me even more excited. I really liked Henry here, so reading about the what he decides to do after Abraham's death is clearly exciting. I'm glad the author made a sequel about him. 
 5/5 stars. This is my first read of Seth Grahame-Smith, and clearly it's not going to be my last. He managed to exceed my expectations. I don't give out 5 stars that often, but this novel clearly deserves it. Highly recommended. Will probably read this again in the future.",65.0,1,348,344.52,0.99,291,1,3,4

1017,The Bride Collector,Ted Dekker,2010,2010,A string of exquisite young women have been murdered by a single individual who leaves his signature with each body: a pristine bridal veil. FBI agent Brad Raines must turn to a most unusual source for help.,Fiction,Intermediate,1,14,14,14.0,16,3.84,7665,2.0,"I've never read a Ted Dekker book, yet I'd been told great things about him & his work. When I got the chance to review this, I figured that this would be a great chance to experience the author. I just wish that this had lived up to all of the hype. 
 The book follows the character of FBI agent Brad Raines, a man who is no stranger to loss. With his own dark past looming over him, he attempts to uncover the identity of a killer known only as the Bride Collector. The Bride Collector has tracked down several extraordinarily beautiful women, then murdered them & left them in a macabre pose. Searching for answers, Raines travels to a local mental institution where he meets the enigmatic Paradise- a woman who has the unique talent of drawing out the last memories of the dead. 
 (Might be considered spoilers by some) 
 Where do I begin? First off, there's far too many coincidences in this book. The killer just so happens to be able to not only ID the FBI agents working the case, but he also manages to find out where they live- & manages to do all of this without gaining any attention to himself. That I'd be willing to overlook. BUT there's something else that bugged me more. It irked me that just about everyone not only accepted that Paradise- a patient in a mental institution- was able to read dead bodies, but that they brought one of the bodies to the institute for her to read. Really? Seriously now... even if Raines was the type to believe in the supernatural, it would be near impossible for them to move the body to a mental institution for an inmate to touch- just on the say so that she was able to read the dead. Now if there'd been some sort of buildup where Raines & his FBI partners had researched Paradise, discovered that the stories all checked out & then mentioned how they had to sneak the body away, then I'd be less skeptical. I was also skeptical about the romance that I was supposed to believe was developing between Paradise & Raines. There just wasn't any chemistry between the two of them & as such, it all felt a little forced to me. 
 I can't help but think that if Dekker had fleshed out the romance & tried to eliminate some of the plot holes, the story would have been far better. Too much of the story is spent on the main characters re-hashing their own personal angsts over & over again. 
 Now I will say that Dekker does know how to write in order to entertain. As far as entertainment value went, as long as I was willing to ignore the HUGE gaping plot holes & farfetched ideas, I was able to finish the book. This wasn't the worst thing I've read in the thriller genre, but I've read far better by other authors. This might make for an ok beach read, but if you really want a tightly written & semi-plausible storyline, you aren't going to find it in this book. But if you just want something to while away a few hours, this might satisfy you. Offhand, I can't muster enough enthusiasm over this book to give it anything more than 2 stars. I found it entertaining enough to read & finish, but in the end this is just a mediocre book.

 ENGLISH REVIEW 
 If there is one thing Mo Hayder knows is it to write a book that crawls under your skin. She dares, just like Dennis Lehane can she write in such a way that it's with terror you turn each page. 
 Gone is no exception. Reading about kidnapped children is always terrible and you do not know if Jack Caffery will be able to save the kidnapped girl. Caffery is a brilliant police, but in this book, the kidnapper seems to anticipate every single move the police do, and as more time goes by, the fear grows that they will be too late. 
 Then we have police diver Flea Marley, who lives with the consequences from the previous book, which has consequences for her at work. She does not know that Jack suspects her for a crime she's actually innocent of. Although it's quite logical that he suspects her since he doesn't have the whole picture. Now she decides to search for the kidnapped girl. But, is she really in shape to help out? Or will she only risk her own life? 
 Gone is a tough thriller where the unidentified perpetrator always lurks in the background, and at the end, when Caffery confronts the perpetrator will you still question if everything will end happily...

Everyone knows a couple like Jack and Grace. He has looks and wealth, she has charm and elegance. You might not want to like them, but you do.
You'd like to get to know Grace better. But it's difficult, because you realise Jack and Grace are never apart.

In order to tell a more authentic story, Costain uses real characters such as Joseph of Arimithea, Luke, Peter and other Apostles as well as Nero. 
 Basil, the main character, is legally adopted into a wealthy family but when the father dies, his position is usurped by his uncle and he is sold into slavery. Luke finds him as he is a prodigy sculptor and buys him out of slavery giving him status once again as a free man. Luke had been searchig on behalf of Joseph of Arimithea who old and feeble as he is, is intent on securing the best and most talented artisan to design a chalice which will be made to fit the cup used by Jesus at The Last Supper"". Joseph has safeguarded the cup over the years as the Zealots are intent on destroying any remnants of Jesus and eradicating the entire Christian faith. Basil goes through many trials and tribulations on his journey both to restore his good name and to find those central to the rise of Christianity in order to mold them and include their image for ""the Silver Chalice"". 
 Really enjoyed the read. The only thing keeping it from a five star read was at times (in very insignificant places) you had to suspend belief in order to go with the story.",3.0,1,1384,5245.36,3.79,75,2,5,3

Eventually, with his soul nearly broken, Father Time is granted his freedom, along with a magical hourglass and a mission: a chance to redeem himself by teaching two earthly people the true meaning of time.
He returns to our world - now dominated by the hour-counting he so innocently began - and commences a journey with two unlikely partners: one a teenage girl who is about to give up on life, the other a wealthy old businessman who wants to live forever. To save himself, he must save them both.

 back to the review... Albom's explanation of Dor's thought processes in figuring out numbers and time is pure gold. 
 The silver part of the novel is about a high-school girl named Sarah Lemon. She is lonely and unloved. She has a crush on a classmate Ethan. Sarah is eager for time to pass quickly before their first date. Soon, though, her heart is broken, as happens to unpopular lonely high school girls. Her life is tarnished.

1023,Doctor Sleep,Stephen King,2013,2013,"Stephen King returns to the characters and territory of one of his most popular novels ever, The Shining, in this instantly riveting novel about the now middle-aged Dan Torrance (the boy protagonist of The Shining) and the very special 12-year-old girl he must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals.
On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless - mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky 12-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the ""steam"" that children with the ""shining"" produce when they are slowly tortured to death.
Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant ""shining"" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes ""Doctor Sleep.""
Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan's own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra's soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of hyper-devoted fans of The Shining and wildly satisfy anyone new to the territory of this icon in the King canon.",Fiction,Intermediate,21,1,15,6.857142857142857,8,4.1,98088,4.0,"There is a boy (now a man) a girl, a band of baddies with a charismatic leader, a coalition of the willing, battles to be fought, supernatural elements and magical powers. Stephen King was at this long before Harry Potter lived under the stairs. He has a preternatural (not to say supernatural) talent for writing kids, and can keep you turning pages, losing sleep, and getting back late to work from your lunch breaks. 
 We will presume for the purposes of this review that you have read, or at least seen one version of The Shining. If you have not, read no further, as there are details here that would be considered spoilerish were they to appear in a review of that book. And if you have not read The Shining you should probably do so before taking on Doctor Sleep, a sequel. Ok, everyone here has read The Shining, yes? All right, but we are using the honor system here, and do not want to ruin the fun of reading that one for anyone. So, as long as you're sure... 
 At the end of The Shining, three people survive the carnage, Danny Torrance, a five year old with a special gift, Wendy Torrance, Danny's mother and newly widowed wife of the late Jack Torrance, and Dick Halloran, an employee of The Overlook and possessor of a gift like Danny's, one that allowed him to hear Danny's psychic 911 call and return from his home in Florida in time to do something about it. What happened next? 
 from King's site 
 King does not typically do sequels, if one does not count books that are part of a planned series, but Every now and then somebody would ask, 'Whatever happened to Danny?' I used to joke around and say, 'He married Charlie McGee from Firestarter and they had these amazing kids!' But I did sort of wonder about it. - (from EW)One of the central features of The Shining was Jack's Torrance's battle with alcoholism. As with the real world, King's fictional realm notes that alcoholism runs in families. And one of the criticisms of The Shining was that the possibility of Jack considering getting some help from AA is never even raised. If King has ever considered that to have been an oversight, I have not seen that interview. But it is clear that he has given the matter some thought. Jack Torrance never tries Alcoholics Anonymous. That is never even mentioned in ""The Shining."" He has what they call white-knuckle sobriety. He's doing it all by himself. So, I wondered what it would be like to see Danny first as an alcoholic, and then see him in AA. (from an NPR Interview)It gives nothing away to let you know that Danny is a true Torrance. Not only does he self-medicate to quiet the terrors that still haunt him, he is far from the best person he can be.I knew if I did this sequel I'd have to try to put together some of the same elements, but at the same time I didn't want to make it too similar. I didn't want to make Danny a grown up with kids of his own, and try to replicate that whole losing-your-temper-because-you're-drunk thing. But I did think to myself: 'Not only alcoholism can be a family disease, but rage can be a family disease.' You find that the guys who abuse their children were abused themselves as kids. That certainly fit Danny as I knew him. - from EW 
 All SK novels require a baddie, or a set of them. No disappointment here. King has again succeeded in taking the ordinary and making it horrifying.Driving back and forth from Maine to Florida, which I do twice a year, I'm always seeing all these recreational vehicles -- the bounders in the Winnebagos. I always think to myself, 'Who is in those things?' You pass them a thousand times at rest stops. They're always the ones wearing the shirts that say 'God Does Not Deduct From a Lifespan Time Spent Fishing.' They're always lined up at the McDonald's, slowing the whole line down. And I always thought to myself, 'There's something really sinister about those people because they're so unobtrusive, yet so pervasive.' I just wanted to use that. It would be the perfect way to travel around America and be unobtrusive if you were really some sort of awful creature. - from EW 
 This wandering band call themselves The True Knot. They feed on the essence of those gifted with the sort of talent people like Danny possess. It provides them with extraordinary longevity, but as with their Transylvanian counterparts, the need is ongoing and the supply is limited. Like right-wing politicians they are more than happy to gorge on the pain of others and are shown here feasting on the spirits set adrift on 9/11. The usual condiments for this substance they call steam will not do. The taste and benefit is enhanced, however, if their victims endure extreme and prolonged torture. Does Ted Cruz drive a Winnebago? King gives the members Damon Runyon-esque names, like Crow Daddy, Steamboat Steve and Tommy the Truck. 
 By the time you finish reading Doctor Sleep you might have a new image of the top hat to consider next time you are planning a formal night out. We all have one, probably this one: 
 But the baddie in Stephen King's latest is likely to do for the top hat what this guy 
 did for the derby. Rose O'Hara, the leader of a group called The True Knot, won't leave home without it. It adds a nice visual element, calling to mind a certain Caribbean Baron, and making Rosie even more riveting. 
 And what of our young heroine? Abra is born with a shining of prodigious proportions. (btw, the name Abra was inspired by Abra Bacon, a character in East of Eden) She manages to send out a signal even when she is newly arrived. She's a good kid, despite scaring her parents on occasion with tricks like making all the silverware in the kitchen take to the air, or causing the odd earthquake when she does a mental Bruce (or if you prefer, David) Banner. Don't make her angry. You wouldn't like her when she's angry. Bad-ass teen girl power fuh shoo-uh. But, just as Danny needed Dick Hallorann and Tony, Abra needs help as well. That she and Danny will team up is a foregone conclusion. 
 As for Danny, the shining never left him, despite his attempts to wipe it out with spirits of a different sort. But he finds the help he needs and manages to put his talent to good use. He works in a hospice, the Helen Rivington House, in Frazier, NH, easing the transition for those near death, with the assistance of a resident feline, and earning himself the name Doctor Sleep, which also serves to remind us of what his parents called him....It is this moment of transition that Doctor Sleep deals with and the idea, like so many of King's, came from an incidental story in a newspaper. This one was about ""a cat in a hospice that knows when people are going to die. He would go into that patient's room and curl up next to them. And I thought, that's a good advertisement for death, for the emissary of death. I thought, 'I can make Dan the human equivalent of that cat, and call him Doctor Sleep.' There was the book."" - from an interview in The Guardian 
 King has a bit of fun, naming the cat Azzie, short for Azreel, the archangel of death. Cute. 
 What else do you need, really? Dark vs light, colorful baddies vs our everyman and everygirl. And that is indeed enough. But it is not all that King uses. He gives us a look at how people can really help people overcome, or at least handle their problems. When asked, in the NPR interview, whether his AA depictions were from personal experience, King says that the second part of AA stands for Anonymous, so he declined to offer a yes or no, however You could say, having read these two books and knowing that I was a very heavy drinker at the time that I wrote ""The Shining,"" and I haven't had a drink in about 25 years now - you could draw certain conclusions from that...I've done a lot of personal research in these subjects. - from NPR interview 
 AA figures very large in this story, is central really. And the wisdom one can find in AA permeates the novel, from the importance of recognizing that we need help from others, to accepting our past and dealing with it, a very strong, serious element. 
 King sets the time of the events by referring to external realities, like who the president is, calls on contemporary cultural references, such as a mention of the Sons of Anarchy and a Hank Wiliams Jr song. He also mentions a variety of other writers in his travels, some approvingly, (John Sandford, George Seferis, Bernard Malamud, Bill Wilson) some not so much (the authors of the Twilight and Hunger Games series, and Dean Koontz and Lisa Gardner, although he may merely be playing with the latter two). He also drops in an Easter egg reference to Salem's Lot and make two references (that I caught anyway) to his son, Joe's, imagined world from Joe's book, NOS4A2. 
 It has been my experience with reading Stephen King that his conclusions sometimes offer a poor partner to the journey one takes in reaching them. That is much less the case here. The ending is not an alien spider disguised as Tim Curry with bad fashion sense or alien young playing with humans in a ham-fisted manner. And the journey is indeed fun. But I had some gripes. King gives Dick Hallorann a cameo here, which was fine, and the strongest of those. Tony returns for a look-see but goes alarmingly quiet at crucial moments. We could have used a lot more about Tony other than the weak explanation that is offered near the end. If the True Knot are so bad-ass, how come there are so few of them? There is an explanation offered of prey-predator stability of numbers, but I found that unpersuasive. And why the hell introduce Jack if he is not going to be a part of the action? This is one that actively irked. 
 Sequels present a danger. One of the things that is stimulating about any book, any story is newness. That is why most sequels are not as popular as their predecessors. It is hard to avoid a been-there-done-that problem when working atop existing material. The next story in line is unlikely to retain the sparkle, the shine of what went before. Given the constraints, Doctor Sleep fares better than most as a follow-on. There is enough distance in the story from the events of the past, and little enough overlap with those characters that the story seems fresh. When events from The Shining are mentioned, they do inform the current action and do not distract much. In fact there could have been more of that. So, in that way, this is a very nice addition. There is another element involved. Any event, any activity, is a product of the thing itself and of the perspective from which we view or participate in it. I read The Shining many years ago. I was an adult then, in my late twenties, and remember it as a VERY SCARY story. I have not come across much in horror lit that is still scary in that way, in the several decades since. I will not have any nights (on in my case days) of lost sleep because of the images King has proferred. But then, I am getting on, and am looking at those scary things with aging eyes. Someone younger (which would be almost all of you reading this) might find them far more frightening than I did. 
 So while Doctor Sleep might not cause much by way of lost rest, it is good, mainstream Stephen King and thus, hardly a snooze. The Doctor of Horror is in. Wake up!

1026,The Cider House Rules,John Irving,1985,1986,"Raised from birth in the orphanage at St. Cloud's, Maine, Homer Wells has become the protege of Dr. Wilbur Larch, its physician and director. There Dr. Larch cares for the troubled mothers who seek his help, either by delivering and taking in their unwanted babies or by performing illegal abortions. Meticulously trained by Dr. Larch, Homer assists in the former, but draws the line at the latter. Then a young man brings his beautiful fiancee to Dr. Larch for an abortion, and everything about the couple beckons Homer to the wide world outside the orphanage ...",Fiction,Intermediate,21,1,14,5.761904761904762,6,4.1,321,4.0,"Hey! I just popped my John Irving cherry with The Cider House Rules! 
 Something strange happened midway through reading The Cider House Rules, my first John Irving book.* I found myself completely immersed in its world. 
 What's strange is that for the first couple hundred pages, I didn't particularly believe in this early 20th century Dickensian fable about orphans, surrogate families, an ether-addicted abortionist and the arbitrariness of some rules. But Irving's storytelling skills eventually won me over. His prose is persuasive. 
 Homer Wells is raised in an orphanage in the isolated town of St. Cloud's, Maine. Although he's been placed with families four separate times, something has always gone wrong with his adoptions, and so he continually ends up back at the orphanage, where he eventually assists Dr. Wilbur Larch in his unusual obi/gyn practice. 
 Women come to St. Cloud's to either give their children up for adoption or have the doctor terminate their pregnancies. When Homer is old enough to understand the latter, he decides to stop helping with those procedures. And when Wally Worthington and Candy Kendall, a glamorous young couple who've come to terminate their own unexpected pregnancy, tell Homer about the apple orchards back home near the ocean, he leaves with them, planning to stay just for a week or so to learn about orchards for the orphanage. 
 The book essentially recounts Homer's coming-of-age. Out in the big bad world, he realizes that evil and temptation exist, and that moral choices aren't so black and white. Having grown up in an old-fashioned world, presided over by Larch and Nurses Edna (who's secretly in love with Larch) and Angela, he's been insulated. Choices seem so much easier in the books that he used to read to the orphans: Dickens's Great Expectations and David Copperfield (for the boys), and Jane Eyre for the girls. 
 In a sense, Homer sets out to realize his own great expectations, working in the orchards that Wally's mother runs, falling in love with Candy and forging a lasting friendship with Wally. Meanwhile, Dr. Larch, who's addicted to inhaling ether, is getting older; the board of the orphanage is looking to replace him. Will Homer eventually return? 
 Anyone who's only seen the film version will be surprised by a plotline about another major character, Melony, an orphan who initiates Homer into sex and feels betrayed by his departure. She's determined to track him down, but her motivations remain vague. Revenge? Jealousy? Again: because Irving is such a smooth and skilled writer, the Melony sections are always readable and provide a bit of tension in a plot that can sometimes feel loose. 
 A few other quibbles: Homer's decision to leave with Candy and Wally feels odd, especially since he just meets them. Often the book's humour works, but just as often it feels contrived. And I felt cheated at the end when some big secrets are revealed - things we've anticipated for half the book - and we don't get to see the characters' responses. 
 But I came to love Irving's people. I loved seeing them interact with each other, pick up experience, get older, reflect on their earlier selves. They'll teach you about the female reproductive system or how many bushels of apples it takes to create a vat of cider. They'll make you consider how something as simple as a Ferris Wheel might seem mysterious and magical, or how it might feel to ride a bicycle if you've never ridden one before. 
 I also liked the book's central allegory about blindly following rules. At times the theme felt a bit didactic, but at others times it felt beautifully integrated into the story. 
 The author has great empathy for his characters. And he knows how to create an entire fictional world. The details might not seem true in today's busy, cynical world, but they do in the world of the book. And that's enough for me. 
 I'm looking forward to entering another one of Irving's fictional worlds soon.

1027,The Street Lawyer,John Grisham,1998,2005,"Michael was in a hurry. He was scrambling up the ladder at Drake & Sweeney, a giant D.C. law firm with eight hundred lawyers. The money was good and getting better; a partnership was three years away. He was a rising star with no time to waste, no time to stop, no time to toss a few coins into the cups of panhandlers. No time for a conscience.
But a violent encounter with a homeless man stopped him cold. Michael survived; his assailant did not. Who was this man? Michael did some digging, and learned that he was a mentally ill veteran who'd been in and out of shelters for many years. Then Michael dug a little deeper, and found a dirty secret, and the secret involved Drake & Sweeney.

1032,Revival,Stephen King,2014,2014,"In a small New England town, in the early 60s, a shadow falls over a small boy playing with his toy soldiers. Jamie Morton looks up to see a striking man, the new minister. Charles Jacobs, along with his beautiful wife, will transform the local church. The men and boys are all a bit in love with Mrs Jacobs; the women and girls - including Jamie's mother and beloved sister - feel the same about Reverend Jacobs. With Jamie, the Reverend shares a deeper bond, based on their fascination with simple experiments in electricity.
Then tragedy strikes the Jacobs family; the preacher curses God, mocking all religious belief, and is banished from the shocked town.
Jamie has demons of his own. In his mid-thirties, he is living a nomadic lifestyle of bar-band rock and roll. Addicted to heroin, stranded, desperate, he sees Jacobs again - a showman on stage, creating dazzling 'portraits in lightning' - and their meeting has profound consequences for both men. Their bond becomes a pact beyond even the Devil's devising, and Jamie discovers that revivalhas many meanings. Because for every cure there is a price...
This rich and disturbing novel spans five decades on its way to the most terrifying conclusion Stephen King has ever written. It's a masterpiece from King, in the great American tradition of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe.",Fiction,Intermediate,10,1,14,5.0,10,3.75,2384,3.0,"When Jamie Morton first encounters the Reverend Charles Daniel Jacobs, he is six years old. Jacobs cures his brother's muteness, only to leave town a broken man when his wife and son are killed. Jamie and the Rev will cross paths again and again as the Rev seeks to master what he calls the secret electricity, the energy that powers the universe... 
 I found this book to be an extremely mixed bag, which you'll read in a moment. 
 Revival follows the life of Jamie Morton, a rhythm guitarist, whose life intersects with Charles Jacobs, a priest/huckster/mad scientist who things electricity is the key to most of life's mysteries. I'm going to keep this as spoiler-free as possible. 
 Since Stephen King produces best sellers more often than I wash my car, I tend to forget what a great writer he is. I think if he didn't love scaring the piss out of people, he probably would have been a literary writer of some renown. The characters he creates in this seem very real, with an exception I'll cover in a minute. The picture he paints of Jamie Morton's life is very well written, warts and all. 
 While I enjoyed reading the book due to the Kingliness of the writing, it wasn't all that exciting. I was interested in Jamie's journey from rock and roller to drug addict to studio musician but the meat of the story was whenever he crossed paths with Charles Jacobs, or whatever he was calling himself at the time. Structurally, it reminded me of The Shining. There was a long buildup with just enough teasing to keep me interested. If it wasn't for the ending, I probably would have given this a two. 
 The other thing that didn't quite sit right is that Jacobs evolved from being one cartoonish stereotype to another, from devout priest to carny to evangelist to scene-chewing villain. He's the one character I never really believed in. Also, what's with Stephen King's recent obsession with carnies? Doctor Sleep and Joyland both featured them and now this one. 
 All that being said, I was entertained by Revival but not enthralled by it. I LOVED the glimpse of the afterlife at the end. ""That is not dead which can eternal lie"" indeed. Also, the King Easter eggs were also cool. 
 I didn't love it but it's definitely better than Joyland, Doctor Sleep, and Mr. Mercedes. We'll call it 3.5 out of 5.",143.0,1,2916,14550.84,4.99,953,3,3,4

What no one knows is that the President issues the pardon only after receiving enormous pressure from the CIA. It seems Backman, in his power broker heyday, may have obtained secrets that compromise the world's most sophisticated satellite surveillance system.

Eventually, after he has settled into his new life, the CIA will leak his whereabouts to the Israelis, the Russians, the Chinese, and the Saudis. Then the CIA will do what it does best: sit back and watch. The question is not whether Backman will survive, there is no chance of that. The question the CIA needs answered is, who will kill him?

 This was a great read and kept me hooked until the end. The danger the main character was in felt real and exposed the potential power plays going on at the highest levels of American government and within the intelligence systems. 
 I wasn't as interested in the well researched history of Italy and the various Italian words and phrases that are included in the narrative but this might be a bonus for some people.

 There are so many things I wish I could say coherently about this book. I was at a loss of words when I finished it three hours ago, and I still am speechless. But I want to write this review while the emotions it evoked are still at their strongest. 
 The writing was superb as always. Picoult doesn't use a lot of ""SAT"" vocabulary, or extremely complex sentence structure, but the way she engages readers with detail and finesse is extraordinary. I am always tempted to read just a single page more, then just one chapter more, until I've gone through the entire 400+ page book. I even forgot to put this on my to-read shelf on Goodreads. 
 Picoult's characters are splendid - by the middle of the book I was immersed in Zoe's yearning for children and Max's difficulty with alcohol abuse, and I felt like they were real, breathing people. Vanessa's no-nonsense attitude I admired, and side characters like Dara and Lucy I came to love as well. 
 The element that really made me appreciate this novel was Picoult's take on gay marriage, and homosexual inequality in contemporary society. I cannot adequately state how inspiring this book was to me in that regard. Here is one of the many powerful quotes that I had to stop and re-read (I even put this in my favorite quotes section on Facebook)... 
 ""I remember my mother telling me that, when she was a little girl in Catholic school, the nuns used to hit her left hand every time she wrote with it. Nowadays, if a teacher did that, she'd probably be arrested for child abuse. The optimist in me wants to believe sexuality will eventually become like handwriting: there's no right way or wrong way to do it. We're all just wired differently. 
 It's also worth nothing that, when you meet someone, you never bother to ask if he's right- or left- handed. 
 After all: Does it really matter to anyone other than the person holding the pen?""

 SWEDISH REVIEW 
 Om det ar nagot Mo Hayder kan sa ar det att skriva bocker som gar under skinnet pa en. Precis som Dennis Lehane sa vagar hon ta ut svangarna och det ar med isande fasa man laser varje sida. 
 Forsvunnen ar inget undantag. Att lasa om kidnappade barn ar hemskt och man vet inte om Jack Caffery kommer att lyckas radda situationen. Caffery ar en lysande polis, men i denna bok sa verkar det som om kidnapparen kan forutse polisen nasta drag och ju mer tiden gar desto mer lutar det at att det ar forsent, att flickan inte kommer att raddas. 
 Sedan har vi polisdykaren Flea Marley, som lever med konsekvenserna fran foregaende bok, vilket stor henne i jobbet. Hon vet inte om att Jack misstanker henne for ett brott som hon faktiskt ar oskyldig till men som i och med det Jack vet om det ter sig logiskt att han misstanker henne. Nu ger hon sig in kampen for att radda den kidnappade flickan. Men ar hon verkligen i form att ta sig an fallet? Kommer hon istallet bara att riskera sitt eget liv? 
 Forsvunnen ar en ruggig thriller dar den okande forovaren hela tiden lurar i bakgrunden och man sitter pa helspand pa slutet nar Caffery konfronterar forovaren. Fragan ar kommer allting att sluta lyckligt? 
 Tack till Modernista for recensionsexemplaret! 
 ENGLISH REVIEW 
 If there is one thing Mo Hayder knows is it to write a book that crawls under your skin. She dares, just like Dennis Lehane can she write in such a way that it's with terror you turn each page. 
 Gone is no exception. Reading about kidnapped children is always terrible and you do not know if Jack Caffery will be able to save the kidnapped girl. Caffery is a brilliant police, but in this book, the kidnapper seems to anticipate every single move the police do, and as more time goes by, the fear grows that they will be too late. 
 Then we have police diver Flea Marley, who lives with the consequences from the previous book, which has consequences for her at work. She does not know that Jack suspects her for a crime she's actually innocent of. Although it's quite logical that he suspects her since he doesn't have the whole picture. Now she decides to search for the kidnapped girl. But, is she really in shape to help out? Or will she only risk her own life? 
 Gone is a tough thriller where the unidentified perpetrator always lurks in the background, and at the end, when Caffery confronts the perpetrator will you still question if everything will end happily...

1036,Everything Is Illuminated,Jonathan Safran Foer,2002,2003,"A young man arrives in the Ukraine, clutching in his hand a tattered photograph. He is searching for the woman who fifty years ago saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Unfortunately, however, he is aided in his quest by Alex, a translator with an uncanny ability to mangle English into new forms; a 'blind' old man haunted by memories of the war; and an undersexed guide dog named Sammy Davis, Jr, Jr. What they are looking for seems elusive - a truth hidden behind veils of time, language and the horrors of war. What they find turns all their worlds upside down...",Fiction,Intermediate,1,15,15,15.0,11,3.9,4720,3.0,"Foer's bizarre mix of eroticism and WWII horror is somewhat disquieting. I found myself torn between arousal, boredom, horror, and laughter. At times the writing borders on histrionic - the melodrama between the grandfather's lovers becomes ludicrous, and Foer exhibits the excruciating desire to excavate each human emotion from his personnel as his contemporary Lydia Millet. 
 That said, the one stream-of-consciousness scene turns out to be the most powerful moment in the novel. Which is quite an achievement, as even Joyce didn't pull that one off. There's also a scene of gruesome slaughter that ranks as one of the most naturally horrific depictions of WWII horror that I've ever read. Foer is a compassionate writer, but at times I felt this compassion giving way to a detached glibness that soon bored me. 
 So, an odd mixture. His second novel is a bona fide piece of genius, so I'd recommend starting there.",15.0,1,1646,1629.54,0.99,58,2,1,3
1037,The Bride Collector,Ted Dekker,2010,2010,A string of exquisite young women have been murdered by a single individual who leaves his signature with each body: a pristine bridal veil. FBI agent Brad Raines must turn to a most unusual source for help.,Fiction,Intermediate,1,14,14,14.0,16,3.84,7665,5.0,"""An eerie, engaging novel bringing to the light a unique view of those we judge as mental ill."" 
 Being a fan of Ted Dekker, I knew the type of novel I would be reading when I selected The Bride Collector. Dekker is one of my favorite fiction authors. For instance, I knew I would find dark suspense (often not for the squeamish), tight well-written plot and dialogue, and a focus on some component of Christianity.What I did not expect was to begin to question my perception or at least to reconsider my perspective on what is truly considered 'mentally ill.' 
 The story centers around Brad Raines, an FBI agent in pursuit of a deranged serial killer, who engages a select group of residents at the Center for Wellness and Intelligence, a facility for the highly intelligent mentally ill. 
 The killers identity is revealed early in the novel giving the reader an 'insiders view' of the mind of such a psychopath. He is on a mission from God, or so he believes. He kills beautiful women believing that he is delivering them to God and arranges the crime scene to display the victim as a perfect bride. 
 The backdrop of the story is the interaction of Brad Raines with those we call mentally ill. These are exceptional bright people with mental disorders. This comparison of ideologies, the intelligent and the insane, intrigued me. 
 The element of frankness, innocence, and an untainted outlook on life is revealed in one of the most engaging characters, Paradise Foundry. She is intelligent but also damaged by events in her life. She doesn't consider herself mentally ill but has no desire to leave the facility. Fear is her mental illness. 
 Loved this novel and appreciated that it contained no profanity or vulgarity. The best writers have no need for such things in their novels. I recommend it for those that love suspense and/or thrillers but I do warn those that are squeamish. I am looking forward to the next Dekker novel.",7.0,1,478,5253.22,10.99,213,2,1,3
1038,Handle With Care,Jodi Picoult,2009,2009,"When Willow is born with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, her parents are devastated--she will suffer hundreds of broken bones as she grows, a lifetime of pain. Every expectant parent will tell you that they don't want a perfect baby, just a healthy one. Charlotte and Sean O'Keefe would have asked for a healthy baby, too, if they'd been given the choice. Instead, their lives are made up of sleepless nights, mounting bills, the pitying stares of ""luckier"" parents, and maybe worst of all, the what-ifs. What if their child had been born healthy? But it's all worth it because Willow is, funny as it seems, perfect. She's smart as a whip, on her way to being as pretty as her mother, kind, brave, and for a five-year-old an unexpectedly deep source of wisdom. Willow is Willow, in sickness and in health.

It makes me realised that we do sometimes take life for granted, everything we own, the people around us, the money we make and spent. 
 I like how Picoult writes the story from everyone's POV because I learnt to love a character more because as I was reading, I tried to imagine myself in their places and I feel the pain, the struggles, the fights. Especially Charlotte, being a mother, her determination is understandable despite losing friends, respects and family along the way. 
 I don't blame Sean either for not wanting to proceed the lawsuit, it's a matter of choice, (very hard one) really, having not enough funds for Willow's future needs and admitting to the public and to the child herself that you didn't want the child to be born because she's not perfect. 
 And Amelia is a proof where one may seem absolutely normal from the outside but were broken inside leading to self-hatred. Which, I believe some people experienced in real life but only to be seen by society until it's too late. Because some people claims they know somebody inside out but in reality they don't.

 Picoult's characters are splendid - by the middle of the book I was immersed in Zoe's yearning for children and Max's difficulty with alcohol abuse, and I felt like they were real, breathing people. Vanessa's no-nonsense attitude I admired, and side characters like Dara and Lucy I came to love as well. 
 The element that really made me appreciate this novel was Picoult's take on gay marriage, and homosexual inequality in contemporary society. I cannot adequately state how inspiring this book was to me in that regard. Here is one of the many powerful quotes that I had to stop and re-read (I even put this in my favorite quotes section on Facebook)... 
 ""I remember my mother telling me that, when she was a little girl in Catholic school, the nuns used to hit her left hand every time she wrote with it. Nowadays, if a teacher did that, she'd probably be arrested for child abuse. The optimist in me wants to believe sexuality will eventually become like handwriting: there's no right way or wrong way to do it. We're all just wired differently. 
 It's also worth nothing that, when you meet someone, you never bother to ask if he's right- or left- handed. 
 After all: Does it really matter to anyone other than the person holding the pen?"" 
 Beautiful.

He is searching for the woman who fifty years ago saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Unfortunately, however, he is aided in his quest by Alex, a translator with an uncanny ability to mangle English into new forms; a 'blind' old man haunted by memories of the war; and an undersexed guide dog named Sammy Davis, Jr, Jr. What they are looking for seems elusive - a truth hidden behind veils of time, language and the horrors of war. What they find turns all their worlds upside down...",Fiction,Intermediate,1,15,15,15.0,11,3.9,4720,5.0,"One of my best reads of this year so far! Straight into my goodreads favourites! 
 - This novel follows the story of Jonathan, a young man who is visiting Ukraine in the hopes of discovering the woman who saved his Grandfather from the Nazis fifty years before. On arriving in Ukraine Jonathan meets his translator, Alex who will be aiding him with his search. Along with Alex is Alex's Grandfather and his dog, Sammy David Jr, Jr. Their mission takes them around Ukraine and they slowly begin to unearth things relating to Jonathan's family. 
 - The format of this book is something that I really loved but also something that I have seen criticised. There are chapters which follow Jonathan and Alex in the present time, each one of them telling the story from their point of view (I have to say that I found Alex's jumbled English to be hilarious), but there are also chapters that go back in time to Jonathan's Grandfather and what actually happened to him. This intertwining of present day and the building story of Jonathan's ancestors was beautifully done and I'm eager to read something similar in the future! 
 - Overall I found the comedic nature of Alex mixed with the more solemn and dark undertones of the novel to be wonderfully written by Foer, I was pulled in and emotionally battered by the end! 
 - Hilarious, beautiful and heart-breaking. This is definitely a novel I will be rereading in years to come, 5 out of 5 stars from me!",27.0,1,1646,1629.54,0.99,58,2,1,3

1044,Cell,Robin Cook,2014,2006,"There is a reason cell rhymes with hell.
On October 1, God is in His heaven, the stock market stands at 10,140, most of the planes are on time, and Clayton Riddell, an artist from Maine, is almost bouncing up Boylston Street in Boston. He's just landed a comic book deal that might finally enable him to support his family by making art instead of teaching it. He's already picked up a small (but expensive!) gift for his long-suffering wife, and he knows just what he will get for his boy Johnny. Why not a little treat for himself? Clay is feeling good about the future.
That changes in a hurry. The cause of the devastation is a phenomenon that will come to be known as The Pulse, and the delivery method is a cell phone. Everyone's cell phone. Clay and the few desperate survivors who join him suddenly find themselves in the pitch-black night of civilization's darkest age, surrounded by chaos, carnage, and a human horde that has been reduced to its basest nature...and then begins to evolve.
There is really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clay, an arrow points home to Maine, and as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north they begin to see crude signs confirming their direction. A promise, perhaps. Or a threat...

 The story centers around a mass event that turns anyone who happens to be on their cell phone at the time into a zombie. Mass chaos ensues and a small group of survivors bands together and tries to figure out what is going on and how to stop it. Some of the plot-line does have some similarity to The Stand, but the characters are fairly unique, the dialog is good, and the action keeps rolling along at a fairly brisk pace. 
 I really liked this novel. I knew that I probably would, but it was a nice surprise that it was as good as it was.

Perhaps Oscar Wilde's quote - ""We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars"" also sums up (far more successfully and succinctly) at least a large part of this book. 
 Bach's novel and message was perhaps all well and great at the time of publication and in the context of its time. Maybe 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' did seem revolutionary at that time, but now it reads as quite a crude, clumsy and basic attempt at profundity and wisdom. 
 With little flair or much real imagination, what we have is the life and flight of a seagull (the author being a pilot) as a metaphor for life being lived without limits, seemingly as the path to immortality. 
 Neither as strong, compelling or as moving as I'd anticipated and hoped, given the novel's reputation, 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' was overall unfortunately underwhelming. There are faint echoes here of C S Lewis (Narnia/Aslan) - but without the flair for evocative storytelling. Ultimately a disappointing read.

1047,Empire Falls,Richard Russo,2001,2002,"Richard Russo--from his first novel, Mohawk, to his most recent, Straight Man--has demonstrated a peerless affinity for the human tragicomedy, and with this stunning new novel he extends even further his claims on the small-town, blue-collar heart of the country.
Dexter County, Maine, and specifically the town of Empire Falls, has seen better days, and for decades, in fact, only a succession from bad to worse. One by one, its logging and textile enterprises have gone belly-up, and the once vast holdings of the Whiting clan (presided over by the last scion's widow) now mostly amount to decrepit real estate. The working classes, meanwhile, continue to eke out whatever meager promise isn't already boarded up.
Miles Roby gazes over this ruined kingdom from the Empire Grill, an opportunity of his youth that has become the albatross of his daily and future life. Called back from college and set to work by family obligations--his mother ailing, his father a loose cannon--Miles never left home again. Even so, his own obligations are manifold: a pending divorce; a troubled younger brother; and, not least, a peculiar partnership in the failing grill with none other than Mrs. Whiting. All of these, though, are offset by his daughter, Tick, whom he guides gently and proudly through the tribulations of adolescence.
A decent man encircled by history and dreams, by echoing churches and abandoned mills, by the comforts and feuds provided by lifelong friends and neighbors, Miles is also a patient, knowing guide to the rich, hardscrabble nature of Empire Falls: fathers and sons and daughters, living and dead, rich and poor alike. Shot through with the mysteries of generations and the shattering visitations of the nation at large, it is a social novel of panoramic ambition, yet at the same time achingly personal. In the end, Empire Falls reveals our worst and best instincts, both our most appalling nightmares and our simplest hopes, with all the vision, grace and humanity of truly epic storytelling.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,14,14,14.0,12,3.91,91773,5.0,"""Lives are rivers. We imagine we can direct their paths, though in the end there's but one destination, and we end up being true to ourselves only because we have no choice. People speak of selfishness, but that's another folly, because of course there's no such thing."" 
 I've been pondering this quote for some time now after having finished Richard Russo's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, Empire Falls. Is it true that we have no choice in where our lives take us? Do we only perceive that we have choices and opportunities, whereas in fact our paths are predetermined? Or does believing such a precept just mean that one is placing blame on circumstances that can in fact be overcome? The message may be found within the pages of this extraordinary novel. 
 Empire Falls centers on the lives of those characters that live in this small town of Maine. During its glory days, the town flourished due to the logging and textile industries run by the all-powerful Whiting family. Nowadays, the town is run-down, yet many of its inhabitants remain hopeful that some day it will once again prosper. This is due largely to the fact that the mill and the factory remain intact, a vision of what used to be and what could be if someone would only grasp the opportunity. What does remain and stands as the focal point of the actual happenings in the town is the Empire Grill. 
 ""The Empire Grill was long and low-slung, with windows that ran its entire length, and since the building next door, a Rexall drugstore, had been condemned and razed, it was now possible to sit at the lunch counter and see straight down Empire Avenue all the way to the old textile mill and its adjacent shirt factory. Both had been abandoned now for the better part of two decades, though their dark, looming shapes at the foot of the avenue's gentle incline continued to draw the eye."" 
 It is here that we meet Miles Roby, manager of the Empire Grill. What fascinates me about small towns is the fact that many of its people really never get away. Despite economic instability, there is a core of folks that seem to stick it out - perhaps they don't perceive a means of escape or maybe they see the town for what it once was and that memory eclipses any sense of hardship. Miles Roby, with a major push and the support of his mother, did get out only to return once again due to circumstances that seemed out of his control. Now under the thumb of Francine Whiting, reigning heiress to the Whiting fortune, Miles seems to have reached a dead end, much like the town itself. He lives in a shabby apartment over the grill, is soon to be divorced, and has responsibilities to his teenage daughter, Tick, his deadbeat father, Max, and his recovering alcoholic brother, David. Through him we also meet a wealth of other complex individuals - some good, some not so good, and some downright cringe-worthy. And yet, under the masterful pen of Russo, each character is written in a way that completely absorbs your full attention. However mundane each person appears on the surface, he or she still manages to throb with life on each page. The interactions and dialogue in this book are superb - believable, gripping, sometimes sad, and often humorous. 
 The novel is at heart a character-driven story. There exists a plot that is very slowly and deliberately revealed - a couple of turns that I did not fully anticipate. Don't expect quick action - you will be disappointed. And yet, I found myself nearly holding my breath towards the end of the book; I was that entangled with the lives of the characters. I was hopeful for the future of the town and its people. There was something in nearly each person that I could relate to and understand. What I came to realize in the end is that we should each grab hold of our dreams, take control of our circumstances, and in fact change the direction of that river. We may not end up exactly where we imagined, but neither do we need to flounder and succumb to its currents. 
 I think it would be safe to say that even though this is my first (I know right, where have I been?!) Richard Russo novel, he will be on my list of favorite authors! This book has those elements I adore in my books - memorable and extremely well-drawn characters, brilliant writing, and surprising plot twists. 5 stars

Meet Johnny Smith. A young man whose streak of luck ends dramatically in a major car crash. Followed by blackness. A long, long time in cold limbo.
When he wakes up life has been turned upside down. His fiancee has met someone else. And Johnny is cursed with the power to perceive evil in men's souls. He's had these hunches since he had an ice-skating accident as a child. Now he has an ability to see into the future. An ability which will bring him into a terrifying confrontation with a charismatic, power-hungry and dangerous man...",Fiction,Intermediate,32,1,14,7.75,4,3.9,1135,4.0,"Johnny Smith is one bad-luck bastard. 
 He starts off well enough as a nice guy with a talent for teaching and is in the early stages of what looks to be a very promising relationship with Sarah. However, a car accident leaves Johnny in a coma which nobody thinks he'll recover from. Miraculously, he wakes up 4 years later, but he finds that Sarah has married someone else, his mother has turned into a religious lunatic, he's got a long and painful rehab to endure, and he faces a mountain of debt from his hospital bills. Oh, and he now has psychic ability to learn details about a person by touching them or personal objects as well as sometimes seeing their futures. This might seem like a gift, but as Johnny quickly learns it's really a curse that eventually puts him on a collision course with a dangerous politician named Greg Stillson. 
 I've always thought this was one of King's better books but hadn't read it for years. A new audio version with James Franco narrating and doing a pretty good job of it got me motivated, and I'm pleased to find that it mostly lives up to my memory of it. 
 The elephant in the room on this one is that even though it was published in 1979 the Stillson plot is about a populist demagogue who manages to rise in politics despite being a crazy and corrupt piece of shit just because he has talent for making rubes think that he's a maverick who tells it like it is even as they willfully ignore the obvious warning signs. So it'd be easy to say that King is a prophet these days. Yeah, he hit the mark with that one, but on the other hand there's plenty of writers who have done stories about shady politicians. 
 What I found more interesting here is what King did with Johnny's mother, Vera. She starts out as someone with strong fundamental religious beliefs, but Johnny's accident sends her over the high side and into the realm where she starts believing tabloid stories about Jesus living underground at the South Pole. She's completely immune to facts and logic, and she'd rather rely on prayer than medication to handle her high blood pressure. 
 It's fascinating to read a character like this in the '70s setting where tabloids and poorly printed tracts are how Vera gets her crackpot theories, and how even then she uses them to create her own view of the world because reality doesn't suit her. Fast forward to the 21st century where some people pick their news web sites based on how it conforms to what they want to believe as they spread rumors on Facebook about child sex rings in the basement of pizza restaurants that don't even have a basement, and you realize that King had tapped into something that was on the rise even then. 
 Leaving aside the eerie similarities to America today, what sets this apart from his other novels is the way that King focused on John Smith and made his story a genuine tragedy. Johnny just wanting to try and resume some kind of normal life, but unable to stop himself from using his power to help people and put himself in a media spotlight is incredibly compelling. 
 Uncle Stevie takes his sweet time with this so that it comes across as more a slow burn, and it's not really a horror novel although it can be creepy at times. You can see where the bigger plot involving Johnny and Stillson is headed for a good long while although King still makes the journey there worth the trip, and Johnny is one of his characters who haunts me the most.",99.0,1,760,1512.4,1.99,148,2,4,3

To give birth to her ""chap,"" demon-mother Mia has usurped the body of Susannah Dean and used the power of Black Thirteen to transport to New York City in the summer of 1999. The city is strange to Susannah...and terrifying to the ""daughter of none,"" who shares her body and mind.

Eddie and Roland, meanwhile, tumble into western Maine in the summer of 1977, a world that should be idyllic but isn't. For one thing, it is real, and the bullets are flying. 
These are the simple vectors of a story rich in complexity and conflict. Its dual climaxes, one at the entrance to a deadly dining establishment and the other appended to the pages of a writer's journal, will leave readers gasping for the saga's final volume (which, Dear Reader, follows soon, say thank ya).",Fiction,Intermediate,10,1,14,8.0,9,3.98,87313,1.0,"I'm going to sit down and write reviews on the whole Dark Tower series after I finish, but I just have to say these books are becoming more and more tiresome. It just seems as if King has lost the vision of Roland the Gunslinger, so he - in order to have something to write about - constantly tinkers with the lore, changes history around, blames things on this multi-timestream concept, or spends whole novels describing an event merely to snap his fingers and change everything the next book so as to move his new plot line along. And the worst part of it all is that I've begun The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower and it appears to be in the same vein as the last two novels and not the great novels from earlier in the series. 
 To me, The Gunslinger, The Waste Lands and Wizard and Glass were epic works, because King seamlessly combined fantasy, post-apocalyptic, horror, and - dare I say it - western themes to create something fresh and grand. Reading one of those novels was like trying out a new dessert for the first time and savoring this delicious taste you had discovered. 
 On the other hand, The Drawing of the Three, Wolves of the Calla, and Song of Susannah read like contemporary, horror type novels, played out mainly in modern America rather than the addictive lands of Mid-World. It is just ho-hum fiction, nothing to set it apart from other books of that sort besides the title Dark Tower part whatever. 
 And if the gradual unraveling of a once great story wasn't progressing fast enough, Stephen King decides to do something that is just unthinkable to me: write himself into the story as a god-creator, almost a Rose Part Deux. 
 How could he have ever thought that was a good idea? 
 I honestly don't know, because it did nothing to actually make sense of the growing mess that is the Dark Tower series. Perhaps it will help shape the ending, but if so, I have just went todash and have witnessed the train wreck which will be the end of the Dark Tower series. 
 These are just my initial thoughts on Song of Susannah and the Dark Tower series as I begin reading the last book. No matter how annoyed I feel at this moment, I've made a commitment to finish the Dark Tower, so I will push forward, even though I cringe to think how bad the ending is going to be.",61.0,1,4239,12674.61,2.99,578,3,3,3

 ""Patty said no, Walter insisted, she insisted no, he insisted yes. Then she realized he didn't have a car and was offering to ride the bus with her, and she insisted no all over again, and he insisted yes"" 
 Sorry, what is this? Is this the Great American Novel? Are you kidding me? 
 ""She almost suggested to Walter that he had better kiss her first, if he was going to be asking her to live with him, but she was so offended that she didn't feel like being kissed at that moment."" 
 And if you are tired of this sugary girly revelations, you can get the more raw stuff when the perspective changes to Katz: 
 ""His dick was saying yes to something now, and this something was certainly not the wideish ass of the retreating jogger. Had death, in fact, been his dick's message in sending him to Washington? Had he simply misunderstood its prophecy?"" 
 You get the idea. 
 And don't even get me started on the fucked up chronology. It wasn't done in eloquent, mysterious way, it was done in a blabbermouth with ADHD way. It is like my friend Maciek, who tells me a story and in the middle of it he remembers some other story that might or might not be related to the story he is telling me so he tells me that other story, and then some other story that somehow came from the second story, and then maybe he will return to the main story and you end up wondering if the second story actually happened in the middle of the first story or it was just his way of telling a story. 
 The final moral from this book is that we are all fucked up in our own special way but it will all be alright unless, of course, we become Republicans, in which case there will be no redemption. 
 It almost killed me. This book almost killed me. But as they say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, therefore this book made stronger, so for that alone I had to give it two stars. 
 I will admit that Patty and Walter were both interesting characters with all the supporting cast being all sorts of caricatures and serving as props to the main duo. 
 Now, I am off to read a book about people who do things and have real problems. 
 *UPDATE - oh yeah. And I also forgot to say that if this book was written by a woman, it would be deemed chick lit and stuck in a pastel colour cover with birds and flowers. No one would even look at it twice because there is so much better chick lit out there. But as Jonathan Franzen is lucky enough to be a man, this, all of a sudden, is the Great American Novel. DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH. 
 If anyone else claims there is no sexism in literary/publishing world, this here is my best demonstrative evidence that there is. Honest to God, who would take this book seriously if it was written by a woman and had something pink on the cover?",71.0,1,860,6871.400000000001,7.99,128,2,3,2
1054,The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,1977,1977,"The Silmarillionis the central stock of J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative writing, a work that he could not publish in his lifetime because it grew with him. Its origins stretch back sixty years, long before The Hobbit,which was independently conceived but was caught up into what he called the ""branching acquisitive theme"" from which emerged The Lord of the Rings.
The Silmarillion,though published last and posthumously, has the primacy, both in terms of the author's life and in terms of its content. It is the story of the First Age in Tolkien's world, the ancient dramas to which characters in The Lord of the Ringslook back, and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part.
The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils; but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. The Silmarillionis the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeleess despite their heroism, against the great Enemy.
The book includes several other shorter works beside The Silmarillionproper. Preceding it are the Ainulindaleor Music of the Ainur, a myth of the Creation, and the Valaquenta,in which the nature and powers of each of the gods are set forth. After The Silmarillionis the Akallabeth,in which is recounted the downfall of the great island kingdom of Numenor at the end of the Second Age; and at the end is the tale Of the Rings of Power,in which the matter of the Lord of the Ringsis treated in the manner The Silmarillion.
The Silmarillionis not a romance, not a fairy tale, not a fictitious history contrived for its own sake. It is a work of unparalleled and sustained imagination, a sombre vision in the mode of myth and legend of the conflict between the desire to dominate the world and other wills and the creative power that proceeds from the development of inherent inner talents. The corruption of Feanor, the creator of supreme beauty, by the deceits of Morgoth and by his own possessive passion for the things of his own making, and the fruits of that corruption, is one of its central themes.
The Silmarillionhas been edited and prepared for publication from many manuscripts by the author's son, Christopher Tolkien.

Where do you even start? There's just so much story in here. Any attempt to convey it in a review would be to do the book a massive disservice. There would only ever be enough space to talk about one or a few elements of the work. 
 So instead I thought I'd give my reasoning as to why every Tolkien enthusiast needs to read this in order to fully understand Tolkien: the sheer depth of the work. 
 ""It is said by the Eldar that in water there lives yet the echo of the Music of the Ainur more than in any substance that is in this Earth; and many of the Children of Iluvatar hearken still unsated to the voices of the Sea, and yet know not for what they listen."" 
 The history of middle-earth is very rich, and it stretches a very long way. Much further than the time of Sauron and the Ring. And this sense of history is only very briefly glimpsed within The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit if at all. The Silmarillion is the entire picture; it is the entire vison of Tolkien's fantasy world. It's a huge piece of world building, and there really is nothing else quite like it. In here he relays a huge amount of history, a truly staggering amount for a fictional world to possess. 
 I often talk about the need for world building in fantasy, and here it is in full force. It's astonishing. It's beyond imaginative. It goes further than anything before it and since. And this is why Tolkien is the master of the genre. He wasn't the first, and he certainly won't be the last to write such fiction, but he was the best writer to ever attempt it. He more than set the benchmark when he wrote this. So if you're thinking about reading this, but find the task at hand a little bit too daunting, then stop thinking. Pick this book and lose yourself in the history of the greatest fantasy universe ever created. You won't regret it.",130.0,1,1292,6447.08,4.99,81,2,5,3
1055,The Silkworm,Robert Galbraith,2014,2015,"Private investigator Cormoran Strike returns in a new mystery from Robert Galbraith, author of the #1 international bestseller The Cuckoo's Calling.
When novelist Owen Quine goes missing, his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike. At first, Mrs. Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few days--as he has done before--and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home.
But as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine's disappearance than his wife realizes. The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous pen-portraits of almost everyone he knows. If the novel were to be published, it would ruin lives--meaning that there are a lot of people who might want him silenced.
When Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike any Strike has encountered before...

Luke finds him as he is a prodigy sculptor and buys him out of slavery giving him status once again as a free man. Luke had been searchig on behalf of Joseph of Arimithea who old and feeble as he is, is intent on securing the best and most talented artisan to design a chalice which will be made to fit the cup used by Jesus at The Last Supper"". Joseph has safeguarded the cup over the years as the Zealots are intent on destroying any remnants of Jesus and eradicating the entire Christian faith.

1057,Paradise Lost,J. A. Jance,2001,2003,"John Milton's Paradise Lost is one of the greatest epic poems in the English language. It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.
Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.
(P)2009 Tantor",Fiction,Intermediate,3,12,16,14.333333333333334,10,3.8,97784,5.0,"There's all this debate over why Satan is so appealing in Paradise Lost. Did Milton screw up? Is he being cynical, or a double-secret atheist? And why is God such a dick? 
 But no one asks whether, say, Shakespeare screwed up in making Iago so much fun; they just give him credit for writing an awesome villain. And that's all Milton's doing. Satan is tempting for us because Satan is tempting for us. That's the point of Satan! If Milton didn't make him as appealing as possible, he'd be doing Satan a disservice. And Eve, for that matter. 
 Similarly, God's a dick because God's a dick. You've read the Old Testament. He's not exactly all flowers and hugs there either. Again, Milton's just being true to his characters, and writing a great story while he's at it. 
 There's slightly more to it than that, yeah. For example: it's hinted a little that God sets Satan up to fall. He gives a stern warning that anyone who disobeys him or his son will be cast out of Heaven. But since there's no sin or evil at the time of his speech, why give the warning? Isn't that like saying ""Don't touch these cookies while I'm gone"" to a kid who didn't realize there were cookies until you pointed them out? 
 Here's my advice to people considering reading Paradise Lost: read the first two books. It starts with a bang, and it's pretty amazing for a while. It slows down a bit in books III - VII, so if you're not totally sold in the first two books (I was), you can either quit altogether with a fair idea of what Milton sounds like, or skip to books IX and X. IX is the actual temptation and fall (especially fun if you're a misogynist), and X is an astonishing sequence where Adam and Eve contemplate suicide: 
 ""Why am I mocked with death, and lengthened out 
 To deathless pain? How gladly would I meet 
 Mortality my sentence... 
 his dreadful voice no more 
 Would thunder in my ears."" (Adam, X.774 - 780) 
 ""We've totally mucked this up, and our kids are gonna justifiably hate us because we got kicked out of Paradise, and maybe we should just quit while we're behind."" 
 But really, the whole thing is worth it. Took me a while - it's intense stuff, so I found that I had to read a book and then chew on it for a while to process it before moving to the next one - but it's cool. 
 In book VIII, if you're cosmologically minded, Milton lays out the whole universe. Like Giordano Bruno, he understands that our earth is a tiny speck in the universe, and he gets that all the stars are suns like ours, and therefore could have planets like ours around them. He also thinks they might be inhabited; our species might not be God's only experiment. Elsewhere, other Adams and Eves may have faced the same test of the Tree of Knowledge - and they might have passed it. Isn't that an amazing thought? 
 In books XI and XII, Michael tells Adam sortof all the rest of the stories in the Old Testament, which of course boil down to: 
 ""So shall the world go on, 
 To good malignant, to bad men benign, 
 Under her own weight groaning."" (XII 537 - 539) 
 That's your fault there, Adam. Nice work. 
 He rushes through them though, and it makes me wonder whether Milton had originally intended to retell the entire Old Testament but got bored or intimidated or something. That would've been remarkable. Certainly Paradise Lost is better literature than the Old Testament is, and significantly more coherent. 
 It's also better literature than almost everything else. Second-best poem by a blind guy ever.",188.0,1,4698,23443.02,4.99,502,4,1,4

 --------------- 
 Edited 12/06 - Winner of GRCA for fiction!! I guess that even with the polarized reviews, readers overwhelmingly voted for it!! 
 ---------------- 
 First off -- the elephant in the room. Many readers didn't enjoy this book as much as others by the same author. I didn't think twice about rating it 4 stars - really enjoyed. 
 In considering my review, I noted many lower ratings and saw some disappointment expressed. One of the key themes (and I agree with !) is that patience is needed while reading. Yes, the story is about what happened at a barbecue to upset the lives of the 6 adults and 3 children involved. The story goes back and forth between ""before"" and ""after"" the barbecue and the reader is left hungry for details -- what did happen? The what happened unfolds painfully slowly. I tried to guess as I was reading and was not even in the ballpark. 
 Because patience isn't one of my virtues, I had to keep reading. I went so far as to be a bad Buddy Reader and not stick to the agreed schedule. Just had to keep reading to find out about the barbecue.... 
 Why I liked this book 
 I love reading stories with well-developed characters. Sometimes a book may have a great plot, but if I hate all of the characters - I may struggle with enjoying it. 
 This book had an interesting plot (if slow to develop) -- and unique, colorful characters. 
 The adults are very different people at very different places in life. Some of the tidbits that come up are fascinating -- hoarding, exotic dancing, cello playing, seeking fertility treatment, whiling away the hours at a job (instead of working).... Some of the characters are likeable -- others, not so much. I didn't completely connect with any of the characters, but found their backgrounds fascinating -- and told with humor. A crotchety neighbor was also intriguing to read about.... 
 "" Everyone had another sort of life up their sleeve that might have made them happy."" 
 I recommend 
 Truly Madly Guilty 
 to fans of Women's fiction -- especially readers of 
 Liane Moriarty

 Another one-star book for the ""so bad it pissed me off"" category. I so wanted to like this book. Up until this book I think I read nearly everything Crichton wrote. 
 Timeline, in my opinion, had a great premise. Swashbuckler disguised as Sci-Fi. The problem I had was that Crichton tried too hard to explain his premises, and ended up making a jumble that even he couldn't untangle. 
 This book was supposed to have all the good stuff: time travel, knights, castles, fighting, suspense. But the characters don't ever really make it off the page. The bad guys are so one-dimensional, they are hard to hate. Good book hate requires conflict, and the bad guys are just so unrelentingly bad. Same issue with the good guys, the ""good"" guys are so boring, they're hard to root for. In the end, I didn't really care if they made it back okay. 
 Speaking of the ending, it all seemed like it was just tacked on because some editor said: ""Okay, you have to wrap this up in the next 40 pages, or it won't make a good movie script!"" They're all in this inextricable mess, but suddenly the tide turns completely in their favor for the ""good guys"" who repair the device at the last second, make it running, send the bad guys back to die horribly, and the two sympathetic couples live happily ever after with babies? Ha! 
 ...which is another thing that pissed me off. It seemed like Crichton was writing this just because it had been too long since he wrote a book that would ""make a great movie!"" (Thought the movie kind of sucked too.) And sure enough, it got optioned. bah. Don't you remember the days of amazing novels by Crichton?

1062,The Constant Princess,Philippa Gregory,2005,2005,"""I am Catalina, Princess of Spain, daughter of the two greatest monarchs the world has ever known...and I will be Queen of England.""
Thus, bestselling author Philippa Gregory introduces one of her most unforgettable heroines: Katherine of Aragon. Daughter of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain, Katherine has been fated her whole life to marry Prince Arthur of England. When they meet and are married, the match becomes as passionate as it is politically expedient. The young lovers revel in each other's company and plan the England they will make together. But tragically, aged only fifteen, Arthur falls ill and extracts from his sixteen-year-old bride a deathbed promise to marry his brother, Henry; become Queen; and fulfill their dreams and her destiny.
""They tell me nothing but lies here and they think they can break my spirit. I believe what I choose and say nothing. I am not as simple as I seem.""
Widowed and alone in the avaricious world of the Tudor court, Katherine has to sidestep her father-in-law's desire for her and convince him, and an incredulous Europe, that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated, that there is no obstacle to marriage with Henry. For seven years, she endures the treachery of spies, the humiliation of poverty, and intense loneliness and despair while she waits for the inevitable moment when she will step into the role she has prepared for all her life. Then, like her warrior mother, Katherine must take to the battlefield and save England when its old enemies the Scots come over the border and there is no one to stand against them but the new Queen.
""It was my dying husband's hope, my mother's wish, and God's will that I should be Queen of England; and for them and for the country, I will be Queen of England until I die.""
Raised on the battlefield and in the most beautiful Moorish palace in the world, sent to England alone at the age of sixteen to take her place in a court where she couldn't speak the language, and abandoned and forced to endure poverty after the death of her husband, Katherine remained a woman of indomitable spirit, unwavering faith, and extraordinary strength.

On October 1, God is in His heaven, the stock market stands at 10,140, most of the planes are on time, and Clayton Riddell, an artist from Maine, is almost bouncing up Boylston Street in Boston. He's just landed a comic book deal that might finally enable him to support his family by making art instead of teaching it. He's already picked up a small (but expensive!) gift for his long-suffering wife, and he knows just what he will get for his boy Johnny. Why not a little treat for himself? Clay is feeling good about the future.
That changes in a hurry. The cause of the devastation is a phenomenon that will come to be known as The Pulse, and the delivery method is a cell phone. Everyone's cell phone. Clay and the few desperate survivors who join him suddenly find themselves in the pitch-black night of civilization's darkest age, surrounded by chaos, carnage, and a human horde that has been reduced to its basest nature...and then begins to evolve.
There is really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clay, an arrow points home to Maine, and as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north they begin to see crude signs confirming their direction. A promise, perhaps. Or a threat...

Not one to usually dislike a King novel, I did go into this one without the highest of expectations and ended up being very pleasantly surprised. 
 The story centers around a mass event that turns anyone who happens to be on their cell phone at the time into a zombie. Mass chaos ensues and a small group of survivors bands together and tries to figure out what is going on and how to stop it. Some of the plot-line does have some similarity to The Stand, but the characters are fairly unique, the dialog is good, and the action keeps rolling along at a fairly brisk pace. 
 I really liked this novel. I knew that I probably would, but it was a nice surprise that it was as good as it was.

Dante's synthesis of epic with lyric has bequeathed to modern artists and translators a permanent imperative to translate his art into contemporary, living speech. In this new translation of the Inferno, Elio Zappulla successfully re-creates the immediacy, directness, and psychological force of Dante's original text. Zappulla's faithfulness to Dante's Italian is matched by an executed commitment to convey to today's reader, through the lyrical cadences of everyday American English, the emotional and aesthetic impact of what he calls Dante's ""complex simplicity."" At the same time, the reader is never allowed to lose sight of the Inferno's intellectual majesty and moral grandeur.",Fiction,Intermediate,29,1,16,5.724137931034483,6,3.99,215,5.0,"I understand there is nothing new I can say about this classic. What I can do is offer my experience of reading Dante's opus, to hope that by writing the review much more will be revealed to me of my reading than I know here at the start. I imagine I will offer much speculation which has probably been speculated upon for eons. But for me speculation is at the heart of reading and of writing. There is no Virgil to guide me-us. On our own let's step into The Inferno. 
 Homage is due for this epic scripted within verse form. Nowhere was the work constrained, contained, by the form. Rather, the form bred the words and opened the visage of the work. I would have to call this feat...well, sorry... but Dantesque. Comparisons here are lacking. 
 The Inferno begins with Dante lost in the woods and coming to a fork in the path. Realizing he has strayed from what is meaningful in his life he acknowledges the appearance of the poet Virgil who encourages him to take the path guarded by a Leopard, a Lion, a She-Devil. Virgil pledges his protection as this path will initially lead to walking downward through the tiers of hell before the climb can take place where Dante may finally meet Beatrice. 
 During the travel through hell, a visitation of the sins of mankind and their punishments, Dante seems young or younger than my image of the icon, fearful and vulnerable. Understandably so in that the horrific crimes of the sinner often incur punishments well beyond gruesome. Many have crossed the blood line into the sadistic. I have a strong stomach for things like this but there were a number of situations, as hard as I tried, I could not identify with and experience the sinners continuing pain and torment. I hid behind the words, intellect. 
 Was this a firm and harrowing statement of Dante, the monstrous images embedded within the mind kindling a deep burnt scarring of fear, in order to herd those outside the faithful into the church's fold? 
 But here's where I had a problem. As I wandered with Virgil and Dante denial fell rapidly away leaving the gore and guts of tortures of punishment more hideous than the crimes of the sinners. Who was the architect of this horrendous regimen and why? What was Dante telling me here; the Dante as a character within the book, our narrator, and/or the Dante writing the book, our author? Is this a comment on how much greater is the power of the authorities and therefore the suffering that can be looked forward to if one steps outside of moral rectitude, and the balance owed to the State, the burly sack filled with conventions? I suppose this young(er) anxious Dante within the book was there to not only take me along on his precarious journey under the safe guidance of Virgil, but to point out in the most vivid stomach churning way how the church had grown too powerful with its fear mongering, the State with its continual wars, the lure, compulsion, to turn away from one's life. Virgil, the standard-bearer of reason, is taking Dante through the witnessing of these atrocities, what lies within humans, their hearts in hidden byways, in Dante's, so he can begin to regain his own life of meaning? 
 It is nothing new that all of us, including our young Dante, is capable of the full menu of atrocities. However, by locking this repulsive knowledge in the rust hinged chest of repression only leads to further and escalated expression. Virgil has led Dante down into the realm of his unconscious? There he witnesses his own devastating impulses and its consequent suffering? When they reach the end of hell they begin an ardous climb, Virgil always leading the way, toward a light above.

BookPage calls Nicholas Sparks, ""a modern master of fateful love stories,"" and his phenomenal bestsellers- The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, and A Walk to Remember- have made him one of America's most beloved storytellers. Here, in his newest work, Sparks tells a story about making the greatest commitment of all...loving someone forever.
The Rescue
When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks - risks no one else in the department would ever take - to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate.
Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone.
During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love.
In The Rescue Nicholas Sparks weaves his inimitable spell, immersing us in the passions and the surprising complexities of modern relationships-and in doing so, teaching us something about our own.",Fiction,Intermediate,14,1,14,8.071428571428571,12,4.1,143722,5.0,"Opening Line: ""Why had this happened? Why, of all the children was Kyle the one?"" 
 I first read THE RESCUE in 2002 and enjoyed it just as much this time with it's rediscovery. As soon as I opened the first page I was lost, reading continuously for the next 24 hours. Thinking to myself, damn that Nicholas Sparks' he's done it again, sucking me right back into one of the best love stories I've ever read. 
 Due to a horrific childhood trauma volunteer firefighter Taylor McAden is driven to take disturbing heroic risks while on the job, trying to somehow put his world right. He has few friends and all of his past relationships have resulted from rescuing troubled women in one way or another. All of whom he inevitably leaves as soon as they want more from him then he can give. It seems that there's just one leap Taylor can't make; that of allowing himself to fall in love. 
 Denise Holden is a single mother of a handicapped child. Due to a lack of finances she has been forced to move back to her mother's hometown and live in the inherited home. At the moment she's barely scraping by, her son Kyle taking up most of her time, energy and resources. Love is the last thing on Denise's mind as she drives home from her job at the local diner. As fate would have it though a terrible storm hit's the small southern town that night, contriving to bring our couple together. As the storm rages Denise crashes her car and upon regaining consciousness finds herself staring into the handsome face of risk taker extraordinaire Taylor. Before she can acknowledge him as her potential life partner though panic takes over as she realizes that her son is no longer in the car and is feared to be lost in the nearby swamp. 
 I won't be giving anything away by telling you that Taylor rescues both Denise and her son and together they forge into a relationship. But as wonderful as the relationship seems in the beginning it doesn't take long for the cracks to show and the harder Denise tries to help Taylor the more he pulls away. Shutting down emotionally and taking greater and greater risks with the fire department(For a small town they sure have a lot of fires.) 
 As with every Nicholas Sparks' novel we are never guaranteed a HEA which aids in a degree of tension throughout this story. For me the relationship and its sudden decline is so well written that it seemed a page from my own past, tugging at my heart with its familiarity. Taylor is a mystery throughout and the whys of this aren't revealed until the very end. THE RESCUE contains some fabulous secondary characters and you will fall in love with every one of them. It's also full of action, suspense and melodrama. There were a couple of moments when I actually gasped out loud, unbelieving as to what I'd just read. Have some Kleenex handy, this is great yet as always with Sparks bittersweet love story. Cheers!",23.0,1,2866,8569.34,2.99,22,3,3,3

Then, in a moment of carelessness, Billy sideswipes an old gypsy woman as she is crossing the street--and her ancient father passes a bizarre and terrible judgement on him.
""Thinner,"" the old gypsy man whispers, and caresses his cheek, like a lover. Just one word...but six weeks later and ninety-three pounds lighter, Billy Halleck is more than worried. He's terrified. And desperate enough for one last gamble...that will lead him to a nightmare showdown with the forces of evil melting his flesh away. And away. And away...",Fiction,Intermediate,25,1,15,6.8,3,3.67,934,3.0,"And I thought the Atkins Diet sounded unhealthy... 
 William Halleck is a successful lawyer living in upper middle class splendor in a Connecticut suburb with his wife and daughter, and his biggest problem is that he's overweight. His perfect life is upset when he accidently run over an old Gypsy woman when he was *ahem* distracted behind the wheel. Since Billy is one of the solid taxpayers who plays golf with all the right people the whole mess is quickly tidied up in court without him getting so much as a ticket. However, another old Gypsy puts a whammy on him and suddenly Billy can't keep weight on no matter how much he eats. As he becomes a shadow of his former self Billy sets out on a desperate quest to track down the Gypsy and try to convince him to lift the curse of growing thinner. 
 This was the last of the novels Stephen King released under the pen name of Richard Bachman before his cover was blown shortly after its publication. (In fact, he gets cute by having a couple of characters describe the situation as sounding like a King novel.) As with the other Bachman books it seems like Uncle Stevie ran leaner and meaner in this one. He keeps the story focused tightly on its key concept, but he's also delivering some nice subtext about American culture. We've got a nicely ironic curse of a man's thoughtless greedy consumption being turned back on him as well as exploring the hypocritical way that the decent folk of New England will have their fun with the Gypsies and then run them out of town. 
 One of the strongest points here is in Halleck as a character. Billy seems like a decent guy who genuinely feels guilty about the death he inadvertently caused, and he's got the brains and courage to face up to the bizarre situation and act to save himself. However, he also went along with sweeping the whole mess under the rug, and he's willing to turn to a dangerous friend when he's really in trouble. So there's a nice mix in him that he's both somewhat willing to take responsibility even as he trying to wriggle out of the consequences of it. 
 It's a very solid piece of horror fiction that makes me wish that King would have gotten to do more Bachman books before the secret leaked out. He has published others under the name, but none were ever quite as good as the early ones.",100.0,1,555,1659.45,2.99,189,2,4,1

Publishers Weekly,Fiction,Intermediate,10,5,10,8.2,10,4.12,107,5.0,"Voyage reads like Whitman and Melville in a drinking contest, recognizing the attraction and dangers of the sea, the highs and lows that come with living on your own terms. Hayden had lived most of his life on a boat. When he lived in France, he lived on a boat in various docks. His love for the sea began at Long Wharf in Boston and Sausalito is where Hayden set his last anchor. NY-born and patrician Bogart had a schooner named Santana, and Hayden had his schooner Wanderer. There is no doubt that Hayden was a flawed man of Lear contradictions: he drank, railed against many things, but it seemed that he distrusted the things that came easy to him...such as acting. He disliked the Hollywood factories for creating illusion; politicians, for perpetuating other illusions and; railed against what he was seeing America become. He was outspoken about his political activism, his drinking and occasional drug use in his interviews with Tom Synder, where he looks like the future Keith Richards, but betrays himself as a writer. Hayden lived his life at odds with the `American dream,' climbing up and down the ladder of success several times over. He was a nonconformist who believed in the examined life. It is impossible not to notice the pattern that just as he was about to touch the brass ring he would walk away; but in the writing he is simply majestic, poetic, and provocative. I'd argue that his prose rivals with the best of the twentieth century's best writers.",4.0,1,2733,8171.670000000001,2.99,24,3,3,3

 THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS 
 It was kinda hard to decide the rating on this novel. 
 If I'd think only on the raw reading experience, I would say that it was a 3-star material. 
 However, I had to ponder about the whole additional info and further development of characters compared with my experience with the film adaptation (which certainly is one of my favorite horror films). So, I think that the fairest rating is giving a solid 4-star rating. 
 Certainly due all those deeper details in the original book, I think that novel & movie make an irresistible combo to do. 
 You watched the film, and then you'll appreciate even more the extended information that you'll find in the original novel, but in matters of frightening, well the movie has a clear advantage, but don't dismiss the novel so quickly. 
 Since, may be not the best horror novel that I've ever read,... 
 ...but certainly the book has... 
 ...something to compel you to read it, and have it a huge respect to it. 
 MOVIE V. BOOK: DAWN OF POSSESSION 
 I am not surprised if almost any reader has watched the film before reading the novel.. 
 ...And my case wasn't any different. 
 I have watched the three film versions: Original theatrical, ""The Never-Before-Seen"" version and the ""Extended Director's Cut"". Any comment that I'd make in this review about the film adaptation it will be based on the latest mentioned version, the ""Extended Director's Cut"", due it's the most complete and also it's the one that I have on Blu-ray so it's the one that I have more fresh on my mind. 
 It's interesting how the film is generally accepted as the most terrifying movie of all time, while the novel doesn't keep that distinction. Actually the debate about which novel is the most terrifying of all, it's an endless dispute that I'm sure the general reading community never would be able to agree in a specific novel. 
 While the imagination is the best special effects generator, I have to admit that it wasn't so shocking to read scenes than in the visual presentation where they are truly scary. 
 Even, I don't know if there was the choice of words used in the narrative of the book, since I think that I'd some ""technical"" difficulties to visualize some of those scenes, if I wouldn't have previous notion of how they supposed to look like, thanks to the film. 
 PLAYING DEVIL'S ADVOCATE 
 So, I am still glad of having read the original novel, since not matter the film adaptation covered the most important elements of the general storyline;... 
 ...the novel indeed gives you enlighting info about the background of the characters, even ""new"" characters that didn't appear on the movie version, and deeper development of many of the scenes. 
 On the film, you never have doubt that there is a demon inside of Regan,... 
 ...but in the novel, there are plausible scenarios causing suspicions on other characters, with the chance of a more rational explanation. 
 So, not so ironically, in the same way that you have faith to believe in God, well, the story requires of you to have ""faith"" to believe in the existence of The Devil. 
 That, it's something so curious about many priests in Catholic Church, that I understand that there must be an investigation to discard a simpler explanation to some situations, but it seems that if you say that you're possessed by The Devil or to the contrary, you were witness of the word of God, in any case, the priests will see you as a perfect nut job to send to some psychiatric asylum. 
 So, while the priests are supposed to believe in God, it's like they don't want to believe in the existence of The Devil, that's it's quite odd, since they are both sides of the same religious coin. 
 Also, some elements in the novel, that you may perceive as ""random"" in the film version, even not clarify enough for really understanding why they are in the story, those elements are well developed on the novel and even making ties to the demon inside Regan that you may didn't think about before. 
 Moreover, some reactions and conducts of the characters, knowing key info about their pasts, you can rationalize better why they are reacting in such ways. 
 Even some conversations, they are the same in terms of dialogue, but the mood of them are perceived in a different way in the book, giving some new angles to the dynamics between characters. 
 SPEAKING OF THE DEVIL 
 That's exactly what I expect when I decide to read a book (original novel or novelization) when I already watched the film adaptation. 
 Since while I invest only two hours to watch the movie, I can invest like a week (or more) to read a novel. So, if I read just the exact story on the book, I think that it would kinda pointless, but if I got enough additional info,... 
 ...certainly then, it was well invested time. 
 I think that the most effective element on the construction of the story is that you get a lot of arguments and plausible explanations of what it's going on, so in some reverse psychology gimmick, you get to believe more and more that Regan is indeed possessed by a demon. 
 While in some other novels where they approach the paranormal angle directly, the reader tends to accept it without a doubt. 
 Maybe you don't believe in The Devil or in God even, but don't worry,... 
 ...since you also can say that you don't believe in Jupiter (the planet, not the Roman god) and that doesn't make that that planet isn't out there. 
 Many people are atheists until they have to face a demon by themselves. 
 And it's not like that I am saying that you have to believe in the Christian God, since while I am Catholic, my wish is only that all people believe in some higher power, that you may name whatever you prefer, but believe, in something higher than us. 
 Since some others may call as unrealistic, to believe in gods or higher powers,... 
 ...for me, not believing in some higher power, I'd call it as sad. 
 Believe in God. Beware of The Devil. Both are real, not matter if you believe in them or not. 
 Getting back to the book, I recommend the novel for any fan of the film and wishing to get a deeper developement on the story.

1075,The Wedding,Nicholas Sparks,2003,2013,"It's a classic plot: a marriage of convenience that lays the groundwork for true love.
1119. Journeying from England to Scotland to wed a highlander, Lady Brenna had resigned herself to the arranged match. But when a band of fierce, painted warriors captured her en route, she fearlessly met their demand to marry their leader -- the quick-tempered laird Connor MacAlister. She couldn't know that her capture was merely the first act of vengeance against her betrothed, Connor's sworn enemy.
Brenna harbored no illusions that her husband was in love with her; after a hasty forest wedding, MacAlister assured her she could return home once she had borne him a son. But she could not deny that she had once proposed to MacAlister -- ten years ago, when she was just a child, and the visitor to her father's castle charmed her with his dazzling, unexpected smile.

Luminous, haunting, unforgettable, The Age of Miraclesis a stunning fiction debut by a superb new writer, a story about coming of age during extraordinary times, about people going on with their lives in an era of profound uncertainty.
On a seemingly ordinary Saturday in a California suburb, 11-year-old Julia and her family awake to discover, along with the rest of the world, that the rotation of the earth has suddenly begun to slow. The days and nights grow longer and longer, gravity is affected, the environment is thrown into disarray. Yet as she struggles to navigate an ever-shifting landscape, Julia is also coping with the normal disasters of everyday life--the fissures in her parents' marriage, the loss of old friends, the hopeful anguish of first love, the bizarre behavior of her grandfather who, convinced of a government conspiracy, spends his days obsessively cataloging his possessions. As Julia adjusts to the new normal, the slowing inexorably continues.
With spare, graceful prose and the emotional wisdom of a born storyteller, Karen Thompson Walker has created a singular narrator in Julia, a resilient and insightful young girl, and a moving portrait of family life set against the backdrop of an utterly altered world.",Fiction,Intermediate,2,6,10,8.0,1,3.64,61891,5.0,"I loved this book. I read it in one 24 hour period. Great example of soft sci-fi/fabulist fiction. It's like a cross between Alice Sebold's book The Lovely Bones and Lars Van Trier's film Melancholia. In some ways, I also thought about Diary of Anne Frank. A young girl faces a possible apocalypse in MIRACLES. It's YA dystopia but more charming and whimsical than, say, The Hunger Games. Ultimately it is a book that celebrates life with one hand, as it erases life with the other. 
 The language of the book is poetic and intoxicating. The consequences of the slowing earth are imagined in rich and provocative detail. 
 SPOILER ALERT. 
 I did think the author cheated just a bit here and there. It's a brilliant cheat. There are times the hero Julia says things like: ""That was the last time I EVER ate strawberries."" Or I NEVER saw so and so again. That kind of language hints that she might die at the end, or that the world ends in the last chapter. In fact, the character and the world still go on by the novel's end, albeit precariously. I think the more honest phrasing would have been: ""That was the last time I ate strawberries this spring."" Because as long as the earth spins and she is alive, she can't truly know that she will NEVER eat strawberries again. Even if strawberries become extinct, technically she can not know that by some twist of fate she won't eat them again. 
 It's a small thing and I think the author was very clever to use this sleight of hand. It made me think that the girl or the world were going away. It's a book I will think of for some time. As a writer myself of speculative, trippy fiction -- I am in the process of analyzing the many things this book did right!

 This book ended up being just okay for me. Based on the description, I thought that this was going to be a completely different book than it turned out to be. If you are a reader that does not enjoy any kind of paranormal or out of the ordinary in a story, you will want to avoid this one. I do like those things so it wasn't a deal breaker for me although it was unexpected. 
 I thought that the story moved rather slowly at times and it was never the kind of book that I found hard to put down. That being said I did want to know how everything would work out. I really had expected this book to fall nicely into the mystery category but I found that it was really more focused on the characters. There was some mystery to be found but the focus was different than I had expected. 
 I never connected with any of the characters. Carrie seemed too controlled and distant. As the book progressed, I found that I never really felt anything towards Carrie. Her backstory was interesting but it never sparked any kind of emotion from me. This is a story where bad things happen to a tiny boy and I didn't any kind of emotional reaction. Carrie's husband was even more distant and he was very controlling. I really didn't connect with him at all and his behavior actually made me question Carrie more since she didn't see any problems with it. 
 It was a story that took some big risks and unusual turns. The story unfolded in a manner that made me want to see it to completion. I wanted to know everyone's secrets and see their reactions even if I didn't feel any connection to the characters. I liked the idea behind the story but had problems with the characters and pacing of the story. I also thought the ending of the book was rather lackluster and had hoped for something a little more meaningful. 
 I do think that some readers will really enjoy this book. This is the first book by Kelly Simmons that I have read and I would be willing to read more of her work in the future. 
 I received an advance reader edition of this book from Sourcebooks Landmark via NetGalley for the purpose of providing an honest review.

Most of you have the seen the picture of my gutted hardcover copy of Insomnia. If you haven't I'll include it at the end of this post as well. Total loss of containment, folks. About thirty pages loosed themselves from the glue and became individual souls. I have a 284 page section, and another section of about 400 pages, and a little bit in the middle that just said ""Fuck it"" and struck out for the territories. All in all, a sad day. Luckily, I have another one. Same edition. Same year. All's good. Oh, and a quick warning to owners of first edition Insomnias, the glue the printing press used back in 1994 is faulty. This separation is a common problem with this edition of the book. Keep your copy on a shelf. Do not touch. This has been a public service announcement brought to you in part by the letter E. 
 Actual Review: Insomnia is a difficult book to review without spoilers. Hell, the publisher didn't even know what to do with the cover of this one so they just put King's name on the front along with the title in alternating red and white. It's even a difficult novel to categorize. I guess it's horror. Maybe it's speculative fiction... or perhaps lit fic... or maybe bizarro... Fuck if I know, dude. I will say this much, it's a fun ride. 
 The only problem with this book is the requirement that you must have read the Dark Tower series to fully understand some of the plot. I mean, you can get through it without such knowledge, but it's a bit confusing in places if you don't have said knowledge. Roland Deschain is mentioned three times in this book. I tried to look at these sections as an outsider, as someone who has not read the DT books even though I have (numerous times), and I feel comfortable saying that the sections which mention Roland and the Tower would make zero sense to someone who is new to the King-verse. There is no context, nothing to draw off of. In fact, there is a paragraph toward the end of the book that says: ""Worlds which had trembled in their orbits now steadied, and in one of those worlds, in a desert that was the apotheosis of all deserts, a man named Roland turned over in his bedroll and slept easily once again beneath the alien constellations."" Imagine, if you will, that you've never read a Dark Tower novel (or, shit, maybe you haven't) and you just happened to pick up Insomnia because your buddy said, ""Yo, kid, peep this thick-ass book. Looks legit good, right? I mean, who the fuck doesn't love 800 pages cloaked in a sexy-as-fuck red and white jacket!?!?!?!?"" If you're that ""kid"", that Roland fucker means absolutely nothing to you. It seems pointless. Sad panda. 
 But for me? Son, I live for that shit. I love the DT references, all of them. I dig that shit in my heart of hearts. I'm the asshole in the coffee shop that won't shut up with the ""Yeah, but did you catch this bit?"" comments. I know, I know, I hate me too, but it's the truth. As far as I am aware there is no other author who has created a vaster universe, one that crosses every genre line in the business. King has written it all, and everything he writes puzzle-pieces back together in some way. Dig it, man. Or, you know, don't dig it. But I'm still going to nerd out whenever I stumble across the Beam. 
 Yes, this book is a little longwinded in spots, but what King book isn't? (Dolores Claiborne) Yes, it references the Dark Tower, but what King novel doesn't? (Mr. Mercedes ... seriously, so far it's the only novel of his that doesn't reference Mid-World in some way.) But it's also one of his most imaginative stories. I kinda feel that Insomnia is an 800-page wink-and-nod to the King-verse fans out there. Shit, dudettes, even the shoe Gage loses in Pet Semetery is in this book, not to mention entire ass-loads of It, Derry, and Pennywise references. Does all this bog down the story? No. Are there going to be parts you don't understand if you haven't read Roland's quest or trip-trapped through the story of The Loser's Club? Yes. Does any of this detract from the fun of this book? Nope. Not in the least. There is a well-plotted, expertly-honed story under all the referencing and fan service. This is King doing what King does best. Entertaining the people who bought tickets to see him in concert. 
 I will be skipping my normal Hidden Gems and Obvious Tie-Ins sections because I'm saving them for my A Decade with King: 1985-1994 post, which will be out April 1, 2015. There's a lot this time around, and I don't wanna type it twice. But I will leave you with this food for thought: 
 Spoilers for several King books. Click ""view spoiler"" at your own risk: Are the likes of Abra Stone and Dan Torrance and Johnny Smith on the same level of the tower that Ralph and Lois visit in Insomnia? Does Danny help people die in Doctor Sleep by allowing their aura to pass into him? (I just got goosebumps. You didn't need to know that, but that's how hard I fanboy.) 
 In summation: A King novel for King fans. I don't suggest anyone start with Insomnia, but I recommend it to all fans of the Dark Tower series and It. A mashup of everything fans love and hate about King rolled up in a Derry burrito and seasoned with Mid-World.

Anna is afraid of him until she realizes that he is caring for his six-year-old sister on his own.

Abel is in real danger of losing Micha to their abusive father and to his own inability to make ends meet. Anna gradually falls in love with Abel, but when his enemies begin to turn up dead, she fears she has fallen for a murderer. Has she?

 Abel Tannatek is the storyteller. He is a young man hiding an ugly reality behind pretty words and magical happenings. 
 In order to find out what he is hiding, we are forced to slowly watch as the layers of his true self are revealed, one ugly layer at a time. Secrets are the only method of survival in a world where you can count on no one but yourself. Secrets are the only choice you have when you must protect the life of an innocent. 
 Enter Anna. Sheltered, clueless Anna. She has no idea of the darkness and danger outside of her safe little world. 
 It's late, Anna...they'll be waiting for you, at home...in that house where the air is always blue...they'll be worried. 
 A chance meeting between the school's drug dealer and an innocent, sheltered student came about because of a lost doll. Had Anna not found the doll, she would have carried on her life as usual. There would be no danger, no mystery, no killing for her to know about. One might say that finding the doll was the worst thing that could have happened to her. I would disagree. 
 Abel is a broken human being. He's broken to the point of ill repair, yet Anna still sees something in him that's worth saving. As we see Abel through Anna's eyes, we are shown just how much a person will endure in order to spare a life so precious to him - the life of a tiny little girl in a pink jacket. 
 Abel and Anna bond through time shared as Abel spins wonderful fairytales into existence for his younger sister. Real life becomes the backdrop for the fantasy. Characters in reality become characters in the story. A mystery starts to unfold as characters in the story become bigger players in crimes which start taking place in the real world. Who is the killer? Why does Abel seem to have so much to hide? Why are other people interested in what Abel and Anna are up to?

 As for the character flaws...I suppose I should address those. Both Abel and Anna disappointed me in a way because of their actions, yet I felt as if their actions made them more real. Abel was abused, so he had no other experience to draw from in learning how to interact with others. Anna had an empty but satisfactory life and she craved more than her own existence inside of a pretty box. Abel was able to give her something she'd never had before and because of this, she was quick to forgive at times when others wouldn't.

She's a TV writer, and something's come up on her show; she has to stay in Los Angeles. She knows that Neal will be upset with her -- Neal is always a little upset with Georgie -- but she doesn't expect him to pack up the kids and go home without her.
When her husband and the kids leave for the airport, Georgie wonders if she's finally done it. If she's ruined everything.
That night, Georgie discovers a way to communicate with Neal in the past. It's not time travel, not exactly, but she feels like she's been given an opportunity to fix her marriage before it starts...
Is that what she's supposed to do?

How many different ways are there to say THIS WAS SO GOOD. HER WORDS ARE SO GOOD. HER CHARACTERS SO GOOD. EVERYTHING GOOD. RELATE SO MUCH. HELP. 
 That's pretty much all I feel like saying, because even over a month later, my feelings about this book are so jumbly wumbly it's hard to get them to sit still long enough to make them cohesive enough to write about. 
 Granted, having never been married and never had a serious vocation like our main character Georgie McCool does, I don't relate quite as much to this book as I have in her previous efforts (Fangirl and Attachments in particular). But there's just something about the way Rainbow Rowell writes about emotions that makes me instantly think YES I RECOGNIZE THAT. It's like her books are the story versions of falling in love or making an instant connection with a person. Like, those rare instances where you meet someone and you just instantly KNOW them. I've only had that happen a couple of times in my life, which is probably part of why I love reading her so much. 
 Just completely disregard the silly sounding plot with the time traveling phone. It's not important. It's just another way to explore the dynamics between people we care about, and how relationships can change and evolve, how we lose and find each other over and over again, how we have to commit to the relationships that are important to us. (Although, honestly, I think that kind of silly shit is incredibly cool.) 
 Definitely glad I own this in hardcover, and I'm sure I will be revisiting it over and over in years to come, just like I plan to do with all her other books. 
 Rainbow Rowell, why can't I quit you!?!? (Also, please don't stop writing these wonderful books. Please don't ever stop.) 
 Updated July 30, 2014: GUH. WHY IS SHE SO GOOD AT WRITING BOOKS I LOVE. Full review later. 
 June 2013: This doesn't sound like something I would necessarily pick up on my own, but I will read anything Rainbow Rowell writes, regardless of topic or genre. The list of authors I will do that for is not very large. I have lots of favorite books by authors I like, books I would probably stab people over (not really, just metaphorical stabbing), but a lot of those authors have also written books I will never read. But these authors? I love them and their words so much I don't even care. It goes like this: Rowling, Gaiman, Dahl, Sanderson, Green, Rothfuss, Rowell. That?

Years later, one of them, Andy McGee, is on the run from The Shop, with his daughter, Charlie. Can Andy and Charlie evade The Shop before their world goes up in flames? 
 First off, for years now, I cannot read the title without hearing the Prodigy song of the same name. Maybe he'll follow this one up with a book called Fuel my Fire or Smack My Bitch Up one of these days to continue along the same lines. 
 Firestarter is one of those Stephen King books you don't hear all that much about. A lot of people only know of it because of the movie starring Drew Barrymore in the 1980s. Well, more people should know about it because it's a corking good read. 
 A 1960s experiment gave Andy McGee and his wife psychic powers. It also altered their DNA enough to produce Charlie, their immensely powerful psychic daughter, whose abilities include pyrokinesis, hence the title. 
 For a good portion of the book, the suspense comes from Andy trying to stay one step ahead of The Shop. The rest of it is the two McGees trying to escape The Shop's clutches. The Shop, and John Rainbird, make fantastic villains because they aren't nearly as far outside the realm of possibility as evil cars and spider-clowns. 
 Like a lot of Stephen King books, the relationships between the characters keep the story going. John Rainbird proved to be more than the scene-chewing villain I originally pegged him as. Unlike the protagonists in Doctor Sleep, I feared for Charlie and Andy almost constantly. 
 I'd forgotten how brutal King was sometimes in his older books. There are some parts of this one I'll remember for a long time. Maybe Stephen King will revisit a character or two from this book before he goes to the clearing at the end of the path, maybe as part of a Dark Tower story.

 Review at Of Pens and Pages. 
 This group of teenagers infuriated me to no end, Livvy and Ryan the most, but I couldn't stop reading about them. Is this the last book for Amanda Walters and Jordan Tuttle? I think they were the most decent of the bunch, and I was sweet on them and their relationship. 
 Forever follows More Than Friends after Amanda and Tuttle broke up. As Amanda tries to move on, Tuttle realizes he'll do something to make him happy, and that's having her beside him. He has to prove himself that he's 100% sure of what he wants, and will be in this with Amanda. He'll try. 
 Tuttle is as sweet as he was in More than Friends, and even sweeter now since he doesn't want to ruin his second chance with Amanda. He's still hot and raunchy, but ahhhh his affectionate actions made me swoon. I'll definitely cuddle with Tuttle. Such a sweet man. 
 Amanda is still the most logical of the girls, but she gives in to Tuttle too fast. I would have wanted a bit more resistance and some groveling. 
 The angst is focused on Tuttle and Amanda's will they or won't they issue. Will Tuttle finally open up to Amanda? Will Amanda give him chance after chance? 
 If Livvy improved in book two, she pretty much jumped back to how she was in book one. Amanda tried to help her do what's right, but Livvy couldn't be controlled. Girl's gotta do what she wants to do. 
 I'm surprised at how quick I finished this book. I would have wanted to see more of Tuttle's growth since there was a lot of time skips. It made it seem the conflict easily resolved. I believe there are still a few loose ends in the Friends series, so I'm hoping there will be more. This book pretty much breezed by the last few months of their senior year. What happened to Livvy, Dustin, Ryan, Em, and Cannon? How about Kyla? 
 I know Amanda and Tuttle have reached their HFN, but I want to read more about them! I'd read about their college life for sure. A spin-off maybe? But if this is the end of their story, it was a pretty satisfying one for sure. I'm going to miss them! 
 Forever is the third installment in the Friends series, told in Amanda and Tuttle's POVs. It has teenage angst, brooding jocks and smart girls, and a*hole jocks and not-so-wise girls. Such is the life of high school. Full of boys, drama, and everything else in between.

1093,The Round House,Louise Erdrich,2012,2012,"An exquisitely told story of a boy on the cusp of manhood who seeks justice and understanding in the wake of a terrible crime that upends and forever transforms his family.
One of the most revered novelists of our time - a brilliant chronicler of Native-American life - Louise Erdrich returns to the territory of her bestselling, Pulitzer Prize finalist The Plague of Doves with The Round House, transporting readers to the Ojibwe reservation in North Dakota. It is an exquisitely told story of a boy on the cusp of manhood who seeks justice and understanding in the wake of a terrible crime that upends and forever transforms his family.
Riveting and suspenseful, arguably the most accessible novel to date from the creator of Love Medicine, The Beet Queen, and The Bingo Palace, Erdrich's The Round House is a page-turning masterpiece of literary fiction - at once a powerful coming-of-age story, a mystery, and a tender, moving novel of family, history, and culture.",Fiction,Intermediate,12,12,16,14.25,14,3.91,69142,5.0,"The Round House is a knockout of a book. 
 Louise Erdrich is one of the true deities in America's literary Olympus. With The Round House she has used her mythic creative powers to give us a book that can be read as a page-turner about a terrible crime, the attempt to identify the criminal and take action, or as a rich, layered look at a culture in a place and time, and a lad coming of age within it, the tale imbued with telling details, a colorful palette of imagery and cultural significance. Or best of all, both. 
 The story opens with a father and son trying to remove invasive tree roots from the foundation of their home. This being Erdrich, you can figure that roots of one sort and another will figure in the story. Antone Bazil Coutts, known as Joe, is thirteen years old. His father, also Antone Bazil, is a judge with great reverence for the law. When Joe's mother, Geraldine Coutts, is brutally beaten and raped she retreats into the security of solitude, not only to allow herself time to heal, but to try to protect her family, and others as well. The thrust of the story is the puzzle of who and why. Erdrich drops clues along the way like a seasoned writer of detective fiction. 
 How we understand the world is informed by the stories we are told, the culture in which we are raised. Christians are raised on stories of magical abundance from a few loaves and fishes, reincarnation, angels, a sometimes communicative if often cranky, creator. A colorful local priest offers Christian teaching. Many of the Ojibwe we meet here have friends or relations who are believers. 
 The Ojibwe have their legends too. Erdrich shows this by imbuing her tale with magical realism. Native lore is both told in stories and shown as living reality. This is a world in which the shadow of a passing crane becomes an angel on a bedroom wall, a world in which a twin feels the presence of a doppelganger, of her separated other, and in which the evil spirit, a wendiigoo, in a dark man seeks to devour the spirits of others. Ghosts figure in the story. Joe sees one. His father reports having seen ghosts as well. Mooshum, Joe's beloved grandfather, explains something about ghosts to Joe. Other characters as well report seeing ghosts or having their own other-worldly experiences. We see the Ojibwe affiliating with and being protected by various animals. Joe seeks guidance by visiting his clan totem, herons. Another tale is told of an Ojibwe being saved by a turtle. And an old bison communicates with one young brave in a legend. In addition family names include Larks and Coutts, and a town physician is Doctor Egge. I won't ask which came first. 
 We see the events in Hoopdance, North Dakota, through Joe's eyes. Joe has a group of pals, most importantly his studly bff, Cappy. They see things through a more contemporary lens, Star Trek: The New Generation (TNG), the series having begun less than a year prior. The boys' use of TNG stories, lore in this context, offers them meaningful language with which to define elements of their world. Of particular interest is the episode called 
 Skin of Evil 
 . Don't check it out until you are reading the book. The relevance will be immediately obvious. The boys' banter and relationships give the feel of a Stephen King story, one of those in which he particularly shines at portraying young people. Together with Native beliefs and Christian teaching, we have an unusual trinity of primary interpretive influences. 
 What is the Round House? We learn it's history and generation from Mooshum. It is a meeting place and is supposed to be a safe haven, a building the Ojibwe, one in particular, were told to construct by a spirit. Religious ceremonies, among other events, take place there. And yet it has been violated, just as tree roots attempted to insert themselves in the foundation of Joe's house. We learn the story of the building's genesis, see it in benign contemporary use, and see it again, under less than benign circumstances. It is also situated in a location near where sundry jurisdictions intersect, Ojibwe, state, federal, the perplexity of which figures in the tale. 
 There is a cornucopia of riches in Erdrich's construction. Joe's father's respect for the law is almost religious, and is mirrored by the knowledge of and contempt for the law expressed by the baddie. Native lore is compared to that of classic Greece. There are plentiful references made here that inform the story. Classics like the Iliad, Shakespeare, Plato and more recently, Dune, which resonates, with a young man taking on adult responsibilities. Bazil refers to his Handbook of Federal Indian Law as his bible. This compares with the priest and his actual Bible and Mooshum, Joe's grandfather, with his oral history and tribal spiritual beliefs. Is Bazil's belief in the law any more magical than Father Travis's belief in an eternal creator? Is Father Travis's belief in a resurrected savior any more out there than believing that one can communicate with an elderly bison? 
 Clothing is used to great effect as well. When one key character is in the hospital, two relations don his clothing as a way of feeling close to him. A woman with a dicey past is shown to full effect by the costume she dons. After an infection of the spirit, a woman says that some Ojibwe women ""dressed me in a new ribbon dress they made. I started healing and felt even better."" And the counterpart, nakedness, is also revelatory. 
 Hiding away permeates, from Geraldine hiding in her home and inside herself, to Nanabush, a character in a story, hiding inside the carcass of a dead bison, to the genesis of the Round House as a physical manifestation of the bison's carcass, a safe place, a hideaway. 
 Erdrich's work is imbued, not only with Native American characters, but with a look at Native reality on the ground, the buildings, the legal challenges, the extended family relations, in addition her use of magical realism. We are told of Native encounters with bison, turtles and cranes. We are also shown how Native people have been treated by the American legal system. That Joe's father has such long-term faith in the merits of the law is impressive, maybe inspirational and possibly sad. 
 Her compelling story carries us along at a nice pace. We get to enjoy interesting travel companions on this journey, people we want to spend time with, particularly Joe, and while we are getting from here to there, (maybe on a shuttle craft?) we are treated to a fascinating look at things we might not have seen before, ideas we might not have encountered, history we might not have known. 
 If you have read Erdrich before you know how good she is. If you have not read her before you are in for a treat. So if you get the urge to dash out and pick up a copy of The Round House all I can advise is make it so. You will definitely engage. 
 PS - In case, for some reason, you do not want to jump to the provided link, here is a very spoilerish bit on the TNG episode noted above. Skin of Evil is a Star Trek: New Generation story the boys refer to. In it a powerful, blob-like creature, torments several of the Enterprise crew, even killing one. An element of this being is that it feels terribly lonely, abandoned by its own kind. Here, Linden, our psycho killer, is the one who truly feels empty, which is ironic since he was the twin who was kept. His damaged sibling, Linda, has felt his presence all her life, and experiences emptiness, but never turned to such darkness. In the TNG episode, Armus, the baddy, was acting out of a feeling of abandonment. (Linden = wiindigoo = Armus) The twist here is that the child who was literally abandoned turned out to be a good person, while the one who was kept became a monster.

1094,Hearts In Atlantis,Stephen King,1999,2000,"Hearts In Atlantis is composed of five interconnected, sequential narratives set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War.
In ""Low Men in Yellow Coats,"" eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood and that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror.
In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest...and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast.
In ""Blind Willie"" and ""Why We're in Vietnam,"" two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow and haunted as their own lives.
And in ""Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling,"" Bobby returns to his hometown where one final secret, and his heart's desire may await him.
Full of danger, suspense, and full of heart, Hearts In Atlantis takes some listeners to a place they have never been...and others to a place they have never been able to completely leave.",Fiction,Intermediate,16,4,15,8.0625,5,3.8,277,5.0,"No one has ever written the joys of boyhood better than Stephen King. That's not what people talk about when they talk about him, but it's true. It's a subject that needs to be written about entirely without pretense and absolutely free of language too large for ball games and playing in the mud. Between this one, The Body, and It, the good reader will find himself transported into the actual moments of young pleasure, before girls take over and ruin the perfect freedom of true youth. Not that girls are bad, of course, just that something breaks at the moment when boys become aware of them and it never comes all the way back. Often, I wonder about how much of a man's life is spent trying to dance between the moment before and the excitement that comes after the discovery of girls. This small gap is the space that King covers in several of his books and all of them are delightful and thrilling in the way that only a carnival can be to a young boy. Moments of the supernatural and plot aside, it's this subject that draws me to the book. 
 For reasons I can't fully explain, I've read the first 200 pages of this one half a dozen times over the years but never finished it. I've purchased the audiobook twice (by accident) and bought the paperback two or three times (lost copies). I've decided to finish it this time because it's been hanging there, a desire that's been unfulfilled and dangling over me for years. Somehow, I need to be free of it, or at least have passed the experience into the history of my reading pleasures. So here I go. 
 William Hurt was a good choice for the audiobook. There's something about his voice that's trance-like and lulls you right in. I'm glad I've decided to finally and fully experience the book in just this way. 
 King himself read the the next two stories in the book. Some reviewers suggested that the other stories were boring, but that wasn't my feel at all. I quite enjoyed them, especially the title story. I can see, however, that someone whose only reason for reading King is action/horror excitement may not find much of value in a book that's mostly composed of nostalgia and a look back at the turning points that shaped us as people. It's not exactly the stuff of horror lore. If you're that sort, you might want to shuffle on and find another book because this one is far too delicate and filled with entirely too much longing for the adventure seeking reader. 
 Hurt returned for the final story. By now, the crossover between all the stories and characters was wrapped up tight and everywhere. It seemed almost like a novel with shifting perspectives over the years. Depending on your point of view, the interconnections could come across as overly-coincidental or just a tidy way of letting us know where things ended up with various people we'd come to know in their youth. I prefer the latter. Actually, I loved touching in on people years later, finding out how they'd turned out without the direct story of it ever really being the point of the story itself. 
 The plain fact is that this book got to me far more than it should have. It was a beautiful novel shaped like short stories and made of youth lost and memory unwound. Maybe it took me so long to actually read it because I needed the years between to lose more and more of my past into the old fireplace of time. Maybe I needed to remember only enough to know how much I'd lost and how beautiful so much of it had been. Maybe it's a book that can only be understood when your life has made the same sorts of strange turns and you look back, wondering, lost, wistful.",54.0,1,4240,8437.6,1.99,1142,5,3,3
1095,Sycamore Row,John Grisham,2013,2013,"Seth Hubbard is a wealthy man dying of lung cancer. He trusts no one. Before he hangs himself from a sycamore tree, Hubbard leaves a new, handwritten, will. It is an act that drags his adult children, his black maid, and Jake into a conflict as riveting and dramatic as the murder trial that made Brigance one of Ford County's most notorious citizens, just three years earlier.
The second will raises far more questions than it answers. Why would Hubbard leave nearly all of his fortune to his maid? Had chemotherapy and painkillers affected his ability to think clearly? And what does it all have to do with a piece of land once known as Sycamore Row?",Fiction,Intermediate,22,1,13,4.590909090909091,8,3.98,57537,4.0,"Reading the first fifty pages of Sycamore Row I experienced two very different emotions. Firstly, and I can't remember this happening before, I couldn't help but grin as I lost myself in every page, in fact I wasn't aware I was grinning until I heard my mobile ringing and looked away from the book - smiling! The second emotion was anger. Not of Grisham's writing, his narrative or style, but Seth's distant family. Racist, obnoxious, opinionated and just plain vile - you can't help but feel for Lettie the black housekeeper, a housekeeper tasked with looking after the house and an ailing Seth Hubbard for the last three years. Upon his death and his family's arrival Lettie is cast aside like a mess on a shoe, left to fend for her family and unemployed. 
 Now that I've finished Sycamore Row I can categorically say that those emotions never went away. They would bubble and fester, they weren't always present but it was as if they were stuck in limbo, waiting to emerge just like a pocket of air escaping water throughout the entire story. You never quite knew where the bubble would burst but you knew it would at some point. 
 This is without doubt the best legal thriller I've read this year, hands down the best. Set at a terrific pace this multi layered story evolves and evolves and just when you think it can't go anywhere, that the end is in nigh, the book suddenly branches off in a fresh direction, a new perspective, and Grisham introduces a new witness or a different focus to the investigation. This really is clever and sharp witted stuff! 
 Characterisation is key to any book and it was so satisfying for me to find out what happens to Jake Brigance and his family following the trial of Carl Lee Hailey. Three years down the line he's still dining out on the plaudits and fame from the case - even if the money and rewards aren't as forthcoming - and finds himself stuck in a rut doing the same old cases day in day out. Our protagonist had hoped to have moved on to bigger and better things but alas his loss is our literary gain. 
 John Grisham has brought together an eclectic mix of old and new characters. They all play their part in a legal thriller that is both entertaining and evocative. Even the nasty characters are enjoyable; they all help to add depth and colour to the book but Jake, Ozzie and Lucien carry the book as far as I'm concerned. 
 I enjoyed where the book takes the reader and where it ends and hopefully in a few years' time we'll be allowed to revisit Ford County and experience life in Reuben Atlee's courtroom once again through the eyes of Jake Brigance. With sharp dialogue, atmospheric narrative and a sagacious storyline, Sycamore Row is one not to be missed. Highly recommended.",96.0,1,3969,29013.39,7.31,627,3,5,3

While the premise of the book wasn't the same, you get the same test of loyalty since Ellen is married to Margot's older brother Andy. In fact, I would say that the test of loyalty might be stronger due to the blood relationship between Margot and Andy. 
 Anyways, I don't want to say too much, I had a feeling as to how the book would end given the title...it was just my intrigue to see how Ellen would get from point a to point b. 
 The premise of the story is something I think most people can relate to, male or female, as at some point in our lives I suspect we have all felt the same way about the road not taken. Whether it be a relationship, a job, college...etc. So this made Ellen very easy to relate to... 
 There is no tie to Giffin's other books so this one could be read before the others.",24.0,1,630,5663.7,8.99,174,2,3,2
1098,Song Of Susannah,Stephen King,2004,2006,"The next-to-last novel in Stephen King's seven-volume magnum opus, Song of Susannahis at once a book of revelation, a fascinating key to the unfolding mystery of the Dark Tower, and a fast-paced story of double-barreled suspense.
To give birth to her ""chap,"" demon-mother Mia has usurped the body of Susannah Dean and used the power of Black Thirteen to transport to New York City in the summer of 1999. The city is strange to Susannah...and terrifying to the ""daughter of none,"" who shares her body and mind.
Saving the Tower depends not only on rescuing Susannah but also on securing the vacant lot Calvin Tower owns before he loses it to the Sombra Corporation. Enlisting the aid of Manni senders, the remaining katet climbs to the Doorway Cave...and discovers that magic has its own mind. It falls to the boy, the billy-bumbler, and the fallen priest to find Susannah-Mia, who, in a struggle to cope witheach other and with an alien environment ""go todash"" to Castle Discordia on the border of End-World. In that forsaken place, Mia reveals her origins, her purpose, and her fierce desire to mother whatever creature the two of them have carried to term.
Eddie and Roland, meanwhile, tumble into western Maine in the summer of 1977, a world that should be idyllic but isn't. For one thing, it is real, and the bullets are flying. 
These are the simple vectors of a story rich in complexity and conflict. Its dual climaxes, one at the entrance to a deadly dining establishment and the other appended to the pages of a writer's journal, will leave readers gasping for the saga's final volume (which, Dear Reader, follows soon, say thank ya).",Fiction,Intermediate,10,1,14,8.0,9,3.98,87313,1.0,"I'm going to sit down and write reviews on the whole Dark Tower series after I finish, but I just have to say these books are becoming more and more tiresome. It just seems as if King has lost the vision of Roland the Gunslinger, so he - in order to have something to write about - constantly tinkers with the lore, changes history around, blames things on this multi-timestream concept, or spends whole novels describing an event merely to snap his fingers and change everything the next book so as to move his new plot line along. And the worst part of it all is that I've begun The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower and it appears to be in the same vein as the last two novels and not the great novels from earlier in the series. 
 To me, The Gunslinger, The Waste Lands and Wizard and Glass were epic works, because King seamlessly combined fantasy, post-apocalyptic, horror, and - dare I say it - western themes to create something fresh and grand. Reading one of those novels was like trying out a new dessert for the first time and savoring this delicious taste you had discovered. 
 On the other hand, The Drawing of the Three, Wolves of the Calla, and Song of Susannah read like contemporary, horror type novels, played out mainly in modern America rather than the addictive lands of Mid-World. It is just ho-hum fiction, nothing to set it apart from other books of that sort besides the title Dark Tower part whatever. 
 And if the gradual unraveling of a once great story wasn't progressing fast enough, Stephen King decides to do something that is just unthinkable to me: write himself into the story as a god-creator, almost a Rose Part Deux. 
 How could he have ever thought that was a good idea? 
 I honestly don't know, because it did nothing to actually make sense of the growing mess that is the Dark Tower series. Perhaps it will help shape the ending, but if so, I have just went todash and have witnessed the train wreck which will be the end of the Dark Tower series. 
 These are just my initial thoughts on Song of Susannah and the Dark Tower series as I begin reading the last book. No matter how annoyed I feel at this moment, I've made a commitment to finish the Dark Tower, so I will push forward, even though I cringe to think how bad the ending is going to be.",61.0,1,4239,12674.61,2.99,578,4,3,3
1099,The Guardians,John Grisham,2019,2011,"From acclaimed author Andrew Pyper, a gripping novel of psychological suspense about four men haunted by a secret from childhood.
There's no such thing as an empty house...
Trevor, Randy, Ben and Carl grew up together in the small town of Grimshaw as many boys do -- playing hockey and forging friendships that run deep. Twenty-four years later, when Ben commits suicide, the three remaining friends gather once again in their hometown. But going home means going back, and that's not always easy. The three men are forced to confront their memories of a sinister crime that happened in an abandoned house in their neighbourhood -- a crime that claws its way into the present, leaving its indelible mark on everyone.",Fiction,Intermediate,18,1,13,4.888888888888889,8,3.54,765,5.0,"I had first heard of this book by reading a glowing review for it in a newspaper, perhaps The Globe and Mail. 
 So I got on to Goodreads and added it to my to-read list. 
 Where it stayed for about two years. Every time I was deciding what to read next, I would come to this and be cooled by the 3.52 rating. It almost got to the point where I was going to take it off my list altogether. 
 What a mistake that would have been. I am shocked at the average rating of this book. I had only glazed over reviews, only because I wanted to avoid the chance of spoilers (generally negative reviews tend to be rife with them), but from what I can gather, some people have called this a knock off of Stephen King's IT or The Body. 
 Well, I guess if Pyper can be accused of anything, it would be a wonderful portrayal of four young friends in a creepy setting, and a revisit of the town's Bad Thing in their adult years. 
 GUILTY AS CHARGED! 
 This book was outstanding. Like King, he writes kids great, and also writes them great as adults. He also creeped the hell out of me. This morning as I was nearing the finish, I was lying on the couch where the telephone is over my head. Alone in the house, of course. Yes, the phone has to ring 
 just as Trevor is discovering the body in the crawlspace 
 and scare the bejeezus out of me. 
 Pyper is a hell of a writer. There are so many turns of phrases that I found so wonderful and unique that I would love to share them here, but I hate putting quotes in reviews out of context. They are best discovered as they are served.

What happens to Cujo, how he becomes a horrifying vortex inexorably drawing in all the people around him makes for one of the most heart-stopping novels Stephen King has written.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,8,15,5.529411764705882,4,3.65,162692,3.0,"When a two hundred pound St. Bernard goes rabid, no one is safe! Who will fall to Cujo before the disease he carries finishes him off? 
 I'm just going to come out and say it. Most of this book feels like filler to me. I think King took what was potentially an award winning tale of terror and jammed as much padding into it as he could until it was one of his shorter novels. Basically, it's a fantastic short story wrapped in a soap opera I couldn't give two shits about. 
 That being said, Cujo is a really powerful book in places. While I didn't care about a lot of things on the periphery, the core of it is pretty terrifying and heart-wrenching. No one wants their beloved family pet to turn on them and a rabid dog trapping a woman and her child in a car for DAYS is damn horrifying. As opposed to most of his menaces, Cujo is all too plausible. 
 The writing is good and the ending packs a huge punch. I sure didn't see that coming. It was like being kicked in the balls after you're already lying on the ground after being shot in the heart.

Then, in a moment of carelessness, Billy sideswipes an old gypsy woman as she is crossing the street--and her ancient father passes a bizarre and terrible judgement on him.
""Thinner,"" the old gypsy man whispers, and caresses his cheek, like a lover. Just one word...but six weeks later and ninety-three pounds lighter, Billy Halleck is more than worried. He's terrified. And desperate enough for one last gamble...that will lead him to a nightmare showdown with the forces of evil melting his flesh away. And away. And away...",Fiction,Intermediate,25,1,15,6.8,3,3.67,934,3.0,"And I thought the Atkins Diet sounded unhealthy... 
 William Halleck is a successful lawyer living in upper middle class splendor in a Connecticut suburb with his wife and daughter, and his biggest problem is that he's overweight. His perfect life is upset when he accidently run over an old Gypsy woman when he was *ahem* distracted behind the wheel. Since Billy is one of the solid taxpayers who plays golf with all the right people the whole mess is quickly tidied up in court without him getting so much as a ticket. However, another old Gypsy puts a whammy on him and suddenly Billy can't keep weight on no matter how much he eats. As he becomes a shadow of his former self Billy sets out on a desperate quest to track down the Gypsy and try to convince him to lift the curse of growing thinner. 
 This was the last of the novels Stephen King released under the pen name of Richard Bachman before his cover was blown shortly after its publication. (In fact, he gets cute by having a couple of characters describe the situation as sounding like a King novel.) As with the other Bachman books it seems like Uncle Stevie ran leaner and meaner in this one. He keeps the story focused tightly on its key concept, but he's also delivering some nice subtext about American culture. We've got a nicely ironic curse of a man's thoughtless greedy consumption being turned back on him as well as exploring the hypocritical way that the decent folk of New England will have their fun with the Gypsies and then run them out of town. 
 One of the strongest points here is in Halleck as a character. Billy seems like a decent guy who genuinely feels guilty about the death he inadvertently caused, and he's got the brains and courage to face up to the bizarre situation and act to save himself. However, he also went along with sweeping the whole mess under the rug, and he's willing to turn to a dangerous friend when he's really in trouble. So there's a nice mix in him that he's both somewhat willing to take responsibility even as he trying to wriggle out of the consequences of it. 
 It's a very solid piece of horror fiction that makes me wish that King would have gotten to do more Bachman books before the secret leaked out. He has published others under the name, but none were ever quite as good as the early ones.",100.0,1,555,1659.45,2.99,189,2,3,1
1102,Duma Key,Stephen King,2008,2008,"Six months after a crane crushes his pickup truck and his body self-made millionaire Edgar Freemantle launches into a new life. His wife asked for a divorce after he stabbed her with a plastic knife and tried to strangle her one-handed (he lost his arm and for a time his rational brain in the accident). He divides his wealth into four equal parts for his wife, his two daughters, himself and leaves Minnesota for Duma Key, a stunningly beautiful, eerily remote stretch of the Florida coast where he has rented a house. All of the land on Duma Key, and the few houses, are owned by Elizabeth Eastlake, an octogenarian whose tragic and mysterious past unfolds perilously. When Edgar begins to paint, his formidable talent seems to come from someplace outside him, and the paintings, many of them, have a power that cannot be controlled.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,1,15,7.222222222222222,6,3.93,75344,4.0,"DUMA KEY BY STEPHEN KING: Most Stephen King fans will admit that the last couple of novels by the international bestselling author, while selling well, have been somewhat lacking coming from the renowned horror writer; one might even go so far as to use the term ""mediocre,"" and don't get me started on Cell. Thankfully, with the arrival of Duma Key, the slate has been wiped clean and the master of horror is back! King's first novel set in his alternate home of Florida weighs in at over six hundred pages, and while it reveals a more laid-back and matured author, with the terrifying days of The Tommyknockers and It perhaps over; Duma Key is nevertheless an incredibly well written novel with some wonderfully deep and complex characters, and a world that is just as complicated but in many more ways real. 
 Enter Edgar Freemantle. An entrepreneur who started a construction company and developed it into a multi-million dollar business; loving husband of two adult daughters; until he is involved in a freak on-site accident that should've killed him, but leaves him missing his right arm, a couple of slowly healing broken ribs, and a damaged mind that results in outbursts of anger and violence. The strain becomes too great and Freemantle's marriage falls apart, leaving him an angry, empty shell. Seeking escape, he leases a beautiful house on the island of Duma Key. While watching the breathtaking sunsets, Freemantle decides to try his hand at some artwork, having sketched a little throughout his life. He discovers the more he works, the better he gets, soon switching to paints and canvasses; he also discovers that painting satisfies the seemingly insatiable itch in his missing right arm. Freemantle's work is of the sunsets and the beautiful coastline, along with the occasional abstract object added in to offset it; he is eventually tagged as an American Primitive, but as more and more people discover his work, they are amazed by it and at his first gallery showing all works listed for sale are sold. 
 But beneath the art, there is a sinister plot at work, because this is after all a Stephen King novel. Freemantle discovers a psychic ability in his work, painting items he should know nothing about, as well as the eventual power to paint events that come to fruition: whether it be the restoring of blindness, or the forced suicide of a serial killer. And then there's something wrong with the sold paintings: death follows them. The plot thickens, deepens, and becomes darker as the enigmatic history of Duma Key is discovered. It seems Freemantle isn't the only person in its history to come to the island with a fragile mind and a special ability expressed through art. Then there's the south side of the island which has become an overgrown and seemingly impenetrable jungle. The last time Freemantle and his daughter, Ilse, took a trip headed in that direction, Ilse immediately felt nauseous and horrible sick, while Freemantle felt the insatiable familiar itch that grew to an unstoppable buzzing; upon driving back north, they mysteriously found their ailments disappearing. Clearly something evil and powerful doesn't want them getting to the south of the island. 
 Duma Key is not just a novel for the fans, but a cathartic response from King over his near-death accident in 1999; no doubt he relived his agonizing recovery while writing about Freemantle, and yet it is because of this firsthand experience, that Duma Key feels much more personal and empathetic. Also being King's first foray into his new sometime Florida home, one might think his fellow Floridians a little unhappy on this introduction, or being Stephen King, they may feel the opposite and expect this. Regardless, Duma Key is a welcome return of the great horror writer, with an extra development of character and setting that King seems to have discovered in his later years, making this book one of his best, and one of my personal favorites.

Londoners Jack and Syd moved into the house a year ago. It seemed like their dream home: tons of space, the perfect location, and a friendly owner who wanted a young couple to have it.
So when they made a grisly discovery in the attic, Jack and Syd chose to ignore it. That was a mistake.
Because someone has just been murdered. Right outside their back door.
And now the police are watching them...",Fiction,Intermediate,7,1,15,5.857142857142857,14,3.57,332,5.0,"This is a wonderfully dark and twisted psychological thriller by Simon Lelic. It shifts and runs into unexpected places, different from the blurb given about the book. Jack has uncomfortable feelings about a London house that his girlfriend, Syd Baker, thinks is perfect for them. To their surprise, given they tendered a lower offer, the owner chooses them. When something is too good to be true, they should have been more wary, but they move in without a second thought. The previous owner has left behind all his belongings, which the happy couple begin to sort through. However, there are strange sounds, and gruesome discoveries in the attic. There is a child's treasure box with a familiar name on it. The story begins with the police watching the house, with Jack and Syd writing down their experiences of living there, with the occasional contentious perception. This is a novel about the past haunting the present with its firm and tenacious grip. 
 The narrative is delivered through our couple, Jack and Syd, documenting how their lives begin to spiral out of their control. Jack is a housing officer who goes out of his way to help his desperate clients. He is not close with his middle class parents who disapprove of Syd. Syd's past contains trauma and drug taking, making her a more volatile character, but she is committed to Jack, hoping for a more settled future with him. Syd's mother visits and recognises a picture on their wall. Syd finds herself becoming close to Elsie Payne, a young girl that lives locally. We learn of the details of the historical past of Syd and Jack, and how it connects to their dire present situation. This is a story that covers the issues of dysfunctional families, fathers, trust, loss and the search for justice, by whatever means possible. 
 Lelic has a gripping writing style that just grabs the reader right from the beginning. His plotting is remarkably well handled, and the narrative is so compelling, tense and suspenseful, driven by the well executed twists. I find psychological thrillers a hit or miss affair, this is a hit in every sense, I can see this being a bestseller, and deservedly so. What is really outstanding is the characters of Jack and Syd, they are superbly developed, particularly Syd. A morally ambiguous and brilliant read that I highly recommend!

1104,Freedom,Jonathan Franzen,2010,2010,"In his first novel since The Corrections, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Walter and Patty Berglund as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.
(from the back cover)",Fiction,Intermediate,19,1,15,8.517241379310345,14,3.73,3971,2.0,"UPDATED. 
 To keep in style of the book this review will be just a lot of rambling. 
 I mean, it was mostly a soap opera. And I just don't do soap operas. I can just about manage about 10 minutes every 5th episode, but that's about it. And Franzen submitted me to 570 bloody pages of a soap opera which I had to digest in a few sittings. 
 Like in all soap operas, everything ends well and love conquers all, of course some characters might have to be killed off along the way, but it seems like a small price to pay for a happy ending, non? 
 If it was well written, then maybe. But how can I take this sort of thing seriously: 
 ""Patty said no, Walter insisted, she insisted no, he insisted yes. Then she realized he didn't have a car and was offering to ride the bus with her, and she insisted no all over again, and he insisted yes"" 
 Sorry, what is this? Is this the Great American Novel? Are you kidding me? 
 ""She almost suggested to Walter that he had better kiss her first, if he was going to be asking her to live with him, but she was so offended that she didn't feel like being kissed at that moment."" 
 And if you are tired of this sugary girly revelations, you can get the more raw stuff when the perspective changes to Katz: 
 ""His dick was saying yes to something now, and this something was certainly not the wideish ass of the retreating jogger. Had death, in fact, been his dick's message in sending him to Washington? Had he simply misunderstood its prophecy?"" 
 You get the idea. 
 And don't even get me started on the fucked up chronology. It wasn't done in eloquent, mysterious way, it was done in a blabbermouth with ADHD way. It is like my friend Maciek, who tells me a story and in the middle of it he remembers some other story that might or might not be related to the story he is telling me so he tells me that other story, and then some other story that somehow came from the second story, and then maybe he will return to the main story and you end up wondering if the second story actually happened in the middle of the first story or it was just his way of telling a story. 
 The final moral from this book is that we are all fucked up in our own special way but it will all be alright unless, of course, we become Republicans, in which case there will be no redemption. 
 It almost killed me. This book almost killed me. But as they say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, therefore this book made stronger, so for that alone I had to give it two stars. 
 I will admit that Patty and Walter were both interesting characters with all the supporting cast being all sorts of caricatures and serving as props to the main duo. 
 Now, I am off to read a book about people who do things and have real problems. 
 *UPDATE - oh yeah. And I also forgot to say that if this book was written by a woman, it would be deemed chick lit and stuck in a pastel colour cover with birds and flowers. No one would even look at it twice because there is so much better chick lit out there. But as Jonathan Franzen is lucky enough to be a man, this, all of a sudden, is the Great American Novel. DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH. 
 If anyone else claims there is no sexism in literary/publishing world, this here is my best demonstrative evidence that there is. Honest to God, who would take this book seriously if it was written by a woman and had something pink on the cover?",71.0,1,860,6871.400000000001,7.99,128,2,2,2

 Crichton-mode actived! 
 ;) 
 So, my next novel had to be by Michael Crichton! 
 I went to the bookstore and this one was the first book that I checked and after reading the premise, I found it promising. ;) 
 So, I bought it and started to read it. 
 WoW!!!!!!! 
 Since the beginning I was in shock amalgamated with happiness since the style and mood of the novel was astonishing good. (Of course, by then I hadn't read yet The Andromeda Strain, so the idea of gathering a group of expert scientist to deal with something alien was something new for me :P ) 
 I don't know if happens to you, that sometimes if you are reading a novel that it hasn't being made into a film yet (I read the novel like 5 years before to be poorly adapted to a movie) sometimes I imagined some actor or actress to ""play"" the role of the character in my mind, an amusing thing was by then, in 1993, Sharon Stone was in hype due films like ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Sliver"", so when I imagined some actress to fill my image of Dr. Beth Halperin, I thought in Sharon Stone that she eventually got the role! 
 Honest to God! True story! 
 Curiously, 5 years later, Sharon Stone wasn't in hype anymore so, knowing that she was casted in the role that I pictured in my mind was amusing but odd at the same time. 
 I didn't picture Dustin Hoffman for the role of Dr. Goodman, no offense to Mr. Hoffman, which is an actor that I admired a lot, but I thought in Sean Connery for that character. 
 Anyway, the film was a big dissapointment for me since it was very poor adaptation to such excellent book, so if you ever watched the film and you didn't like it, don't worry, that's normal, 
 but please 
 , if that's the reason that you haven't read this novel yet, 
 please go and read it! 
 (Of course, if you have the luck of not having watched the film, please, PLEASE, don't watch it!) 
 I can assure you that the novel is way, way, 
 WAY 
 , better in infinite ways than that mediocre film. 
 I already mentioned the style and mood of the book, I just want to take the topic again to mention that it was a thrilling experience, since you feel that the story is taken very seriously from the scientific angle. 
 All the journey and process of exploring the alien ship is brilliant, you feel that you are there, down in the bottom in the ocean with them, walking with them. 
 There is a major spoiler in this book, that I won't comment here, don't worry, but please avoid at all costs to know that spoiler if you choose to read the book, since it's that kind of spoilers that if you already knew it before of reading the book, simply you will ruin all the fun of actually reading the book and making the investigation along with the scientist group. 
 If you like sci-fi book and/or techno-thriller novels, this is a

 option.

1106,Fates And Furies,Lauren Groff,2015,2015,"Every story has two sides. Every relationship has two perspectives. And sometimes, it turns out, the key to a great marriage is not its truths but its secrets. At the core of this rich, expansive, layered novel, Lauren Groff presents the story of one such marriage over the course of twenty-four years.
At age twenty-two, Lotto and Mathilde are tall, glamorous, madly in love, and destined for greatness. A decade later, their marriage is still the envy of their friends, but with an electric thrill we understand that things are even more complicated and remarkable than they have seemed.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,7,14,10.77777777777778,3,3.56,68846,2.0,"This book was a HUGE disappointment. I mean, holy purple prose, Batman! I really loved Lauren Groff's writing in Arcadia - it was beautiful and touching, with gorgeous metaphors. But Fates and Furies is pretentious and overwritten. It tries so hard to be a literary masterpiece that you end up with asides like this one: 
 Her mother had smelled of cold and scales, her father of stone dust and dog. She imagined her husband's mother, whom she had never met, had a whiff of rotting apples, although her stationery had stunk of baby powder and rose perfume. Sallie was starch, cedar. Her dead grandmother, sandalwood. Her uncle, Swiss cheese. People told her she smiled like garlic, like chalk, like nothing at all. Lotto, clean as camphor at his neck and belly, like electrified pennies at the armpit, like chlorine at the groin. 
 If you like convoluted metaphors and improbable life stories, you will enjoy this book. If you like reading descriptions of fictional avant-garde plays that add modernist touches to ancient stories (think Antigone transformed into ""Go""), you will enjoy this book. But most importantly, if you like the grotesque, you will enjoy this book. The entire thing is a bizarre parody of what two people's life stories could actually be like, and the fantastical, absurd elements are what really stand out. 
 The narrative constantly asks us: what is given up by each party in a relationship? What is worth giving up for a marriage, and how can two people stay together? There were a few poignant scenes where I really felt like Groff had captured this for Lotto and Mathilde, and I actually felt invested in their relationship: 
 Great swaths of her life were white space to her husband. What she did not tell him balanced neatly with what she did. Still, there are untruths made of words and untruths made of silences, and Mathilde had only ever lied to Lotto in what she never said. 
 But even that fell apart for me given how ridiculous I found most of the book. Serious ""plot"" spoilers behind tags: I probably should have stopped reading this in the first hundred pages, when in the space of a few pages, a fourteen-year-old boy first discovers the suicide of his classmate, and then his drama teacher (who - surprise! - sparks his love of acting) gives him a surprise, consolatory blow job in the high school gym . Or when I realized that Chollie (god) was a character who was actually going to stick around for awhile. Or when I got to Mathilde's half of the book, which is supposed to humanize her and round out the narrative, when really it just had me raising my eyebrows for a solid 200 pages. 
 The implication that married couples have secrets from each other is a sensible one; the idea that Mathilde had her tubes tied and then listened to Lotto talk about children for three decades is not . And something about Mathilde's self-sacrifice really rubbed me the wrong way. Near the end of the book, Mathilde begins to write plays as well, including one called Volumnia. The book blatantly tries to sell us that it's unsuccessful because Mathilde as a woman gave up so much for Lotto's success (Volumnia is always more interesting than Coriolanus, but who would go to see that play?, etc.). But after reaching the end of the book, I vehemently disagree. Lotto is a bumbling sex-focused idiot for most of the book--it's Mathilde who's cleaning up his plays, drawing on her connections to get the plays made, and managing his success. If she had put the same amount of effort or time into her own work, she would have been just as successful. I get that her past is supposed to make her look for something ""good"" and she doesn't believe she deserves the success, but the attempt to talk about her own art as secondary to Lotto's falls flat. That is a choice that she made, and it's not a choice that would have ruined the marriage. Or if it had, so what? 
 Ultimately I really hated these two people, hated the amount of dubious underage sex presented as normal, and came away thinking the entire novel just tries too way, way too hard.",680.0,1,36504,266844.24,7.31,792,5,2,3
1107,Paradise Lost,J. A. Jance,2001,2003,"John Milton's Paradise Lost is one of the greatest epic poems in the English language. It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.
Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.
(P)2009 Tantor",Fiction,Intermediate,3,12,16,14.333333333333334,10,3.8,97784,5.0,"There's all this debate over why Satan is so appealing in Paradise Lost. Did Milton screw up? Is he being cynical, or a double-secret atheist? And why is God such a dick? 
 But no one asks whether, say, Shakespeare screwed up in making Iago so much fun; they just give him credit for writing an awesome villain. And that's all Milton's doing. Satan is tempting for us because Satan is tempting for us. That's the point of Satan! If Milton didn't make him as appealing as possible, he'd be doing Satan a disservice. And Eve, for that matter. 
 Similarly, God's a dick because God's a dick. You've read the Old Testament. He's not exactly all flowers and hugs there either. Again, Milton's just being true to his characters, and writing a great story while he's at it. 
 There's slightly more to it than that, yeah. For example: it's hinted a little that God sets Satan up to fall. He gives a stern warning that anyone who disobeys him or his son will be cast out of Heaven. But since there's no sin or evil at the time of his speech, why give the warning? Isn't that like saying ""Don't touch these cookies while I'm gone"" to a kid who didn't realize there were cookies until you pointed them out? 
 Here's my advice to people considering reading Paradise Lost: read the first two books. It starts with a bang, and it's pretty amazing for a while. It slows down a bit in books III - VII, so if you're not totally sold in the first two books (I was), you can either quit altogether with a fair idea of what Milton sounds like, or skip to books IX and X. IX is the actual temptation and fall (especially fun if you're a misogynist), and X is an astonishing sequence where Adam and Eve contemplate suicide: 
 ""Why am I mocked with death, and lengthened out 
 To deathless pain? How gladly would I meet 
 Mortality my sentence... 
 his dreadful voice no more 
 Would thunder in my ears."" (Adam, X.774 - 780) 
 ""We've totally mucked this up, and our kids are gonna justifiably hate us because we got kicked out of Paradise, and maybe we should just quit while we're behind."" 
 But really, the whole thing is worth it. Took me a while - it's intense stuff, so I found that I had to read a book and then chew on it for a while to process it before moving to the next one - but it's cool. 
 In book VIII, if you're cosmologically minded, Milton lays out the whole universe. Like Giordano Bruno, he understands that our earth is a tiny speck in the universe, and he gets that all the stars are suns like ours, and therefore could have planets like ours around them. He also thinks they might be inhabited; our species might not be God's only experiment. Elsewhere, other Adams and Eves may have faced the same test of the Tree of Knowledge - and they might have passed it. Isn't that an amazing thought? 
 In books XI and XII, Michael tells Adam sortof all the rest of the stories in the Old Testament, which of course boil down to: 
 ""So shall the world go on, 
 To good malignant, to bad men benign, 
 Under her own weight groaning."" (XII 537 - 539) 
 That's your fault there, Adam. Nice work. 
 He rushes through them though, and it makes me wonder whether Milton had originally intended to retell the entire Old Testament but got bored or intimidated or something. That would've been remarkable. Certainly Paradise Lost is better literature than the Old Testament is, and significantly more coherent. 
 It's also better literature than almost everything else. Second-best poem by a blind guy ever.",188.0,1,4698,23443.02,4.99,502,4,1,4

~from the back cover",Fiction,Intermediate,8,3,14,7.625,5,3.74,537,2.0,"What if you had the chance to live your life again and again, until you finally got it right? 
 Ursula Todd is born in a snowstorm in England in 1910 but dies before she can take her first breath. During that same snowstorm she was born again and lives to tell the tale; again and again. Life after Life tells the story of Ursula's lives, as with each new life she makes small changes that send her on a completely different path. 
 I feel like I'm the only person on the planet that thought this book was overhyped and over rated. Sure Kate Atkinson has this trippy ability to create this bleak world while still managing to add some wit and compassion but it wasn't the writing that was at fault. The premise of the book makes it sound really good but let's face it; it is just Groundhog Day in disguise. The book is clever, but it tries too hard to be clever and it didn't really turn out the way it should have; for me anyway. This book is getting so many rave reviews, I feel like I am a black sheep just telling people it did not work. 
 As I said before, there is nothing wrong with the writing; Kate Atkinson has created this lyrical narrative and I did find myself being swept away in the words. I even felt like at times I was reading this book without thinking about what was happening; a few times I had to stop and process before continuing. I almost found myself not noticing a death and Ursula's life starting again and that could have got me completely lost. I did feel like Kate Atkinson did however overdo the twists and it turned out to be a roundabout way to retell the same story over and over again with different outcomes. This could have worked; and it sounds like it worked for many people but I sadly wasn't one of them. 
 I wonder if Kate Atkinson was trying something different and experimental where she could play with the character's death and life, explore the concept of life's choices and their consequences but because there were no real penalty to Ursula's life I wonder if it really worked? Do you ever have deja vu? (I don't think so, but I could check with the kitchen) Life after Life just seems to repeat the same scenes, some readers might gain a sense of familiarity and for me it just felt like I wasn't getting anywhere. 
 Life after Life is the kind of book you should probably read in a real cold climate; the snowy, dark and sometimes bleakness of the novel seems to call for it. Maybe read snuggled up on a dark winters night and don't forget your booties 'cause it's cooooold out there today (It's coooold out there every day. What is this, Miami Beach?). It is just the book that would work better in the cold; though it is never cold here in Townsville, maybe that's why it didn't work for me. 
 I really wanted to enjoy this book; I will try another Kate Atkinson novel because I really think she has a great style. Just so happened Life after Life was not for me and I know people loved this book and will probably complain about this review but at least it was just an excuse to put some Groundhog Day quotes into something. This book has had so many positive reviews so maybe it is just me, if the book sounds like something you'd like then don't let this review stop you, is it too early for flapjacks?

 Version: Unabridged Audiobook 
 Publisher: Random House Audio 
 Narrated by: Scott Brick (mostly), Adenrele Ojo & Abby Craden (read small passages) 
 I borrowed the audiobook version from my library after seeing it on all sorts of ""best of/must read/best book eva!"" lists. I swear I saw this title repeated so many times in various feeds that the damn thing had been imprinted on my brain and I requested it mindlessly from the library. What I didn't realize though was how long it was until my request came in. Even my librarian commented on the girth of the thing and complained in front of several other patrons that ""I always request the big ones"". Well, that was embarrassing. And it's not even true most of the time. 
 Sheesh, is everyone socially awkward or do I attract this sort of comment? 
 Anyway, where does one even begin with such a tome of a book? It is painfully long and spans nearly a century and features a cast of plenty that made my head spin. It starts out well enough and focuses on the tumultuous early life of a young child named Amy. I really felt for Amy and just as I was getting to know her the book switches gears and outlines a program to develop a race of super humans. Experimental injections are performed on twelve death row inmates and eventually Amy . . . Things go awry (surprise, surprise) and the world as we know it ends when a virus that turns humans into bloodthirsty beasts changes the landscape forever more. 
 Then the book fast forwards, oh almost a hundred years or so, and follows a group of survivors trying to make the best of their world which is still overrun with ""virals"". The First Colony, as they call themselves, live their lives during the day, some of them tucking themselves safely away at night while others keep a lookout for active virals. The virals can't abide sunlight and lights keep them away. But the batteries that allow the lights to function are starting to fail . . . This section of the book pretty much bored the hell out of me. It goes on for hundreds of pages, without too much of anything exciting or engaging happening. We get glimpses into the characters but never truly get to know any of them that well. Too many of these people all blend into one, especially the men who (in this audio version at least) all came across as very similar. They sound similar and there was nothing distinctive about their personalities to help me tell them apart. A few of the women (Sara, Mousami, Elisha) fare a little better. Also, way too many of these First Colony people spend their time lamenting about the fact that they are married to someone but longing for love from another, Um what? Why the heck, in a world where you could be eaten by a viral at any moment, wouldn't you express your feelings to the one you adore and find a little happiness? It didn't make sense and now that I'm finished with the book it still doesn't make sense. I guess people are idiots in the future too. The other thing that didn't make sense was the segregation of the children who are kept oblivious of the dangers of the world and live separately from their families. These people were like sheep, just mindlessly going along with the flow. Why no parents ever stood up and demand change was really unbelievable to me. Wouldn't most parents want to spend every available moment with their child instead of sequestering them with a Teacher until they're eight years old? I just didn't get it and it made me care a lot less about all of them. 
 This review is getting as long as the book so I'll try wrapping it up. The last third does pick up the pace and is actually worth reading. Amy plays a large role in the story. Things all gel together and the big picture is super interesting but the getting there? Not so much. The book is mostly humorless and read in an intensely serious tone by narrator Scott Brick. He does a decent job with the material but at times I completely tuned out without realizing it and had to rewind entire chapters at a time. Now I realize this isn't supposed to be a laugh-fest but a little humor to lighten things up here and there, or even one sarcastic character, would've gone a long way to make the story go down easier for me. And it's all about me, isn't it? I like darkness but this book is too long to be so somber. I realized things were indeed dire when I smiled after a dog viewed a puddle of vomit as an unexpected present. Yeah, I was looking for humor wherever I could get it. 
 I spent nearly two weeks listening to this on audio and I'm relieved it's over. It drained me but not emotionally which is a shame. It was a chore to get through most of it and I probably won't seek out the next one but don't quote me on that . . .",16.0,1,795,3172.05,3.99,141,2,3,3

And sometimes I can't help but wonder, what if THAT is what exactly Palahniuk wants the readers to feel about his works? Feel challenged by it, dislike it, feel disgusted or insulted by it--all of these by hurling the naked truths of human nature to the face of people in the harshest possible way? 
 My first Palahniuk book is Choke, and I was sort of culture shocked when I read it--a multitude of f-bombs being dropped from heavenly heights, sexually explicit situations, bitter but truthful ruminations about life. Completely different from the books I've been reading--and that's saying something because I usually go for the ""dark side"" of literature. I thought Choke would already build my literary panoply when it comes to his works. But I was wrong--Diary might not lie on the opposite side of the spectrum when leveled with his other works, but it's a new account of insane despair that I'm not really used to. 
 Diary is a story about art,and, well, the crazy reality that most desperate people live. It also tackles a Marxist concept but viewed from a strangely twisted angle. It is written mostly in the second person point of view and in the format of a 'coma diary' written by the female protagonist, Misty Wilmot. There is no subtlety in Palahniuk's style of writing, and when what he writes stabs, it stabs straight to the heart and conscience. It gets under your skin most of the time. 
 I will not detail everything, but I just want to say that this is a satisfying read. The Palahniuk ""flavor"" is exotic and dark, and it's the sort of taste that most readers will only refer to as ""poison"". If only everyone reads closely, the antidote to the venom of reality that Palahniuk presents in this work is also present--right between the lines.",51.0,1,2862,25729.38,8.99,1006,3,2,3

 Om det ar nagot Mo Hayder kan sa ar det att skriva bocker som gar under skinnet pa en. Precis som Dennis Lehane sa vagar hon ta ut svangarna och det ar med isande fasa man laser varje sida. 
 Forsvunnen ar inget undantag. Att lasa om kidnappade barn ar hemskt och man vet inte om Jack Caffery kommer att lyckas radda situationen. Caffery ar en lysande polis, men i denna bok sa verkar det som om kidnapparen kan forutse polisen nasta drag och ju mer tiden gar desto mer lutar det at att det ar forsent, att flickan inte kommer att raddas. 
 Sedan har vi polisdykaren Flea Marley, som lever med konsekvenserna fran foregaende bok, vilket stor henne i jobbet. Hon vet inte om att Jack misstanker henne for ett brott som hon faktiskt ar oskyldig till men som i och med det Jack vet om det ter sig logiskt att han misstanker henne. Nu ger hon sig in kampen for att radda den kidnappade flickan. Men ar hon verkligen i form att ta sig an fallet? Kommer hon istallet bara att riskera sitt eget liv? 
 Forsvunnen ar en ruggig thriller dar den okande forovaren hela tiden lurar i bakgrunden och man sitter pa helspand pa slutet nar Caffery konfronterar forovaren. Fragan ar kommer allting att sluta lyckligt?

 ENGLISH REVIEW 
 If there is one thing Mo Hayder knows is it to write a book that crawls under your skin. She dares, just like Dennis Lehane can she write in such a way that it's with terror you turn each page. 
 Gone is no exception. Reading about kidnapped children is always terrible and you do not know if Jack Caffery will be able to save the kidnapped girl. Caffery is a brilliant police, but in this book, the kidnapper seems to anticipate every single move the police do, and as more time goes by, the fear grows that they will be too late. 
 Then we have police diver Flea Marley, who lives with the consequences from the previous book, which has consequences for her at work. She does not know that Jack suspects her for a crime she's actually innocent of. Although it's quite logical that he suspects her since he doesn't have the whole picture. Now she decides to search for the kidnapped girl. But, is she really in shape to help out? Or will she only risk her own life? 
 Gone is a tough thriller where the unidentified perpetrator always lurks in the background, and at the end, when Caffery confronts the perpetrator will you still question if everything will end happily...

 It's also about futility and the fruitless nature of such longing. Instead of living in the now and making the most of what we do have the human mind always seeks such impossibilities. This creates a stream of consciousness like feel to some parts of the book. Futh may pick up an item or smell a certain smell and he is drawn back in time, ultimately, relaying his memories and demonstrating how they constantly reassert themselves in his present state. He is unable to move on and escape from the past so he can get on with his life. He has gone on holiday to get over his break-up with his wife, but instead spends the entire trip reminiscing about times gone by. 
 Moore chronicles the life of this sad character, a man rejected by his farther and abandoned by his mother who still seeks some sense of parental love long into his forties. He never got over these early problems in his developmental stages; thus, they are carried through to adulthood. At times it felt like Moore based her character, and his psychological issues, on the Freudian stages of psychosexual development. Futh has developed a strong sense of oedipal complex; he looks for his mother in other women, and especially his wife. She reminds him of his early memories, and he is drawn to the scent that activates his memories. It's why she became frustrated with him, which isn't overly surprising. 
 In his pocket Futh carries the lighthouse, a miniature perfume bottle holder that is his last physical link to his mother. He rubs it in his pocket when he gets nervous. He carries it around with him everywhere and seeks comfort in the caressing of it. It embodies her, a sense of warmth, safety and direction a mother should give to her son. The narrative is interposed with references to this safe-haven, this idealised place or person, which Futh is seeking throughout his life. He becomes a semi-functional being, a man who is deeply socially awkward, incompetent and perhaps even slightly impotent. This longing hangs over his life and prevents him from, essentially, enjoying anything and deriving any sense of success of personal achievement. 
 ""And Futh, looking at the lighthouse, wondered how this could happen--how there could be this constant warning of danger, the taking of all these precautions, and yet still there was all this wreckage."" 
 I think this book is an extremely effective exploration into one man's mind. If anything, Alison Moore shows how early childhood experiences shape a man and linger on for the rest of his life unless he actively attempts to break the cycle. And the ending she leaves us with is utterly open to interpretation, the story echoed on long after I finished reading it. I recommend it highly.",67.0,1,3996,30889.08,7.73,619,3,2,1
1119,Shutter Island,Dennis Lehane,2003,2004,"The year is 1954. U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new -partner, Chuck Aule, have come to Shutter Island, home of Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane, to investigate the disappearance of a patient. Multiple-murderess Rachel Solando is loose somewhere on this barren island, despite having been kept in a locked cell under constant surveillance. As a killer hurricane bears relentlessly down on them, a strange case takes on even darker, more sinister shades--with hints of radical experimentation, horrifying surgeries, and lethal countermoves made in the cause of a covert shadow war. No one is going to escape Shutter Island unscathed, because nothing at Ashecliffe Hospital is remotely what it seems",Fiction,Intermediate,4,12,14,13.0,3,4.08,115869,4.0,"Ashecliffe Hospital sat on the central plain of the island's northwestern side. Sat begnignly, I might add. It looked nothing like a hospital for the criminally insane and even less like the military barracks it had been before that. Its appearance reminded most of us, in point of fact, of a boarding school. 
 Teddy and Chuck are called out to the island to try and find out what happened to one of the inmates. She just escaped. There really isn't a way she could escape but there you have it. 
 The whole place is just downright creepy. Teddy is trying his hardest to figure out a code the lady left behind. It was crazy town but it all added up in the end. 
 We also get flashbacks of Teddy's wife who was killed in a fire and the supposed killer is at this same prison. Hmmmm, too convenient right? Teddy has dreams of his wife and you just plain feel sorry for him. 
 I have watched the movie several times, but this is the first time reading the book. They are both awesome. I mean talk about a twisted story. The end game blew me right out of the water! It's just too crazy to fathom, but I can see how this could happen to people. I could see how some things could push people right over the edge. And it's not a nice edge to go over.

Perhaps Oscar Wilde's quote - ""We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars"" also sums up (far more successfully and succinctly) at least a large part of this book. 
 Bach's novel and message was perhaps all well and great at the time of publication and in the context of its time. Maybe 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' did seem revolutionary at that time, but now it reads as quite a crude, clumsy and basic attempt at profundity and wisdom. 
 With little flair or much real imagination, what we have is the life and flight of a seagull (the author being a pilot) as a metaphor for life being lived without limits, seemingly as the path to immortality. 
 Neither as strong, compelling or as moving as I'd anticipated and hoped, given the novel's reputation, 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' was overall unfortunately underwhelming. There are faint echoes here of C S Lewis (Narnia/Aslan) - but without the flair for evocative storytelling. Ultimately a disappointing read.

 SWEDISH REVIEW 
 Om det ar nagot Mo Hayder kan sa ar det att skriva bocker som gar under skinnet pa en. Precis som Dennis Lehane sa vagar hon ta ut svangarna och det ar med isande fasa man laser varje sida. 
 Forsvunnen ar inget undantag. Att lasa om kidnappade barn ar hemskt och man vet inte om Jack Caffery kommer att lyckas radda situationen. Caffery ar en lysande polis, men i denna bok sa verkar det som om kidnapparen kan forutse polisen nasta drag och ju mer tiden gar desto mer lutar det at att det ar forsent, att flickan inte kommer att raddas. 
 Sedan har vi polisdykaren Flea Marley, som lever med konsekvenserna fran foregaende bok, vilket stor henne i jobbet. Hon vet inte om att Jack misstanker henne for ett brott som hon faktiskt ar oskyldig till men som i och med det Jack vet om det ter sig logiskt att han misstanker henne. Nu ger hon sig in kampen for att radda den kidnappade flickan. Men ar hon verkligen i form att ta sig an fallet? Kommer hon istallet bara att riskera sitt eget liv? 
 Forsvunnen ar en ruggig thriller dar den okande forovaren hela tiden lurar i bakgrunden och man sitter pa helspand pa slutet nar Caffery konfronterar forovaren. Fragan ar kommer allting att sluta lyckligt?

 ENGLISH REVIEW 
 If there is one thing Mo Hayder knows is it to write a book that crawls under your skin. She dares, just like Dennis Lehane can she write in such a way that it's with terror you turn each page. 
 Gone is no exception. Reading about kidnapped children is always terrible and you do not know if Jack Caffery will be able to save the kidnapped girl. Caffery is a brilliant police, but in this book, the kidnapper seems to anticipate every single move the police do, and as more time goes by, the fear grows that they will be too late. 
 Then we have police diver Flea Marley, who lives with the consequences from the previous book, which has consequences for her at work. She does not know that Jack suspects her for a crime she's actually innocent of. Although it's quite logical that he suspects her since he doesn't have the whole picture. Now she decides to search for the kidnapped girl. But, is she really in shape to help out? Or will she only risk her own life? 
 Gone is a tough thriller where the unidentified perpetrator always lurks in the background, and at the end, when Caffery confronts the perpetrator will you still question if everything will end happily...

From Subhash's earliest memories, at every point, his brother was there. In the suburban streets of Calcutta where they wandered before dusk and in the hyacinth-strewn ponds where they played for hours on end, Udayan was always in his older brother's sight. So close in age, they were inseparable in childhood and yet, as the years pass - as U.S tanks roll into Vietnam and riots sweep across India - their brotherly bond can do nothing to forestall the tragedy that will upend their lives.
Udayan - charismatic and impulsive - finds himself drawn to the Naxalite movement, a rebellion waged to eradicate inequity and poverty. He will give everything, risk all, for what he believes, and in doing so will transform the futures of those dearest to him: his newly married, pregnant wife, his brother and their parents. For all of them, the repercussions of his actions will reverberate across continents and seep through the generations that follow.
Epic in its canvas and intimate in its portrayal of lives undone and forged anew, The Lowland is a deeply felt novel of family ties that entangle and fray in ways unforeseen and unrevealed, of ties that ineluctably define who we are. With all the hallmarks of Jhumpa Lahiri's achingly poignant, exquisitely empathetic story-telling, this is her most devastating work of fiction to date.",Fiction,Intermediate,5,3,12,8.4,10,3.82,63176,5.0,"Wow. Jhumpa Lahiri's THE LOWLAND is a big novel with the power of her best short stories. 
 It follows the life of Subhash Mitra as he grows up in Calcutta and then moves to America--typical fare for Lahiri, but with much broader scope and even cleaner, crisper writing than the Pulitzer Prize winner has shown in the past. 
 With a sweeping, addictive plot, THE LOWLAND still peels naked the identities brother, lover, father, and mother, often with just a small, simple gesture. It challenges the politics of nationality with both pathetic desperation and revolutionary zeal. It makes you want and hope and despair with devastating stories of passion and indifference. 
 I won't write much about the plot because publication's still so far off, plus: spoilers. But when you read it we need to talk: I could write essays on the relationship between the two brother or the sensory magic Lahiri effortlessly conjures in the most simple domestic chores. 
 But simply put: Jhumpa Lahiri might be my favorite living writer, and this is definitely my favorite of her books.",98.0,1,35208,140479.92,3.99,818,5,3,2

The decline of gentility is evident everywhere, from tea bags, to designer sweaters, to racism masquerading as tolerance. Mutual grief allies him with Mrs. Ali, a widowed local shopkeeper of Pakistani descent who has also resigned herself to dignified, if solitary, last years. The carefully suppressed passion between these two spawns twitters of disapproval in their provincial village, but Pettigrew hasn't time for such silliness: real estate developers are plotting to carpet the fields outside his back door with mansionettes and his sister-in-law plans to auction off a prized family firearm. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ali's late husband's Muslim family expects her to hand over her hard-won business to her sullen, fundamentalist nephew, a notion she finds repellant and chauvinistic. 
It's a testament to Simonson that in this delightful novel, Pettigrew
must navigate the tragic, the absurd, and the transcendentally joyful aspects of a familiar life turned upside down by an unfamiliar and unexpected late-life love affair. That two people from opposing and mutually distrusting worlds are able to bridge every gap with unerring respect and decorum serves as a quiet suggestion that larger conflicts might be avoided or resolved in much the same way. Finally, a way forward that Major Pettigrew would approve.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,14,14,14.0,1,3.87,574,4.0,"Major Ernest Pettigrew is a decent sort, 68, retired military, widowed, and coping with the death of his younger brother, Bertie.

He is disappointed with his son, who has made a religion of career ambition, and considers the provincial notions of his neighbors less than cricket. But everything changes when he encounters Mrs. Ali, a widowed Pakistani shop-keeper. Despite their different backgrounds, Pettigrew and Ali find that they have much in common.

 As Simonson takes us through the will-they-or-won't-they she also offers a look at contemporary rural England, with old values and new engaging in public and private. With characters that have depth and heart, and a charming, endearing love story, it is easy to care, and thus to become involved, and ultimately, to enjoy. Hopefully Pettigrew's last stand will not also be Ms. Simonson's. (It wasn't)

1128,White Teeth,Zadie Smith,2000,2001,"On New Year's morning, 1975, Archie Jones sits in his car on a London road and waits for the exhaust fumes to fill his Cavalier Musketeer station wagon. Archie--working-class, ordinary, a failed marriage under his belt--is calling it quits, the deciding factor being the flip of a 20-pence coin. When the owner of a nearby halal butcher shop (annoyed that Archie's car is blocking his delivery area) comes out and bangs on the window, he gives Archie another chance at life and sets in motion this richly imagined, uproariously funny novel.
Epic and intimate, hilarious and poignant, White Teethis the story of two North London families--one headed by Archie, the other by Archie's best friend, a Muslim Bengali named Samad Iqbal. Pals since they served together in World War II, Archie and Samad are a decidedly unlikely pair. Plodding Archie is typical in every way until he marries Clara, a beautiful, toothless Jamaican woman half his age, and the couple have a daughter named Irie (the Jamaican word for ""no problem""). Samad --devoutly Muslim, hopelessly ""foreign""-- weds the feisty and always suspicious Alsana in a prearranged union. They have twin sons named Millat and Magid, one a pot-smoking punk-cum-militant Muslim and the other an insufferable science nerd. The riotous and tortured histories of the Joneses and the Iqbals are fundamentally intertwined, capturing an empire's worth of cultural identity, history, and hope.
Zadie Smith's dazzling first novel plays out its bounding, vibrant course in a Jamaican hair salon in North London, an Indian restaurant in Leicester Square, an Irish poolroom turned immigrant cafe, a liberal public school, a sleek science institute. A winning debut in every respect, White Teethmarks the arrival of a wondrously talented writer who takes on the big themes --faith, race, gender, history, and culture-- and triumphs.",Fiction,Intermediate,3,14,16,15.0,5,3.75,84311,4.0,"The more I think about this book, the more I marvel at what Zadie Smith was able to create through it. I seriously almost didn't make it through this read, and it is only in the looking back that I see just how brilliant it is. Smith starts with two characters, then links character after character to them. 
 It all starts with two men lost in WWI, having no real role in it, and discover it has ended without their knowledge. They capture a war architect after the war and invent stories in some attempt to claim true manhood. There is so much story in between. Two twin brothers, one who is sent back to the Middle East in hopes of retaining the Muslim ways. The other fully engaged in all things secular. 
 Smith does a lot of meandering, but in the end, what do a fundamentalist Muslim, a Jehovah's Witness, and ardent animal rights activists have in common? Sounds like a joke, but as it turns out, quite a lot. 
 A few things this book had me thinking about. 
 -How science and religion have become polarized. 
 -How different one generation is from the next, and how this impacts both. 
 -Many things are not at all what we expect. 
 -What defines manhood. 
 -How black and white thinking is so dangerous. 
 -How one action leads to unforeseen others, and all of life seems connected.

1130,The Round House,Louise Erdrich,2012,2012,"An exquisitely told story of a boy on the cusp of manhood who seeks justice and understanding in the wake of a terrible crime that upends and forever transforms his family.
One of the most revered novelists of our time - a brilliant chronicler of Native-American life - Louise Erdrich returns to the territory of her bestselling, Pulitzer Prize finalist The Plague of Doves with The Round House, transporting readers to the Ojibwe reservation in North Dakota. It is an exquisitely told story of a boy on the cusp of manhood who seeks justice and understanding in the wake of a terrible crime that upends and forever transforms his family.
Riveting and suspenseful, arguably the most accessible novel to date from the creator of Love Medicine, The Beet Queen, and The Bingo Palace, Erdrich's The Round House is a page-turning masterpiece of literary fiction - at once a powerful coming-of-age story, a mystery, and a tender, moving novel of family, history, and culture.",Fiction,Intermediate,12,12,16,14.25,14,3.91,69142,5.0,"The Round House is a knockout of a book. 
 Louise Erdrich is one of the true deities in America's literary Olympus. With The Round House she has used her mythic creative powers to give us a book that can be read as a page-turner about a terrible crime, the attempt to identify the criminal and take action, or as a rich, layered look at a culture in a place and time, and a lad coming of age within it, the tale imbued with telling details, a colorful palette of imagery and cultural significance. Or best of all, both. 
 The story opens with a father and son trying to remove invasive tree roots from the foundation of their home. This being Erdrich, you can figure that roots of one sort and another will figure in the story. Antone Bazil Coutts, known as Joe, is thirteen years old. His father, also Antone Bazil, is a judge with great reverence for the law. When Joe's mother, Geraldine Coutts, is brutally beaten and raped she retreats into the security of solitude, not only to allow herself time to heal, but to try to protect her family, and others as well. The thrust of the story is the puzzle of who and why. Erdrich drops clues along the way like a seasoned writer of detective fiction. 
 How we understand the world is informed by the stories we are told, the culture in which we are raised. Christians are raised on stories of magical abundance from a few loaves and fishes, reincarnation, angels, a sometimes communicative if often cranky, creator. A colorful local priest offers Christian teaching. Many of the Ojibwe we meet here have friends or relations who are believers. 
 The Ojibwe have their legends too. Erdrich shows this by imbuing her tale with magical realism. Native lore is both told in stories and shown as living reality. This is a world in which the shadow of a passing crane becomes an angel on a bedroom wall, a world in which a twin feels the presence of a doppelganger, of her separated other, and in which the evil spirit, a wendiigoo, in a dark man seeks to devour the spirits of others. Ghosts figure in the story. Joe sees one. His father reports having seen ghosts as well. Mooshum, Joe's beloved grandfather, explains something about ghosts to Joe. Other characters as well report seeing ghosts or having their own other-worldly experiences. We see the Ojibwe affiliating with and being protected by various animals. Joe seeks guidance by visiting his clan totem, herons. Another tale is told of an Ojibwe being saved by a turtle. And an old bison communicates with one young brave in a legend. In addition family names include Larks and Coutts, and a town physician is Doctor Egge. I won't ask which came first. 
 We see the events in Hoopdance, North Dakota, through Joe's eyes. Joe has a group of pals, most importantly his studly bff, Cappy. They see things through a more contemporary lens, Star Trek: The New Generation (TNG), the series having begun less than a year prior. The boys' use of TNG stories, lore in this context, offers them meaningful language with which to define elements of their world. Of particular interest is the episode called 
 Skin of Evil 
 . Don't check it out until you are reading the book. The relevance will be immediately obvious. The boys' banter and relationships give the feel of a Stephen King story, one of those in which he particularly shines at portraying young people. Together with Native beliefs and Christian teaching, we have an unusual trinity of primary interpretive influences. 
 What is the Round House? We learn it's history and generation from Mooshum. It is a meeting place and is supposed to be a safe haven, a building the Ojibwe, one in particular, were told to construct by a spirit. Religious ceremonies, among other events, take place there. And yet it has been violated, just as tree roots attempted to insert themselves in the foundation of Joe's house. We learn the story of the building's genesis, see it in benign contemporary use, and see it again, under less than benign circumstances. It is also situated in a location near where sundry jurisdictions intersect, Ojibwe, state, federal, the perplexity of which figures in the tale. 
 There is a cornucopia of riches in Erdrich's construction. Joe's father's respect for the law is almost religious, and is mirrored by the knowledge of and contempt for the law expressed by the baddie. Native lore is compared to that of classic Greece. There are plentiful references made here that inform the story. Classics like the Iliad, Shakespeare, Plato and more recently, Dune, which resonates, with a young man taking on adult responsibilities. Bazil refers to his Handbook of Federal Indian Law as his bible. This compares with the priest and his actual Bible and Mooshum, Joe's grandfather, with his oral history and tribal spiritual beliefs. Is Bazil's belief in the law any more magical than Father Travis's belief in an eternal creator? Is Father Travis's belief in a resurrected savior any more out there than believing that one can communicate with an elderly bison? 
 Clothing is used to great effect as well. When one key character is in the hospital, two relations don his clothing as a way of feeling close to him. A woman with a dicey past is shown to full effect by the costume she dons. After an infection of the spirit, a woman says that some Ojibwe women ""dressed me in a new ribbon dress they made. I started healing and felt even better."" And the counterpart, nakedness, is also revelatory. 
 Hiding away permeates, from Geraldine hiding in her home and inside herself, to Nanabush, a character in a story, hiding inside the carcass of a dead bison, to the genesis of the Round House as a physical manifestation of the bison's carcass, a safe place, a hideaway. 
 Erdrich's work is imbued, not only with Native American characters, but with a look at Native reality on the ground, the buildings, the legal challenges, the extended family relations, in addition her use of magical realism. We are told of Native encounters with bison, turtles and cranes. We are also shown how Native people have been treated by the American legal system. That Joe's father has such long-term faith in the merits of the law is impressive, maybe inspirational and possibly sad. 
 Her compelling story carries us along at a nice pace. We get to enjoy interesting travel companions on this journey, people we want to spend time with, particularly Joe, and while we are getting from here to there, (maybe on a shuttle craft?) we are treated to a fascinating look at things we might not have seen before, ideas we might not have encountered, history we might not have known. 
 If you have read Erdrich before you know how good she is. If you have not read her before you are in for a treat. So if you get the urge to dash out and pick up a copy of The Round House all I can advise is make it so. You will definitely engage. 
 PS - In case, for some reason, you do not want to jump to the provided link, here is a very spoilerish bit on the TNG episode noted above. Skin of Evil is a Star Trek: New Generation story the boys refer to. In it a powerful, blob-like creature, torments several of the Enterprise crew, even killing one. An element of this being is that it feels terribly lonely, abandoned by its own kind. Here, Linden, our psycho killer, is the one who truly feels empty, which is ironic since he was the twin who was kept. His damaged sibling, Linda, has felt his presence all her life, and experiences emptiness, but never turned to such darkness. In the TNG episode, Armus, the baddy, was acting out of a feeling of abandonment. (Linden = wiindigoo = Armus) The twist here is that the child who was literally abandoned turned out to be a good person, while the one who was kept became a monster.

1132,A Death In The Family,James Agee,1957,2012,"In this utterly remarkable novel Karl Ove Knausgaard writes with painful honesty about his childhood and teenage years, his infatuation with rock music, his relationship with his loving yet almost invisible mother and his distant and unpredictable father, and his bewilderment and grief on his father's death. When he becomes a father himself, he must balance the demands of caring for a young family with his determination to write great literature. A Death in the Family is a Proustian exploration of his past, in which Knausgaard creates a universal story of the struggles u great and small u that we all face in our lives. A Death in the Family is a profoundly serious, gripping and hugely readable work written as if the author's very life were at stake.",Fiction,Intermediate,16,9,16,13.6875,1,4.07,143,5.0,"My first impression of Karl Ove Knausgaard came from a black and white photograph published with a review of his book ""A Time For Everything"" in The New York Review of Books. 
 He is seen smoking against the rugged Norwegian landscape, hair disheveled, wearing an old, battered tee-shirt, lost in thought. Completely and unabashedly himself, yet ill at ease. Entirely present, feet deeply rooted in the present moment, yet his mind is clearly in flight, flickering at the surface of his gaze. 
 The striking portrait somehow encompasses all of the qualities of his writing: intense, raw, physical, elusive, inquisitive and elemental. 
 http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archi... 
 What Knausgaard achieves in ""My Struggle"", his mad yet mesmerizing 6-volume autobiographical enterprise, is simply the most ""real"" depiction of the movements of the mind that I have ever read. A life told in its most boring minutiae and its most elemental highs and lows, as it moves from the most mundane to the most transcendent. 
 Knausgaard plays alongside Proust or Virginia Woolf in his desire to encapsulate all of his experience as a human being, a teenager, a son, a friend, a lover, a father but most of all: a writer. But he does it with even more urgency, more radicality, more anger and more modernity. An Everyman of the 21st century with a 17th century temperament. 
 The second volume of this autobiography, which tackles the fire and vagaries of love as well as the deep ambivalences that lie at the heart of domestic life and parenthood, is utterly engrossing. 
 Read him, and listen to him below speak about Book 1, which deals with his youth and the death of his father, and he might very well change the way you look at the world around you and your own reaction to events.

1133,The Wedding,Julie Garwood,1996,2013,"It's a classic plot: a marriage of convenience that lays the groundwork for true love.
1119. Journeying from England to Scotland to wed a highlander, Lady Brenna had resigned herself to the arranged match. But when a band of fierce, painted warriors captured her en route, she fearlessly met their demand to marry their leader -- the quick-tempered laird Connor MacAlister. She couldn't know that her capture was merely the first act of vengeance against her betrothed, Connor's sworn enemy.
Brenna harbored no illusions that her husband was in love with her; after a hasty forest wedding, MacAlister assured her she could return home once she had borne him a son. But she could not deny that she had once proposed to MacAlister -- ten years ago, when she was just a child, and the visitor to her father's castle charmed her with his dazzling, unexpected smile. Now, as she sets out to win the brave chieftain whom she has come to adore, a legacy of revenge ensnares Brenna in a furious clan war -- and only her faith in her gallant hero can save her....",Fiction,Intermediate,7,6,15,7.714285714285714,8,4.18,13,5.0,"Loved it!!

I would recommend the aforementioned Gilbert Stuart commentary and biography, the Frank Budgen criticism, and especially the classic Richard Ellman biography. There is precious little here not to love regardless of your literary tastes, but like most good things, this book asks you to work for it.

The stories are told by people who have all answered an ad headlined 'Artists Retreat: Abandon your life for three months'. They are led to believe that here they will leave behind all the distractions of 'real life' that are keeping them from creating the masterpiece that is in them.
But 'here' turns out to be a cavernous and ornate old theater where they are utterly isolated from the outside world - and where heat and power and, most importantly, food are in increasingly short supply.

Practically overnight the stock market has plummeted, hyperinflation has crippled commerce, and the fragile chains of supply and high-technology infrastructure have fallen. The power grids are down. Brutal rioting and looting grip every major city. The volatile era known as ""the Crunch"" has begun, and this new period in our history will leave no one untouched. In this unfamiliar environment, only a handful of individuals are equipped to survive.
Andrew Laine, a resourceful young U.S. Army officer stationed overseas in Afghanistan, wants nothing more than to return home to Bloomfield, New Mexico. With the world in turmoil and all air and sea traffic to America suspended, Laine must rely on his own ingenuity and the help of good Samaritans to reach his family. Andrew will do whatever it takes to make it home to his fiancee, no matter how difficult the circumstances.
Major Ian Doyle is a U.S. Air Force pilot sta-tioned in Arizona with his wife, Blanca. Their young daughter, Linda, is trapped in the North- eastern riots. Three teenage orphans, Shadrach, Reuben, and Matthew Phelps, have no choice but to set out on their own when their orphanage closes at the beginning of the Crunch. Then there is Ignacio Garcia, the ruthless leader of the criminal gang called La Fuerza, who will stop at nothing to amass an army capable of razing the countryside. And over everything looms the threat of a provisional government, determined to take over America and destroy the freedoms upon which it was built.

If everything you thought you knew suddenly fell apart, would you survive?",Fiction,Intermediate,2,3,11,7.0,14,3.5,1466,1.0,"If I could give negative stars, I think I would. I read the whole book in two days mainly because I started skimming towards the end. Normally, I love post-apocalyptic tales and, since I'd found this author's previous non-fiction book to be fascinating, I thought I would likely enjoy this book, too. I didn't. I fully expected the writing to be mediocre, and I was okay with that as long as I got an interesting and informative story. Unfortunately, the story was filled with unbelievable characters who could do everything well and who preached at me constantly. There was no plot, just paper people running around surviving because they could shoot other people and because they were such wonderful Christians. The timeline was all screwed up, too. We, the readers, were jerked back and forth through time and space so often with so little warnings that I struggled keep track of where the story was and who I was reading about. Most of the info about surviving in a collapsed economy came down to having guns and gold or silver. Some of what was written might have been handy or interesting if I knew more about guns already, but rattling off gun names and characteristics doesn't teach me much. I perked up a little when he wrote that Magic Flash cubes can be rigged as an alarm system, but he never said how it was done, so I'm not sure how useful that was. One thing I did learn that could be useful is that most bad guys have shaved heads and tattoos. I'll make sure to watch out for that type. 
 I hate to just spout complaints about a book, but with this one it's hard to come up with something nice to say. And yet I did read it all the way through, which says something about it. It was oddly compelling and I wanted to like it.

Anna is afraid of him until she realizes that he is caring for his six-year-old sister on his own. Fascinated, Anna follows the two and listens as Abel tells little Micha the story of a tiny queen assailed by dark forces. It's a beautiful fairy tale that Anna comes to see has a basis in reality. Abel is in real danger of losing Micha to their abusive father and to his own inability to make ends meet. Anna gradually falls in love with Abel, but when his enemies begin to turn up dead, she fears she has fallen for a murderer. Has she? Award-winning author Antonia Michaelis moves in a bold new direction with her latest novel: a dark, haunting, contemporary story that is part mystery, part romance, and part melodrama.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,8,15,9.058823529411764,4,4.1,107,5.0,"""I'm not answering any questions,"" he said, smiling. ""I'm not one of the answering people. I'm the storyteller."" 
 Abel Tannatek is the storyteller. He is a young man hiding an ugly reality behind pretty words and magical happenings. 
 In order to find out what he is hiding, we are forced to slowly watch as the layers of his true self are revealed, one ugly layer at a time. Secrets are the only method of survival in a world where you can count on no one but yourself. Secrets are the only choice you have when you must protect the life of an innocent. 
 Enter Anna. Sheltered, clueless Anna. She has no idea of the darkness and danger outside of her safe little world. 
 It's late, Anna...they'll be waiting for you, at home...in that house where the air is always blue...they'll be worried. 
 A chance meeting between the school's drug dealer and an innocent, sheltered student came about because of a lost doll. Had Anna not found the doll, she would have carried on her life as usual. There would be no danger, no mystery, no killing for her to know about. One might say that finding the doll was the worst thing that could have happened to her. I would disagree. 
 Abel is a broken human being. He's broken to the point of ill repair, yet Anna still sees something in him that's worth saving. As we see Abel through Anna's eyes, we are shown just how much a person will endure in order to spare a life so precious to him - the life of a tiny little girl in a pink jacket. 
 Abel and Anna bond through time shared as Abel spins wonderful fairytales into existence for his younger sister. Real life becomes the backdrop for the fantasy. Characters in reality become characters in the story. A mystery starts to unfold as characters in the story become bigger players in crimes which start taking place in the real world. Who is the killer? Why does Abel seem to have so much to hide? Why are other people interested in what Abel and Anna are up to? 
 I can't divulge much without going into spoiler territory. The Storyteller is so beautifully written. The depth of character and layers of detail are heart-breakingly intricate. After I finished, I was left with a few different emotions. Anger and sadness were probably the two most prominent, but I can't say that I have any regrets reading this book. I had a hard time putting my reader down because the story of Abel and Anna was such a pull. 
 As for the character flaws...I suppose I should address those. Both Abel and Anna disappointed me in a way because of their actions, yet I felt as if their actions made them more real. Abel was abused, so he had no other experience to draw from in learning how to interact with others. Anna had an empty but satisfactory life and she craved more than her own existence inside of a pretty box. Abel was able to give her something she'd never had before and because of this, she was quick to forgive at times when others wouldn't.

But 'here' turns out to be a cavernous and ornate old theater where they are utterly isolated from the outside world - and where heat and power and, most importantly, food are in increasingly short supply.

On October 1, God is in His heaven, the stock market stands at 10,140, most of the planes are on time, and Clayton Riddell, an artist from Maine, is almost bouncing up Boylston Street in Boston. He's just landed a comic book deal that might finally enable him to support his family by making art instead of teaching it. He's already picked up a small (but expensive!) gift for his long-suffering wife, and he knows just what he will get for his boy Johnny. Why not a little treat for himself? Clay is feeling good about the future.
That changes in a hurry. The cause of the devastation is a phenomenon that will come to be known as The Pulse, and the delivery method is a cell phone. Everyone's cell phone. Clay and the few desperate survivors who join him suddenly find themselves in the pitch-black night of civilization's darkest age, surrounded by chaos, carnage, and a human horde that has been reduced to its basest nature...and then begins to evolve.
There is really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clay, an arrow points home to Maine, and as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north they begin to see crude signs confirming their direction. A promise, perhaps. Or a threat...

 The story centers around a mass event that turns anyone who happens to be on their cell phone at the time into a zombie. Mass chaos ensues and a small group of survivors bands together and tries to figure out what is going on and how to stop it. Some of the plot-line does have some similarity to The Stand, but the characters are fairly unique, the dialog is good, and the action keeps rolling along at a fairly brisk pace. 
 I really liked this novel. I knew that I probably would, but it was a nice surprise that it was as good as it was.

Stephen King has, in his time, played with both sources of the nightmarish and in Dreamcatcher, the first complete novel since his near-fatal accident, he gives us both.
Four childhood friends, united by secrets, are caught in the quarantine zone when something crashes into the remote forests of Maine; and the question becomes who will avoid being eaten alive by alien fungi, torn from the inside by alien ferrets, possessed by alien minds or menaced by a psychotic military commander to whom ruthlessness has become a macho ego trip?
The Earth is in peril as well, needless to say, but most of our attention is taken up with a few men caught on the edge, and where the most important thing in the world turns out to be the fact that four small boys saved a fifth from a beating.
This has the hall-marks of a good King novel--memorable catchphrases whose meaning we only gradually learn and a sense of how it feels to be human. --Roz Kaveney",Fiction,Intermediate,15,1,15,5.2,10,3.59,522,3.0,"As I was going up the stair 
 I meet a man who wasn't there; 
 He wasn't there again today! 
 I wish, I wish he'd stay away. 
 Well, what a ride that was... 
 Rating this book was quite hard. I'm still not sure if I'm okay with giving it 3 stars, because it had so many good characters, parts and plot twists, so one part of me feels like giving it 5 stars. But then again, at some parts, it left me feeling miserable and asking myself if I was ever going to finish it, so because of that, the other part of me think that it deserves only 2 stars. So I guess I'll just have to settle and give it 3 (3.3) stars. But still, I don't think I've ever wished that Goodreads had a half-star system, as much as I do now. 
 Dreamcatcher is a book about alien invasion, but it's unlike any other alien invasion book. Also, it is unlike any other Stephen King's book that I've read. The book started out great. I actually loved the first half. I loved getting to know our main characters, I loved the plot, and I loved how King introduced aliens. There were even some scenes that creeped me out, and at some parts I even had to stop reading for a few seconds. But then, somewhere in the middle, something happened, and the book unfortunately got worse. It started dragging on and at some parts it became flat out boring. Then, maybe 50 pages before the end, the pace picked up again, and it got back to being amazing. I absolutely loved the way it ended, and how everything came together. 
 When it comes to characters, just like in any other King's work, they were my favorite part of this book (well, at least some of them were). I loved our main four characters (Henry and Jonesy especially). I also loved Duddits, and even Owen. But, on the other hand, there is Kurtz - a character I absolutely despised. And he is the main reason why I had problems with this book. I think that his character was completely unnecessary. I loved reading from everyone's point of view except from his. And the irony was that his chapters got bigger and bigger as the book went on. In my opinion, he brought nothing to the story, and was only there to make it longer. If his character was removed from the story I don't think that anything important in the plot would change. 
 In the end, even though this book made me question my sanity a few times, I'm still glad that I've read it. Even though it had some bad parts, it also had so many more amazing parts.",54.0,1,316,1576.84,4.99,310,1,5,2

Cukup singkat kebersamaan mereka, tapi sampai saat ini, detik ini, kapanpun papa menceritakan soal mama, beliau menceritakan mama dengan pancaran cinta yang tak pernah berubah. Terkadangpun saat kami duduk bareng, papa masih berbicara seakan-akan mama saya masih ada, ""Min, anakmu sudah besar sekarang. Mia sudah bisa cari uang sendiri lho, lihat saja bukunya semakin numpuk tiap hari""

Who will fall to Cujo before the disease he carries finishes him off? 
 I'm just going to come out and say it. Most of this book feels like filler to me. I think King took what was potentially an award winning tale of terror and jammed as much padding into it as he could until it was one of his shorter novels. Basically, it's a fantastic short story wrapped in a soap opera I couldn't give two shits about. 
 That being said, Cujo is a really powerful book in places. While I didn't care about a lot of things on the periphery, the core of it is pretty terrifying and heart-wrenching. No one wants their beloved family pet to turn on them and a rabid dog trapping a woman and her child in a car for DAYS is damn horrifying. As opposed to most of his menaces, Cujo is all too plausible. 
 The writing is good and the ending packs a huge punch. I sure didn't see that coming. It was like being kicked in the balls after you're already lying on the ground after being shot in the heart.

 Usually this bothers me, the way the movie may influence my reaction to the book, but not with Breakfast at Tiffany's. This story has a different feeling, it's the kind of stories that leaves you to think a lot after finishing it, even though its plot is really not that complicated. 
 I don't think i can say anything new about this book, i am just glad i finally read it. 
 Holly Golightly is a fascinating character, the book seemed to be just a sneak peek into her life during a small moment and after that she was gone again.

I'm tempted to bump it up to three stars, because there are definitely some good parts to it and because I absolutely loved the first book, but honestly right now it feels like a two star book. 
 While the first book wasn't perfect, I found it to be utterly charming. Everything about it was so sweet and fun and real. The Rosie Effect, by contrast, feels like ... well, it feels like an author rushing out a sequel to capitalize on the enormous success of the first book. I'm not saying that was the author's intent, but that's what it feels like. 
 Both Rosie and Don clearly have some issues, but it's the way they work together that made the first book work so well. Rosie is a tough character to get, but it seems like she like understands and accepts Don and is making progress in her own life. Don, on the other hand, doesn't logically feel like Rosie is his match, but he connects with her and loves her despite that. Obviously when you have a sequel that's based on a romantic pair you need to throw a wrench in their lives and cause chaos, because otherwise you don't have a story. What I didn't expect was a total reversal of these roles from the first book. I didn't expect the characters to regress. 
 Despite being the titular character, Rosie is basically absent for a lot of this book. She's in the background completing her thesis and generally being every kind of stereotype for an absent-minded shrew of a pregnant woman. Seriously, I wanted to strangle Rosie for the things she was doing and saying. Obviously she's a character with issues, but she was also sweet and fun and accepting. I didn't see any of that here, and it really upset me to see the author write Rosie this way. 
 There are so many other things that made me dislike this one. Don's actions were beyond ridiculous. There are the social faux pas that I would expect from his character, and then there were things that went WAY over the top. There's also the way Gene was part of this book, of which I would say there was way too much of his character -- there was really no point to his part in the story. And then, probably most importantly, is the fact that this book doesn't really have much of a plot. It's all about marital problems, lack of communication, and a crazed social worker (surprise! it's a female character acting completely unprofessionally and illogically) taking out her own issues on Don. Of course things happen, but it really feels like one long ramble with very little purpose to it.

Here I was, book nowhere in sight, and yet I still found myself at points of my day, wondering what Henry and Schwartz and Pella were doing at that very moment. The hype for this one? TOTALLY WORTH IT. 
 And to say ""The Art of Fielding"" is a book about baseball is to say ""Friday Night Lights"" is a TV show about football. Yes, yes, the book's protagonist is short stop (and baseball phenom) Henry Skrimshander. Yes, there are plenty of scenes that involve the diamond and batting cages (and a central plot point that involves Henry's first-ever errant throw). But it's SO much more than that so don't let all the sports talk dissuade you from reading it. Because wrapped up in all those baseball analogies are the universal themes of suffering and failure and that age-old question of ""What am I doing with my life?"" It may be a stretch for some, but for me, this is as good as it gets in earning that rare title of Great American Novel. 
 Finally, my love for ""Art"" may very well be jaded but that's only because I've learned so much about how it came to be. Chad Harbach spent NINE years laboring over this, his first-ever novel. NINE YEARS. Only to go from a poor guy with debt collectors after him to landing a book contract worth more than $600,000. If you've made it this far in this review (god bless you), and if you love ""Art"", you owe it to yourself to find a way to read the Vanity Fair story that details how this book came to be. Find it either in the October 2011 issue of Vanity Fair or online in this eBook (which, it may be $2 but it's worth the investment if you have an e-reader.

1156,The Wedding,Danielle Steel,2000,2013,"It's a classic plot: a marriage of convenience that lays the groundwork for true love.
1119. Journeying from England to Scotland to wed a highlander, Lady Brenna had resigned herself to the arranged match. But when a band of fierce, painted warriors captured her en route, she fearlessly met their demand to marry their leader -- the quick-tempered laird Connor MacAlister. She couldn't know that her capture was merely the first act of vengeance against her betrothed, Connor's sworn enemy.
Brenna harbored no illusions that her husband was in love with her; after a hasty forest wedding, MacAlister assured her she could return home once she had borne him a son. But she could not deny that she had once proposed to MacAlister -- ten years ago, when she was just a child, and the visitor to her father's castle charmed her with his dazzling, unexpected smile. Now, as she sets out to win the brave chieftain whom she has come to adore, a legacy of revenge ensnares Brenna in a furious clan war -- and only her faith in her gallant hero can save her....",Fiction,Intermediate,8,1,15,7.714285714285714,6,4.18,13,5.0,"Loved it!!

1158,The Rescuers,Margery Sharp,1960,2011,"MISS BIANCA IS A WHITE MOUSE OF GREAT BEAUTY and supreme self-confidence, who, courtesy of her excellent young friend, the ambassador's son, resides luxuriously in a porcelain pagoda painted with violets, primroses, and lilies of the valley. Miss Bianca would seem to be a pampered creature, and not, you would suppose, the mouse to dispatch on an especially challenging and extraordinarily perilous mission. However, it is precisely Miss Bianca that the Prisoners' Aid Society picks for the job of rescuing a Norwegian poet imprisoned in the legendarily dreadful Black Castle (we all know, don't we, that mice are the friends of prisoners, tending to their needs in dungeons and oubliettes everywhere). Miss Bianca, after all, is a poet too, and in any case she is due to travel any day now by diplomatic pouch to Norway. There Miss Bianca will be able to enlist one Nils, known to be the bravest mouse in the land, in a desperate and daring endeavor that will take them, along with their trusty companion Bernard, across turbulent seas and over the paws and under the maws of cats into one of the darkest places known to man or mouse. It will take everything they've got and a good deal more to escape
with their own lives, not to mention the poet.
Margery Sharp's classic tale of pluck, luck, and derring-do is amply and beautifully illustrated by the great Garth Williams.",Fiction,Intermediate,2,11,16,13.5,1,4.08,77,4.0,"Miss Bianca enjoys her plush existence, living in her Porcelain Pagoda as the pampered pet of the Ambassador's son. But when word reaches the Prisoners' Aid Society that a Norwegian poet is locked up in the dreadful Black Castle, Madam Chairwoman knows that Miss Bianca's international connections and social savvy are just the thing to help free the prisoner. With the aid of the pantry mouse Bernard and the Norwegian sailor mouse Nils, Miss Bianca heads to the Black Castle to face dangers great and small in the name of their noble cause. 
 My Disney source material readthrough has led me to The Rescuers, and it appears that while there are two movies based on these characters and several books in the series, none of them were adapted exactly into either of the films. It was still fun and interesting to read the inspiration for the films and get to know the characters as Margery Sharp originally envisioned them. This story was simple but well fleshed-out, and the society of mice is amusing and actually makes sense (even though it never really says where they live or how they work internationally). I'm still not sure whether or not the poet belonged in prison, or what he did to get there in the first place (apart from the assertion that ""he's a poet""), but the point of this story was the mice anyway. Miss Bianca is a charming little character, refined and quite self-assured, but also just the slightest bit vulnerable. Bernard is loyal and devotedly attached to Miss Bianca, and Nils provides an energetic element as the third in the trio. The threats they faced seemed fitting for the setting and scope, and although things worked out a little conveniently, it was fun to see how it all played out. There was a simplicity and something poetic about how this was written, which was refreshing compared to current children's literature. 
 As for the illustrations, as much as it pains me to speak ill of Garth Williams, I just don't understand why he feels the need to make every living creature look like every bit of them is covered with shaggy hair. Let the mice tails and the humans' noses have some smooth lines! I promise it will be okay. 
 Disney didn't really take many cues from this book for either of its Rescuers movies, but this was a quick, refreshing read. It's a fun premise for a book series, and it was good to discover the original Bernard and Miss Bianca.",2.0,1,2866,8569.34,2.99,22,3,1,1
1159,The Cider House Rules,John Irving,1985,1986,"Raised from birth in the orphanage at St. Cloud's, Maine, Homer Wells has become the protege of Dr. Wilbur Larch, its physician and director. There Dr. Larch cares for the troubled mothers who seek his help, either by delivering and taking in their unwanted babies or by performing illegal abortions. Meticulously trained by Dr. Larch, Homer assists in the former, but draws the line at the latter. Then a young man brings his beautiful fiancee to Dr. Larch for an abortion, and everything about the couple beckons Homer to the wide world outside the orphanage ...",Fiction,Intermediate,21,1,14,5.761904761904762,6,4.1,321,4.0,"Hey! I just popped my John Irving cherry with The Cider House Rules! 
 Something strange happened midway through reading The Cider House Rules, my first John Irving book.* I found myself completely immersed in its world. 
 What's strange is that for the first couple hundred pages, I didn't particularly believe in this early 20th century Dickensian fable about orphans, surrogate families, an ether-addicted abortionist and the arbitrariness of some rules. But Irving's storytelling skills eventually won me over. His prose is persuasive. 
 Homer Wells is raised in an orphanage in the isolated town of St. Cloud's, Maine. Although he's been placed with families four separate times, something has always gone wrong with his adoptions, and so he continually ends up back at the orphanage, where he eventually assists Dr. Wilbur Larch in his unusual obi/gyn practice. 
 Women come to St. Cloud's to either give their children up for adoption or have the doctor terminate their pregnancies. When Homer is old enough to understand the latter, he decides to stop helping with those procedures. And when Wally Worthington and Candy Kendall, a glamorous young couple who've come to terminate their own unexpected pregnancy, tell Homer about the apple orchards back home near the ocean, he leaves with them, planning to stay just for a week or so to learn about orchards for the orphanage. 
 The book essentially recounts Homer's coming-of-age. Out in the big bad world, he realizes that evil and temptation exist, and that moral choices aren't so black and white. Having grown up in an old-fashioned world, presided over by Larch and Nurses Edna (who's secretly in love with Larch) and Angela, he's been insulated. Choices seem so much easier in the books that he used to read to the orphans: Dickens's Great Expectations and David Copperfield (for the boys), and Jane Eyre for the girls. 
 In a sense, Homer sets out to realize his own great expectations, working in the orchards that Wally's mother runs, falling in love with Candy and forging a lasting friendship with Wally. Meanwhile, Dr. Larch, who's addicted to inhaling ether, is getting older; the board of the orphanage is looking to replace him. Will Homer eventually return? 
 Anyone who's only seen the film version will be surprised by a plotline about another major character, Melony, an orphan who initiates Homer into sex and feels betrayed by his departure. She's determined to track him down, but her motivations remain vague. Revenge? Jealousy? Again: because Irving is such a smooth and skilled writer, the Melony sections are always readable and provide a bit of tension in a plot that can sometimes feel loose. 
 A few other quibbles: Homer's decision to leave with Candy and Wally feels odd, especially since he just meets them. Often the book's humour works, but just as often it feels contrived. And I felt cheated at the end when some big secrets are revealed - things we've anticipated for half the book - and we don't get to see the characters' responses. 
 But I came to love Irving's people. I loved seeing them interact with each other, pick up experience, get older, reflect on their earlier selves. They'll teach you about the female reproductive system or how many bushels of apples it takes to create a vat of cider. They'll make you consider how something as simple as a Ferris Wheel might seem mysterious and magical, or how it might feel to ride a bicycle if you've never ridden one before. 
 I also liked the book's central allegory about blindly following rules. At times the theme felt a bit didactic, but at others times it felt beautifully integrated into the story. 
 The author has great empathy for his characters. And he knows how to create an entire fictional world. The details might not seem true in today's busy, cynical world, but they do in the world of the book. And that's enough for me. 
 I'm looking forward to entering another one of Irving's fictional worlds soon.

AUTHOR'S FOREWORD
You might not want to buy this book.
I know, that's not the sort of thing an author is supposed to say. The marketing people aren't going to like this. My editor is going to have a fit. But I'd rather be honest with you right out of the gate.
First, if you haven't read my other books, you don't want to start here.
My first two books are The Name of the Windand The Wise Man's Fear. If you're curious to try my writing, start there. They're the best introduction to my world. This book deals with Auri, one of the characters from that series. Without the context of those books, you're probably going to feel pretty lost.
Second, even if you have read my other books, I think it's only fair to warn you that this is a bit of a strange story. I don't go in for spoilers, but suffice to say that this one is ... different. It doesn't do a lot of the things a classic story is supposed to do. And if you're looking for a continuation of Kvothe's storyline, you're not going to find it here.
On the other hand, if you'd like to learn more about Auri, this story has a lot to offer. If you love words and mysteries and secrets. If you're curious about the Underthing and alchemy. If you want to know more about the hidden turnings of my world...
Well, then this book might be for you.",Fiction,Intermediate,4,2,14,7.75,11,3.91,107,5.0,"This is a story for people like me. 
 Names are important. The act of naming is deep magic, old magic. Of 3s, of 7s, of 9s. Of unnamed stairs, unknown places, of a nameless world named, this story is beyond beauty, it is right, balanced true. 
 Reading this before the official release, is a treat. It is also a privilege. One I am not entirely certain I deserve. 
 By now, you know that this is not book 3 in Pat's wondrous Kingkiller Chronicle. I think it's better than book 3. Better because it's here, ready to be read, to be loved, to be held, to be reread. Book 3 isn't ready yet, and that's okay. Book 3 will arrive in its own time, not before. And when book 3 is ready, it will be... it will be beautiful, and sad, and polished smooth as a round river stone tucked secret by water, time, and patients. But for now, The Slow Regard of Silent Things is to be savored. Best served slow with deliberate attention to appreciation, a nibbling, a pause, a tasting. Don't bolt back this narrative. Rather, relish the layering, the quiet craft, the breathless wonder of secret places, of dark places. 
 This is a sliver of Auri's story, her tending of the world. I can not imagine a better glimpse into the Underthing. I didn't want it to end. 
 I was mesmerized. Call it what you like, spellbound, tongue-tied, lost to the deep-dive rapture of never wishing to surface, I shucked the here, and found myself there. As a reader, Auri is dear to me. I can only hope that what is to come will not press a lasting grief or harm upon her. 
 Keep her safe, Pat. Please keep her safe. 
 We all know Pat is a skilled writer. His proficiency with language and syntactical meter are deceptively pleasing, and when combined with a shrewd attention to detail, you can't help but recognize the art within the craft. This story is unique, in content and presentation. And such dialogue would be better had round a fire, with a dram as winter hunkers down, than in an asynchronous online book review. Yes, this story is a little different. But all you need to know is that it's good. 
 Now, let's talk audiobook. 
 Pat Rothfuss steps out from behind his clackity-clunkity keyboard and permits us to bask in his narrator debut. Rothfuss is a solid reader. Yeah, he's got a pleasing set of pipes. Yeah, he's a great writer. But the guy narrates like a natural. I know I know I know. Reading out loud? What's the big deal? First of all, it is a big deal. And nextly, it's far more difficult than most might imagine. Many professional narrators overact the text, or slip into an ear-bleeding map reading cadence, rendering a jagged, and regretful, audio experience. Rothfuss delivers a reading ripe with feeling and authenticity. I hope, far in the future when Pat has an abundance of time, he will go back and read all of The Kingkiller Chronicles. Not too many authors find success in reading their own work. Neil Gaiman can, but then again, Gaiman could read pharmaceutical warning labels and I'd clap like a drunken seal, barking for more more more! Point being, Rothfuss does a damn fine job reading his first audiobook. 
 Here's my advice: 
 Grab the audiobook. Experience this story as spoiler-free as possible. Keep an ear/eye out for hidden gems within the text, they are there, but I ain't tellin where.",15.0,1,4240,16917.600000000002,3.99,1156,4,3,2

After responding to several calls with paramedics, he notices that all the dead children were read the same poem from the same library book the night before they died. It's a 'culling song' - an ancient African spell for euthanising sick or old people. Researching it, he meets a woman who killed her own child with it accidentally. He himself accidentally killed his own wife and child with the same poem twenty years earlier. Together, the man and the woman must find and destroy all copies of this book, and try not to kill every rude sonofabitch that gets in their way. Lullabyis a comedy/drama/tragedy. In that order. It may also be Chuck Palahniuk's best book yet.",Fiction,Intermediate,3,7,15,10.666666666666666,2,3.73,67526,3.0,"When you pick up a Chuck Palahniuk book you know that you are going to plunge ever-so-briefly into a raging torrent of absurdity, horror so whimsical that you laugh even as you cringe, and insightful looks at contemporary living. It seems a cheap shot to call his work formulaic, but once you've read through 6 or 7 of his books, the pattern emerges and you have a vague idea of what to expect. 
 It was Lullaby that finally brought this realization home to me. You have the protagonist, a man who seems like the picture of upstanding normality at first glance but who is eventually revealed to have a dark secret hidden in his past. You have the more experienced secondary character who helps to drive the story forward by slowly revealing some answers to the mystery. Then you have the comical minor characters, the latter-day Rosencratz and Guildenstern (or the R2D2 and C3PO if you want to take it that far) if you will, who play an important roll in the advancement of events but who also provide the brilliant moments of macabre hilarity. At some point they will all go on a roadtrip and Palahniuk will ruminate on the state of human existence at the turn of the 21st Century. 
 And so it goes for Lullaby. Features reporter Carl Streator is assigned to report on crib death for a mid-size Portland newspaper. As he visits site after site of these tragic deaths, he notices the constant appearance of a book of children's poems all laying open to Page 27. It appears that prior to dying the infants had all been read this particular poem. Being the thorough investigative reporter that he is, Streator traces crib deaths in his area back over 20 years until he comes across Helen Hoover Boyle, a Realtor who specializes in selling (and reselling and reselling again) haunted houses to unsuspecting clients, who may know the reason why this particular poem seems to kill. It's not long before Streator, Helen, her assistant Mona (known as Mulberry in the Wiccan circles in which she travels) and Mona's boyfriend Oyster embark on a roadtrip across the country to track down every copy of this culling poem to protect the sleeping infants of the world from inadvertent death. 
 Like I said it's formulaic, but this just makes it easier to focus on the odd details that Palahniuk likes to toss into the mix. Oyster's long narrations about the history of invasive foreign plants and how this can be used as a means to understand the cannibalistic psyche of modern man, an EMT who learns the culling poem so that he can kill fashion models and then have sex with their dead bodies, the twisted history of antique furniture- they all add together to form a novel that, while not spectacular, definitely envelops you and reminds you why it is that Palahniuk stands out as one of the best contemporary authors of today.",27.0,1,53352,426282.48,7.99,671,5,2,2

He divides his wealth into four equal parts for his wife, his two daughters, himself and leaves Minnesota for Duma Key, a stunningly beautiful, eerily remote stretch of the Florida coast where he has rented a house. All of the land on Duma Key, and the few houses, are owned by Elizabeth Eastlake, an octogenarian whose tragic and mysterious past unfolds perilously. When Edgar begins to paint, his formidable talent seems to come from someplace outside him, and the paintings, many of them, have a power that cannot be controlled.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,1,15,7.222222222222222,6,3.93,75344,4.0,"DUMA KEY BY STEPHEN KING: Most Stephen King fans will admit that the last couple of novels by the international bestselling author, while selling well, have been somewhat lacking coming from the renowned horror writer; one might even go so far as to use the term ""mediocre,"" and don't get me started on Cell. Thankfully, with the arrival of Duma Key, the slate has been wiped clean and the master of horror is back! King's first novel set in his alternate home of Florida weighs in at over six hundred pages, and while it reveals a more laid-back and matured author, with the terrifying days of The Tommyknockers and It perhaps over; Duma Key is nevertheless an incredibly well written novel with some wonderfully deep and complex characters, and a world that is just as complicated but in many more ways real. 
 Enter Edgar Freemantle. An entrepreneur who started a construction company and developed it into a multi-million dollar business; loving husband of two adult daughters; until he is involved in a freak on-site accident that should've killed him, but leaves him missing his right arm, a couple of slowly healing broken ribs, and a damaged mind that results in outbursts of anger and violence. The strain becomes too great and Freemantle's marriage falls apart, leaving him an angry, empty shell. Seeking escape, he leases a beautiful house on the island of Duma Key. While watching the breathtaking sunsets, Freemantle decides to try his hand at some artwork, having sketched a little throughout his life. He discovers the more he works, the better he gets, soon switching to paints and canvasses; he also discovers that painting satisfies the seemingly insatiable itch in his missing right arm. Freemantle's work is of the sunsets and the beautiful coastline, along with the occasional abstract object added in to offset it; he is eventually tagged as an American Primitive, but as more and more people discover his work, they are amazed by it and at his first gallery showing all works listed for sale are sold. 
 But beneath the art, there is a sinister plot at work, because this is after all a Stephen King novel. Freemantle discovers a psychic ability in his work, painting items he should know nothing about, as well as the eventual power to paint events that come to fruition: whether it be the restoring of blindness, or the forced suicide of a serial killer. And then there's something wrong with the sold paintings: death follows them. The plot thickens, deepens, and becomes darker as the enigmatic history of Duma Key is discovered. It seems Freemantle isn't the only person in its history to come to the island with a fragile mind and a special ability expressed through art. Then there's the south side of the island which has become an overgrown and seemingly impenetrable jungle. The last time Freemantle and his daughter, Ilse, took a trip headed in that direction, Ilse immediately felt nauseous and horrible sick, while Freemantle felt the insatiable familiar itch that grew to an unstoppable buzzing; upon driving back north, they mysteriously found their ailments disappearing. Clearly something evil and powerful doesn't want them getting to the south of the island. 
 Duma Key is not just a novel for the fans, but a cathartic response from King over his near-death accident in 1999; no doubt he relived his agonizing recovery while writing about Freemantle, and yet it is because of this firsthand experience, that Duma Key feels much more personal and empathetic. Also being King's first foray into his new sometime Florida home, one might think his fellow Floridians a little unhappy on this introduction, or being Stephen King, they may feel the opposite and expect this. Regardless, Duma Key is a welcome return of the great horror writer, with an extra development of character and setting that King seems to have discovered in his later years, making this book one of his best, and one of my personal favorites.

Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls. Three times during history's darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe, becoming out of necessity even more austere and less dependent on technology and material things. And Erasmas has no fear of the outside--the Extramuros--for the last of the terrible times was long, long ago.
Now, in celebration of the week-long, once-in-a-decade rite of Apert, the fraas and suurs prepare to venture beyond the concent's gates--at the same time opening them wide to welcome the curious ""extras"" in. During his first Apert as a fraa, Erasmas eagerly anticipates reconnecting with the landmarks and family he hasn't seen since he was ""collected."" But before the week is out, both the existence he abandoned and the one he embraced will stand poised on the brink of cataclysmic change.
Powerful unforeseen forces jeopardize the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros--a threat that only an unsteady alliance of saecular and avout can oppose--as, one by one, Erasmas and his colleagues, teachers, and friends are summoned forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster.

Like. Ever. 
 Not only has this seminal masterwork of fiction withstood a second read with flying colors, but it continues to define and defy both Science Fiction and Speculative Fiction categories. Heck, I think we can say it belongs on any Philosophy shelf, too, and I defy anyone to not laugh their heads off at the haircuts or Rakes or so many beautiful easter-eggs of ideas studded through the opening couple hundred pages. 
 What? It's just a bunch of monks talking philosophy and science in an alien world? How the heck could that be fun? 
 Ahh, this book moves on from that soon enough, especially when mysteries both small and really large start piling up, and the high-tech history of the world with it's truly awesome advances is only *part* of the reveals in store for us. 
 The world building is probably the most fantastic and excellent that I've ever read in any novel, and I'm even including masterworks like Dune and Foundation in this category. More than anything, it's the history and the alternate progressions of thought and development that is so close to our own history that is so amazing. And funny. Screw Occam's Razor. We've got a Rake. ;) 
 Little easter eggs abound in the opening that make so much more sense later in the novel, and on the second read, they're even better because we know what to expect. Causal Domain Shear? What's that? A haircut? OMG. 
 Do *not* expect this to remain a sleepy monk community that has remained cloistered with a few exceptions for 5 thousand years. 
 *Do* expect some truly wonderful and crazy science, philosophy, action and adventure, aliens, space-travel, time and space hacking, immortality, shaolin monks kicking all sorts of ass, horrible world killers, and multiple dimensions. 
 Holy crap, right? 
 It's a damn near perfect story, including great characters, pacing, reveals, science, politics, philosophy, and even religion and poetry. It also continues to blow my mind. How can something this complicated in its entirety read so easily, so effortlessly? But it does, and it's funny as hell, too. 
 I remember my first reading of this getting under my skin and confounding me at the same time. I kept wanting to categorize and pigeonhole it, and with every new hint that came along to tell me that I was going to fail miserably, I slowly got the hint that I just needed to go with the flow, trust the author, and just get fully immersed. There's no other way around it. 
 And there has never been a book quite like this in my life, ever before or ever since. 
 I can't even say that my love of this novel is a case of right place, right time, because with the second read almost eight years after the first, you'd think that I'd have grown as a person. I've certainly read a lot of new books, too. But, alas, this one still packs one hell of a punch. 
 The total-action scenes at the climax had me gasping for air, literally. I actually started crying from just how freaking awesome it all was. :)

 Yes.

Loving parents/parent. Concerned professionals i.e. cops, doctors, lawyer,and or teachers. And a kind stranger. 
 And while Jodi uses a basic formula, her novels are anything but simple or predictable. The other novels I've read have covered stem cell research, teenage date rape, and school shootings. 
 What makes me such a fan of Jodi's novels is that rather than use an omnipotent narrator, her stories are told from the point of view of the various characters. There's always two sides to any given story, and by using this method of story telling, the reader receives compelling and personal arguments from both sides of an issue. Most people would never think of taking the side of an accused rapist, a school shooter, or a cop killer, but Jodi's characters are so fairly drawn, that's exactly what happens. 
 Change of Heart involves many current and important issues. It's core issue is the validity of religion in modern day society. Another theme is the use of capital punishment. And in that vein, the rights of prison inmates are also thoroughly discussed. 
 Some of the main characters includes Maggie an atheist lawyer who begins to find God. Mike a priest who begins to question his faith. And June who goes through quite a number of Changes of Heart. 
 Because Shay, a man on trial for his life, is a keeper of many secrets, and as these secrets are slowly revealed, June and the other characters, are taken on many emmmotional roller coaster rides.

 --------------- 
 Edited 12/06 - Winner of GRCA for fiction!! I guess that even with the polarized reviews, readers overwhelmingly voted for it!! 
 ---------------- 
 First off -- the elephant in the room. Many readers didn't enjoy this book as much as others by the same author. I didn't think twice about rating it 4 stars - really enjoyed. 
 In considering my review, I noted many lower ratings and saw some disappointment expressed. One of the key themes (and I agree with !) is that patience is needed while reading. Yes, the story is about what happened at a barbecue to upset the lives of the 6 adults and 3 children involved. The story goes back and forth between ""before"" and ""after"" the barbecue and the reader is left hungry for details -- what did happen? The what happened unfolds painfully slowly. I tried to guess as I was reading and was not even in the ballpark. 
 Because patience isn't one of my virtues, I had to keep reading. I went so far as to be a bad Buddy Reader and not stick to the agreed schedule. Just had to keep reading to find out about the barbecue.... 
 Why I liked this book 
 I love reading stories with well-developed characters. Sometimes a book may have a great plot, but if I hate all of the characters - I may struggle with enjoying it. 
 This book had an interesting plot (if slow to develop) -- and unique, colorful characters. 
 The adults are very different people at very different places in life. Some of the tidbits that come up are fascinating -- hoarding, exotic dancing, cello playing, seeking fertility treatment, whiling away the hours at a job (instead of working).... Some of the characters are likeable -- others, not so much. I didn't completely connect with any of the characters, but found their backgrounds fascinating -- and told with humor. A crotchety neighbor was also intriguing to read about.... 
 "" Everyone had another sort of life up their sleeve that might have made them happy."" 
 I recommend 
 Truly Madly Guilty 
 to fans of Women's fiction -- especially readers of 
 Liane Moriarty 
 . As other reviewers have noted, some patience is needed as the story of the barbecue unravels. My suggestion is to read this book when you can consume it quickly !

1172,The Rescue,Nicholas Sparks,2000,2005,"When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks; but there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love.
BookPage calls Nicholas Sparks, ""a modern master of fateful love stories,"" and his phenomenal bestsellers- The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, and A Walk to Remember- have made him one of America's most beloved storytellers. Here, in his newest work, Sparks tells a story about making the greatest commitment of all...loving someone forever.
The Rescue
When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks - risks no one else in the department would ever take - to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate.
Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone.
During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love.
In The Rescue Nicholas Sparks weaves his inimitable spell, immersing us in the passions and the surprising complexities of modern relationships-and in doing so, teaching us something about our own.",Fiction,Intermediate,14,1,14,8.071428571428571,12,4.1,143722,5.0,"Opening Line: ""Why had this happened? Why, of all the children was Kyle the one?"" 
 I first read THE RESCUE in 2002 and enjoyed it just as much this time with it's rediscovery. As soon as I opened the first page I was lost, reading continuously for the next 24 hours. Thinking to myself, damn that Nicholas Sparks' he's done it again, sucking me right back into one of the best love stories I've ever read. 
 Due to a horrific childhood trauma volunteer firefighter Taylor McAden is driven to take disturbing heroic risks while on the job, trying to somehow put his world right. He has few friends and all of his past relationships have resulted from rescuing troubled women in one way or another. All of whom he inevitably leaves as soon as they want more from him then he can give. It seems that there's just one leap Taylor can't make; that of allowing himself to fall in love. 
 Denise Holden is a single mother of a handicapped child. Due to a lack of finances she has been forced to move back to her mother's hometown and live in the inherited home. At the moment she's barely scraping by, her son Kyle taking up most of her time, energy and resources. Love is the last thing on Denise's mind as she drives home from her job at the local diner. As fate would have it though a terrible storm hit's the small southern town that night, contriving to bring our couple together. As the storm rages Denise crashes her car and upon regaining consciousness finds herself staring into the handsome face of risk taker extraordinaire Taylor. Before she can acknowledge him as her potential life partner though panic takes over as she realizes that her son is no longer in the car and is feared to be lost in the nearby swamp. 
 I won't be giving anything away by telling you that Taylor rescues both Denise and her son and together they forge into a relationship. But as wonderful as the relationship seems in the beginning it doesn't take long for the cracks to show and the harder Denise tries to help Taylor the more he pulls away. Shutting down emotionally and taking greater and greater risks with the fire department(For a small town they sure have a lot of fires.) 
 As with every Nicholas Sparks' novel we are never guaranteed a HEA which aids in a degree of tension throughout this story. For me the relationship and its sudden decline is so well written that it seemed a page from my own past, tugging at my heart with its familiarity. Taylor is a mystery throughout and the whys of this aren't revealed until the very end. THE RESCUE contains some fabulous secondary characters and you will fall in love with every one of them. It's also full of action, suspense and melodrama. There were a couple of moments when I actually gasped out loud, unbelieving as to what I'd just read. Have some Kleenex handy, this is great yet as always with Sparks bittersweet love story. Cheers!",23.0,1,2866,8569.34,2.99,22,3,3,3
1173,The Boston Girl,Anita Diamant,2014,2014,"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Red Tent and Day After Night, comes an unforgettable coming-of-age novel about family ties and values, friendship and feminism told through the eyes of a young Jewish woman growing up in Boston in the early twentieth century.
Addie Baum is The Boston Girl, born in 1900 to immigrant parents who were unprepared for and suspicious of America and its effect on their three daughters. Growing up in the North End, then a teeming multicultural neighborhood, Addie's intelligence and curiosity take her to a world her parents can't imagine - a world of short skirts, movies, celebrity culture and new opportunities for women. Addie wants to finish high school and dreams of going to college. She wants a career and to find true love.
Eighty-five-year-old Addie tells the story of her life to her twenty-two-year-old granddaughter, who has asked her ""How did you get to be the woman you are today?"" She begins in 1915, the year she found her voice and made friends who would help shape the course of her life. From the one-room tenement apartment she shared with her parents and two sisters, to the library group for girls she joins at a neighborhood settlement house, to her first, disastrous love affair, Addie recalls her adventures with compassion for the naive girl she was and a wicked sense of humor.
Written with the same attention to historical detail and emotional resonance that made Anita Diamant's previous novels bestsellers, The Boston Girl is a moving portrait of one woman's complicated life in twentieth-century America, and a fascinating look at a generation of women finding their places in a changing world.",Fiction,Intermediate,12,6,15,11.583333333333334,7,3.79,53055,3.0,"When Addie Baum's granddaughter asks her how she came to be the woman she is today, Addie embarks on a trek down memory lane. It is now 1985 as she relates her life story to granddaughter Ava, but her story goes back many, many years. Addie, now at the wise age of eighty-five, was born to Jewish-Russian immigrants but was born in America and lived her entire life in Boston. The novel is written in a conversational tone as granddaughter and grandmother bond through the sharing of these vivid memories. Addie's mind is sharp and her storytelling is spirited. 
 Addie had spark and was a real go-getter. This was a struggle for her - her parents had old-fashioned values and often butted heads with Addie. Her mother lived a hard life, did not want to leave her home country, and as a result turned into a bitter woman. Addie could never seem to please her mother and this distressed her but did not crush her spirit. Her mother believed a woman's place was in the home and such phrases as ""Marriage and children are a woman's crown"" were frequently hurled in Addie's direction. When Addie meets Miss Chevalier, her own ambition is stimulated when this forward-looking woman proclaims ""I believe that girls need gumption, too, especially in this day and age. I believe you are a girl with gumption."" So begins Addie's leap into the world of library reading clubs, Saturday clubs, and ""girls camp"" at the Rockport Lodge. Much to her mother's dismay, she joins the ranks of working women. Her mother could grumble all she wanted, but the income from Addie's job made a big impact on the family's financial situation. ""What could she really do? Without what I earned, she would be back to sewing sheets ten hours a day and eating potatoes every night. Money is power, right?"" We learn much about what it was like for a woman earning a living during the years surrounding the 1920s. 
 Addie's story touches on a wide range of topics and historic events including World War I, sexual assault, orphan trains, the flu epidemic, suicide, child labor laws, prohibition, and a slew of others. These subjects were discussed in a manner you would expect between grandmother and granddaughter - with brevity and with the gravity due to such topics, but without too much depth. It was interesting to get a snapshot of such events from Addie's viewpoint. Heartwarming tales of friendship and family were also emphasized, and I really enjoyed those snippets of her narrative. Overall, I would say this is a sweet story, easy to read, and worth your time if you want a light overview of a young woman's life during early 20th century America. I was not truly inspired by the writing itself. Having been a huge fan of Diamant's novel The Red Tent, I perhaps expected a bit more complexity and richness in the prose. However, this read more like a memoir; one which I believe would have been more enjoyable had I listened to rather than read Addie's words. I applauded Addie's independence and enthusiasm for life.",67.0,1,4280,21357.2,4.99,1120,4,2,3
1174,The Storyteller,Jodi Picoult,2013,2012,"Anna and Abel couldn't be more different. They are both seventeen and in their last year of school, but while Anna lives in a nice old town house and comes from a well-to-do family, Abel, the school drug dealer, lives in a big, prisonlike tower block at the edge of town. Anna is afraid of him until she realizes that he is caring for his six-year-old sister on his own. Fascinated, Anna follows the two and listens as Abel tells little Micha the story of a tiny queen assailed by dark forces. It's a beautiful fairy tale that Anna comes to see has a basis in reality. Abel is in real danger of losing Micha to their abusive father and to his own inability to make ends meet. Anna gradually falls in love with Abel, but when his enemies begin to turn up dead, she fears she has fallen for a murderer. Has she? Award-winning author Antonia Michaelis moves in a bold new direction with her latest novel: a dark, haunting, contemporary story that is part mystery, part romance, and part melodrama.",Fiction,Intermediate,8,1,15,9.058823529411764,16,4.1,107,5.0,"""I'm not answering any questions,"" he said, smiling. ""I'm not one of the answering people. I'm the storyteller."" 
 Abel Tannatek is the storyteller. He is a young man hiding an ugly reality behind pretty words and magical happenings. 
 In order to find out what he is hiding, we are forced to slowly watch as the layers of his true self are revealed, one ugly layer at a time. Secrets are the only method of survival in a world where you can count on no one but yourself. Secrets are the only choice you have when you must protect the life of an innocent. 
 Enter Anna. Sheltered, clueless Anna. She has no idea of the darkness and danger outside of her safe little world. 
 It's late, Anna...they'll be waiting for you, at home...in that house where the air is always blue...they'll be worried. 
 A chance meeting between the school's drug dealer and an innocent, sheltered student came about because of a lost doll. Had Anna not found the doll, she would have carried on her life as usual. There would be no danger, no mystery, no killing for her to know about. One might say that finding the doll was the worst thing that could have happened to her. I would disagree. 
 Abel is a broken human being. He's broken to the point of ill repair, yet Anna still sees something in him that's worth saving. As we see Abel through Anna's eyes, we are shown just how much a person will endure in order to spare a life so precious to him - the life of a tiny little girl in a pink jacket. 
 Abel and Anna bond through time shared as Abel spins wonderful fairytales into existence for his younger sister. Real life becomes the backdrop for the fantasy. Characters in reality become characters in the story. A mystery starts to unfold as characters in the story become bigger players in crimes which start taking place in the real world. Who is the killer? Why does Abel seem to have so much to hide? Why are other people interested in what Abel and Anna are up to? 
 I can't divulge much without going into spoiler territory. The Storyteller is so beautifully written. The depth of character and layers of detail are heart-breakingly intricate. After I finished, I was left with a few different emotions. Anger and sadness were probably the two most prominent, but I can't say that I have any regrets reading this book. I had a hard time putting my reader down because the story of Abel and Anna was such a pull. 
 As for the character flaws...I suppose I should address those. Both Abel and Anna disappointed me in a way because of their actions, yet I felt as if their actions made them more real. Abel was abused, so he had no other experience to draw from in learning how to interact with others. Anna had an empty but satisfactory life and she craved more than her own existence inside of a pretty box. Abel was able to give her something she'd never had before and because of this, she was quick to forgive at times when others wouldn't.

Anne of Cleves: She runs from her tiny country, her hateful mother, and her abusive brother to a throne whose last three occupants are dead. King Henry VIII, her new husband, instantly dislikes her. Without friends, family, or even an understanding of the language being spoken around her, she must literally save her neck in a court ruled by a deadly game of politics and the terror of an unpredictable and vengeful king. Her Boleyn Inheritance: accusations and false witnesses. Katherine Howard: She catches the king's eye within moments of arriving at court, setting in motion the dreadful machine of politics, intrigue, and treason that she does not understand. She only knows that she is beautiful, that men desire her, that she is young and in love--but not with the diseased old man who made her queen, beds her night after night, and killed her cousin Anne. Her Boleyn Inheritance: the threat of the axe. Jane Rochford: She is the Boleyn girl whose testimony sent her husband and sister-in-law to their deaths. She is the trusted friend of two threatened queens, the perfectly loyal spy for her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, and a canny survivor in the murderous court of a most dangerous king. Throughout Europe, her name is a byword for malice, jealousy, and twisted lust. Her Boleyn Inheritance: a fortune and a title, in exchange for her soul. The Boleyn Inheritance is a novel drawn tight as a lute string about a court ruled by the gallows and three women whose positions brought them wealth, admiration, and power as well as deceit, betrayal, and terror.

1179,The Heart Of The Matter,Graham Greene,1948,2004,"Scobie is a highly principled officer in a war-torn West African state. When he is passed over for promotion he is forced to borrow money to send his despairing wife away on a holiday.
In her absence he falls hopelessly in love with Helen, a young widow, and his life is transformed by the experience. With a duty to repay his debts and an inability to distinguish between love, pity, and responsibilty to others and to God, Scobie moves inexorably to his final damnation.
The terrifying description of a man's awe of the Church and the ability to portray human motive and to convey such a depth of suffering make The Heart of the Matterone of Graham Greene's most enduring, tragic novels.",Fiction,Intermediate,16,3,16,7.875,6,3.98,19450,4.0,"Four stars, because of the quality of the writing. But I am going to disagree with the label that goes with it, that of ""really liked it."" Because I did not. I feel no affection for this book, and I doubt that I will ever re-read it for many reasons that I will state below. But for those just reading this to get a quick glance about whether they should read it or not: you should, in short. It is worth it. I just would not expect to fall in love. 
 The book focuses on Major Scobie, a policeman in a British colony of West Africa, where Greene himself spent some time. It's set during WWII, which serves to set up the mood of distrust, fragility and vague apprehension that is to haunt the novel and our hero. Major Scobie is a Catholic, and he is married to a shallow, mild horror of a woman named Louise. Insert her unhappiness, his distance, another woman, another man, and you have your novel right there. Those are the basics. Okay, now I can move forward with this. 
 The book is essentially a character study of Major Scobie. And in that function, it is incredibly thorough, and makes sure to search into every area of his soul, several times over. We really do see the man laid naked in front of us. Which is appropriate, given that he's meant to be Christ figure (and casts himself in that role several times.). Even one of the priests says that ""when people have a problem they go to you, not to me,"" and bemoans the fact that priests are not as useful as policemen. It's an interesting thought, but in any case. To me, he was an embodiment of abstract Catholic virtues, set out in one man, going about life as the Catholic Church would have you do. This made real sense to me for the first part of the novel, where Scobie is deconstructed very well, and Greene's conceit was quite effective, I thought. He shows us the difference between living your life as a man and living your life as an abstract virtue. Scobie stays untouched by the animal side of humans, the love, the anger, all vice ridden emotions found in the world that are not learned, but come from within. We do not see him exhibit any of these emotions. And honestly, you sort of dislike him for it. He is inhuman, which drives his wife and everyone who knows him crazy, and honestly, it drove me a little crazy too. But. I appreciated it as a message about living in the world rather than living apart from it, untouched by it. Scobie's major motivation is pity and compassion, which is exactly what Catholicism would tell you to do. But it seems so distant, so resigned, that its rather awful. You end in pitying Scobie as much as you do the clearly inferior characters around him. Or at least, I did. Graham Greene peppers this study with a great many insightful observations about death and the attachment that we really have for people, and what love really is. 
 **spoiler alert*** 
 Which builds into the second half of the novel, which annoyed the flying fuck out of me, confused me and I'm really not sure if I agree with the premise of it at all. Essentially, Greene has Scobie become involved in an affair with a shipwrecked widow named Helen, who has absolutely no one. It's an incredibly sordid affair like one would expect to see in a soap opera, and Scobie is meant to seem all wrong for the role. He has Scobie motivated by pity for her, has him express that it is the weak, the ugly who demand his allegiance, not the beautiful and the intelligent. So this is what makes him succumb to Helen. And then on top of that, he says that he stays with her out of pity. That it was love in the beginning (which I don't believe, as they never show it at all, but skip forward to the part where he is lamenting how love is over) and then it is about duty and responsibility and keeping her happy because if he left, then she would be in pain, and he doesn't want to cause anybody pain. And then his wife comes back, and everyone tells her about the affair, and then she's in pain. And he can't leave either of them because they need him more than God does. That's a direct quote from him. Which is how he squares it with his sinning conscience, carrying on with the whole thing. And then he kills himself because people who love you forget you the second you die, and then nobody will be in pain anymore, and so he's sacrificing himself for them. I just cannot agree with the whole premise and excuse that Scobie makes for his conduct there. I don't believe he ever knew what love was, I don't believe in his reasoning for why he would have succumbed to Helen in all noble motivations. As a Catholic and a girl who's done it before herself, I can certainly see why you would be attracted to someone out of pity. Why you would feel love for people who need you. Fine. But there were many other ways to help Helen other than screwing her, sir. I don't buy that such a distant guy would have ""fallen in love"" due to pity. I buy that he stays with his wife out of pity and responsibility. I don't buy the whole affair, so I can't believe in his moral dilemma. Helen is painted as such an awful whore character I cannot believe why he would have been there at all. (We'll get to that in a second.) Then he goes screaming to God over and over again. I get the penchant for drama. I'm Catholic. Yes, it was interesting to try to see a man live exactly as the Church would tell him, and still to be a human being. But I don't buy that it happened to Scobie. I just hate the whole sordid interlude. I know I'm supposed to hate that its so sordid. But I just think that he made Scobie a much less interesting character throughout it, and everyone else involved were mere representations of what he needed to progress along his moral dilemma, not real people. 
 But. Given that. The last few chapters where he methodically plans his suicide, tries to save everyone the pain around him, quietly goes about his business, and the meditation on what it is like to know that you are leaving the world... that was good. That was heartbreaking. It was that effective quiet whisper of endless pain that I just thought was incredibly skillful and well done. 
 Okay, I really need to talk about what really offended me in this book though: the terrible misogyny. The characters in this book are horrific. There is an extremely strong Madonna/whore complex that runs throughout it, and is represented by the cardboard cutouts that are Louise and Helen. These women are represented exactly as a man who knew nothing about women but what he read in books would represent them as. Grasping, shallow, bitter, angry, small, but with amazing flashes of insight that awe men!.. and yet they are so childish at the same time, so fragile!.. and then they are so stupid the next second. I hated all the women in this book, and I'm pretty sure Graham Greene did, too. I hated that Louise and Helen weren't women, weren't people, but were mere representations of his moral dilemmas, one dimensional harpies who enacted him scenes, had emotional fits, and generally made his life a living hell. Poor baby man who only wanted peace, but no no, these screeching women just insist upon ruining his life! Women are the root of all evil. If it weren't for them, Scobie would be a perfect Christ angel! No wonder Greene converted to Catholicism, if this was his opinion of women. The Church agrees wholeheartedly. Women must be madonnas who look after your home, to be worshipped, who look after your spiritual well being, and stick by their men when they are unfaithful- i.e: Louise. Or they are lost souls who are ready to fuck the first man who comes by when their hero does not support them- like Helen. They have no inner strength of their own except in those first meetings that drew our hero to them, before they became harpies, like all the rest of women are! The two girls were virtually indistinguishable in their manner sometimes. Maybe that's why I just couldn't get into Scobie's dilemma. The women involved made me want to barf, and his bad taste in them, and his opinions of them as people just revolted me just as much. 
 End opinion: Graham Greene's writing: good, elegant, with quiet insight. Graham Greene's misogyny: godawful.",39.0,1,4104,24582.96,5.99,603,4,3,2

 I mean LOTS better because I really had a pretty horrible time while reading this one. In case you too have spent decades ignoring Koontz, here's the lowdown of what Watchers is about. We start with Travis, a supposed former Delta Force member who must have suffered some severe head trauma or something that made him no longer be awesome. Then we meet Bella Swan Nora. Poor Nora is a special snowflake who was forced to live as a recluse by her crazy ass aunt. Now that evil Aunty has finally kicked the bucket, Nora can let her freak flag fly. Ha! Not really. Nora can pretty much only drone on and on and on and on about how difficult things were for her while Travis tells her how much she is smart, she is kind and she is important. (I would like it to be on the record that I will gladly volunteer as tribute to deliver the bitchslapping to Nora that she sooooooo deserves.) Finally, we get to meet the star of the show - a/k/a the smartest pooch ever grown in a lab. No offense el doggito, but there can only be one Einstein . . . 
 Anywho, the whole story is about how Travis finds supermutt and then finds Nora and they fall into instalovey loveytimes and discover that Einstein is a real Einstein all while trying to keep it on the downlow that they have the dog everyone and their . . well dog is looking for while trying to avoid an abomination that was also created by the government known as ""The Outsider"" and not to mention not get whacked by a mafia hitman.

---Ken Bruen, author of The Dramatist
""'Jumpers,' McCallum was saying. 'Jumpers are---well, in my experience jumpers are always badly disturbed. They choose to jump because it's so violent.'""
The body of Niall Howley, a young man with golden hair, is found at the base of the Telstra Tower---the famed communications tower atop Canberra's Black Mountain. Local authorities are content to accept Niall's death as a straightforward suicide. But his apparent ""suicide note"" leaves many unanswered questions.
The note is an image on Niall's computer screen---a digitalized image of himself sprawled at the bottom of cliff . . . an exact replica of the positioning of his body as it was found near the Telstra Tower. Desperate for answers, and fearing murder, his mother seeks out the help of Sandra Mahoney, a computer crime consultant.
Niall had been---until recently---an integral member in a role-playing internet game---and his suicide turns out to be bizarre echo of his own character's death. Niall's death, and its connection to the fate of his internet character force Mahoney to reexamine every angle.
While juggling her own baby daughter, a Russian lover, a needy dog, and a plaguing ex-husband, Sandra races across the globe in pursuit of truth on behalf of a mother who wants to know how a game killed her son. And finds that the threads of truth and illusion can easily wind into a game of manipulation and deceit.
Australian author Dorothy Johnston returns with the second book featuring Inspector Sandra Mahoney; in a thrilling and intelligent mystery that searches for one mother's truth.

The white tower with its viewing platforms looks like a giant hypodermic needle on top of the Black Mountain. The police assumed that the victim was suicidal. Niall was addicted to a role-playing Internet game, and his death resembled the death of his character in the Castle of the Heroes game. But as Sandra investigates Niall's life, she discovers he was also having troubles at work where he was a radiotherapist. Controlling parents, and a breakup with his girlfriend were additional problems. Was Niall's death a suicide or a murder? 
 Sandra works to solve the mystery with her detective efforts on two fronts--interviewing his coworkers at the hospital, and trying to unravel the relationships in the cyberworld.

Henry's fight against self-doubt threatens to ruin his future. College president Guert Affenlight, a longtime bachelor, has fallen unexpectedly and helplessly in love.

Because I'd keep adding them if I could, I loved ""The Art of Fielding"" that much. Truly, I didn't want this novel to come to an end. Last night, I put the book down with 30 pages left. I honestly thought, ""I want one more day to delve into this world."" But then, 20 minutes later, there I was, picking it back up to reach its final page (and discovering a wholy satisfying resolution, which rarely happens for me with most books). 
 This is one of those novels where the characters don't just live on the page. They live WITH you. Here I was, book nowhere in sight, and yet I still found myself at points of my day, wondering what Henry and Schwartz and Pella were doing at that very moment. The hype for this one? TOTALLY WORTH IT. 
 And to say ""The Art of Fielding"" is a book about baseball is to say ""Friday Night Lights"" is a TV show about football. Yes, yes, the book's protagonist is short stop (and baseball phenom) Henry Skrimshander. Yes, there are plenty of scenes that involve the diamond and batting cages (and a central plot point that involves Henry's first-ever errant throw). But it's SO much more than that so don't let all the sports talk dissuade you from reading it. Because wrapped up in all those baseball analogies are the universal themes of suffering and failure and that age-old question of ""What am I doing with my life?"" It may be a stretch for some, but for me, this is as good as it gets in earning that rare title of Great American Novel. 
 Finally, my love for ""Art"" may very well be jaded but that's only because I've learned so much about how it came to be. Chad Harbach spent NINE years laboring over this, his first-ever novel. NINE YEARS. Only to go from a poor guy with debt collectors after him to landing a book contract worth more than $600,000.

 Wow! This book was heavy. I just can't think of a better word to sum up how I feel after finishing this. I'm glad I spaced it out instead of devouring it like I wanted to initially. I've seen many people torn on this book and I understand why; it is EXTREMELY graphic and disturbing. Content and descriptions. I know some of the subjects are triggers for many people, especially women. For me, I felt the extreme graphic violence was necessary to put the power behind the punch of the storyline. I have felt lately that nothing really ""shocks"" me in a book anymore, almost like I've read too many graphic stories. This one was different. 
 The plot is connecting the stories of 2 young women who have gone missing decades apart- Julia Carroll and Anna Kilpatrick. Without giving too much away, the journey is told from the viewpoint of Julia's two remaining sisters- Lydia and Claire, while inserting occasional diary entries from their father, Sam Carroll. 
 I loved the layout of how the story was told; the diary entries interwoven between chapters of the current storyline. I had to go back once to reread because it was so clever. I think we can all agree whether we like her brutal style or not that Karin Slaughter is an excellent storyteller and master of her craft. I'm an avid fan but am willing to admit that in her previous standalone, Cop Town while a great story, had a bit of excess descriptive fluff IMO. I was pleased to see this one didn't seem to have that; I felt every word was needed. I found myself literally holding my breath and sitting upright at times. 
 I felt she did a good job relaying the anguish of a family who has lost a child. A loss this deep affects everyone and it literally tore them apart. I did feel it a little hard to connect with Lydia/Claire at times and I really would have liked to have seen a little more development with Rick and Dee. One of my favorite chunks of the book was near the end with Helen and Claire as we are reaching the climax of the action; I felt this was the most well written part of the entire book. 
 Overall, I wavered between giving this one 4-5 stars and ended up rounding up. I felt this book was extremely well written, the story kept my attention constantly-this is the definition of a suspenseful thriller. While the graphic violence was extremely disturbing, I felt it did not distract me from the story (personally) but can understand why it would have for anyone. Overall, if you are a Slaughter fan, I would HIGHLY recommend. If you are new to her as an author, I would recommend starting with Blindsighted in the Grant County series.",209.0,1,2916,5802.84,1.99,952,3,1,3

Addie Baum is The Boston Girl, born in 1900 to immigrant parents who were unprepared for and suspicious of America and its effect on their three daughters. Growing up in the North End, then a teeming multicultural neighborhood, Addie's intelligence and curiosity take her to a world her parents can't imagine - a world of short skirts, movies, celebrity culture and new opportunities for women. Addie wants to finish high school and dreams of going to college. She wants a career and to find true love.
Eighty-five-year-old Addie tells the story of her life to her twenty-two-year-old granddaughter, who has asked her ""How did you get to be the woman you are today?"" She begins in 1915, the year she found her voice and made friends who would help shape the course of her life. From the one-room tenement apartment she shared with her parents and two sisters, to the library group for girls she joins at a neighborhood settlement house, to her first, disastrous love affair, Addie recalls her adventures with compassion for the naive girl she was and a wicked sense of humor.

It is now 1985 as she relates her life story to granddaughter Ava, but her story goes back many, many years. Addie, now at the wise age of eighty-five, was born to Jewish-Russian immigrants but was born in America and lived her entire life in Boston. The novel is written in a conversational tone as granddaughter and grandmother bond through the sharing of these vivid memories. Addie's mind is sharp and her storytelling is spirited.

Addie could never seem to please her mother and this distressed her but did not crush her spirit. Her mother believed a woman's place was in the home and such phrases as ""Marriage and children are a woman's crown"" were frequently hurled in Addie's direction. When Addie meets Miss Chevalier, her own ambition is stimulated when this forward-looking woman proclaims ""I believe that girls need gumption, too, especially in this day and age. I believe you are a girl with gumption."" So begins Addie's leap into the world of library reading clubs, Saturday clubs, and ""girls camp"" at the Rockport Lodge. Much to her mother's dismay, she joins the ranks of working women. Her mother could grumble all she wanted, but the income from Addie's job made a big impact on the family's financial situation. ""What could she really do? Without what I earned, she would be back to sewing sheets ten hours a day and eating potatoes every night. Money is power, right?"" We learn much about what it was like for a woman earning a living during the years surrounding the 1920s. 
 Addie's story touches on a wide range of topics and historic events including World War I, sexual assault, orphan trains, the flu epidemic, suicide, child labor laws, prohibition, and a slew of others. These subjects were discussed in a manner you would expect between grandmother and granddaughter - with brevity and with the gravity due to such topics, but without too much depth. It was interesting to get a snapshot of such events from Addie's viewpoint. Heartwarming tales of friendship and family were also emphasized, and I really enjoyed those snippets of her narrative. Overall, I would say this is a sweet story, easy to read, and worth your time if you want a light overview of a young woman's life during early 20th century America. I was not truly inspired by the writing itself. Having been a huge fan of Diamant's novel The Red Tent, I perhaps expected a bit more complexity and richness in the prose. However, this read more like a memoir; one which I believe would have been more enjoyable had I listened to rather than read Addie's words. I applauded Addie's independence and enthusiasm for life.",67.0,1,4280,21357.2,4.99,1120,4,3,3
1187,Summer Sisters,Judy Blume,1998,2006,"In the summer of 1977, Victoria Leonard's world changed forever---when Caitlin Somers chose her as a friend. Dazzling, reckless Caitlin welcomed Vix into the heart of her sprawling, eccentric family, opening doors to a world of unimaginable privilege, sweeping her away to vacations on Martha's Vineyard, a magical, wind-blown island where two friends became summer sisters...
Now, years later, Vix is working in New York City. Caitlin is getting married on the Vineyard. And the early magic of their long, complicated friendship has faded. But Caitlin has begged Vix to come to her wedding, to be her maid of honor. And Vix knows that she will go--for the friend whose casual betrayals she remembers all too well. Because Vix wants to understand what happened during that last shattering summer. And, after all these years, she needs to know why her best friend--her summer sister--still has the power to break her heart...",Fiction,Intermediate,22,2,15,6.090909090909091,13,3.83,74288,5.0,"I found this book at the library, and since I loved Judy Blume as a child, I wanted to test one of the books she wrote for adults. I never could have expected a story so involving and complex. The characters come to life on the pages, and the storyline is brilliant in its everyday commonness. 
 Summer Sisters follows the lives of Caitlyn Somers and Victoria Leonard, two unlikely girls from different social backgrounds. Caitlin invites Victoria to stay the summer with her and her father who lives in Martha's Vineyard; shy Victoria can't imagine why a girl so glamorous as Caitlin would want to be friend someone as boring as herself. The two of them form a complex friendship of love and rivalry that spans from the 1970s to the 1990s. 
 These girls share moments of soaring loyalty and heartbreaking betrayal, and I was glued from the very first page. The settings are so real, part of them I could have plucked from my own childhood. This is a truly wonderful book for anyone who loves reading epics, or stories of friendship that takes place in times of joy and times of tragedy. 
 Although this book came out in 2001 (I believe), I am just now reading it. Oh, how I wish I'd found it sooner! Summer Sisters is one of the best of the best from my reading pool of 2007. I highly recommend this book. 
 [Editing to add this tidbit for writerly people interested in craft. Summer Sisters demonstrates foreshadowing done very well. It's one of my favorites, and I keep coming back to it as an example when discussing foreshadowing with friends and in workshops.]",74.0,1,36504,266844.24,7.31,794,5,4,5
1188,The Interestings,Meg Wolitzer,2013,2013,"The Interestings explores the meaning of talent; the nature of envy; the roles of class, art, money, and power; and how all of it can shift and tilt precipitously over the course of a friendship and a life.
The summer that Nixon resigns, six teenagers at a summer camp for the arts become inseparable. Decades later the bond remains powerful, but so much else has changed. In The Interestings, Wolitzer follows these characters from the height of youth through middle age, as their talents, fortunes, and degrees of satisfaction diverge.
The kind of creativity that is rewarded at age fifteen is not always enough to propel someone through life at age thirty; not everyone can sustain, in adulthood, what seemed so special in adolescence. Jules Jacobson, an aspiring comic actress, eventually resigns herself to a more practical occupation and lifestyle. Her friend Jonah, a gifted musician, stops playing the guitar and becomes an engineer. But Ethan and Ash, Jules's now-married best friends, become shockingly successful--true to their initial artistic dreams, with the wealth and access that allow those dreams to keep expanding. The friendships endure and even prosper, but also underscore the differences in their fates, in what their talents have become and the shapes their lives have taken.
Wide in scope, ambitious, and populated by complex characters who come together and apart in a changing New York City, The Interestings explores the meaning of talent; the nature of envy; the roles of class, art, money, and power; and how all of it can shift and tilt precipitously over the course of a friendship and a life.",Fiction,Intermediate,4,11,13,11.75,13,3.54,77741,4.0,"I'm not certain what 44 looks like, other than what I'm presented with in the mirror each morning. The Social Security Life Expectancy calculator informs me that I've lived half my anticipated span. The tired maxim encourages me not to think of the years in my life, but the life in my years. 
 Now that I'm marooned in middle age for a spell, I've been thinking an awful lot about the life in the years ahead of and behind me. Have I achieved something of value in my work, my relationships? Is what I do enough to sustain me intellectually and emotionally for the next forty-four years? Do I measure up to my peers? Am I happy? Am I interesting? This quest for fulfillment and self-actualization is the premise of Meg Wolitzer's sprawling, cracking good novel The Interestings. 
 In the summer of '74, Julie Jacobson, a middle class average achiever from a non-descript upstate New York town, earns a spot at an exclusive arts camp in New England. She is selected to enter the inner circle of the five coolest kids in camp, each a precocious, urbane specimen bred in the hipness of New York City. Julie becomes Jules and we follow her and those five other teenagers for the next thirty years. 
 Jules is obsessed with the self-dubbed The Interestings -the talented and/or privileged people to whom she devotes so much emotional energy. The cult of personalities made me squeamish at times--I wanted her to walk away from the past and create a life of her own. But her devotion to their supposed ideal reveals one of the truths of human nature--we hang onto the golden coming-of-age memories, hoping those few perfect moments of childhood will carry us through the disappointment of growing up. 
 It took me a long time to track on the Jules Vibe. I never quite believed in her intimate friendship with Ash Wolf, the faerie child around whose axis the group of friends spins. Nor did I fully embrace Ethan's constancy of passion for her. She just wasn't, ironically, that interesting. Even her physical presence remained shadowy for me. The others I could picture perfectly--lumbering, awkward Ethan; delicate, perfectly formed Ash; bombshell Cathy; finely etched, beautiful Jonah with his sweep of long, dark hair; golden God turned bloated addict Goodman. But Jules, other than her unruly hair, remained indistinct. 
 Yet, as she matured, growing into her role as friend, counselor, wife and mother, Jules begins to take shape. She became the character I most wanted to get stuck in the middle of a book with. Which is the genius of Wolitzer's narrative--the novel's most enigmatic character becomes its core strength. 
 Not that you'll get stuck in this book. Despite its length and scope, The Interestings impels the reader with sparkling dialogue and description. I did tread water with some lengthy expository and flashback episodes, but it easily becomes one of those books you just can't set down. 
 If you say you don't compare your external successes and failures (e.g. material possessions, presumed income, job, weight, health, marital status, kids' college admissions, job prospects) with your circle of peers, I say ""more power to you."" Forgive me if I don't believe you. Meg Wolitzer probably wouldn't believe you, either. It's what we do, we flawed, insecure, fickle humans. We're hard-wired to want what we ain't got. 
 But we can learn to accept what we've been given. Do The Interestings? Read and find out. 
 I'm five years too young to fall within the brackets of the Baby Boomer generation (cut-off birth year is 1964), and ten years younger than the main characters of The Interestings, but I can relate to many of the novel's cultural reference points and Jules Jacobson's feeling that she just missed out on the badge of cultural honor bestowed those who came of age in the late '60s. 
 I've walked away from traditional success a few times, always choosing the interesting over expected. Perhaps because I fear the fall from lofty heights will be harder to recover from than the soft bounce of relative obscurity. Perhaps I'm just lazy.

1189,Heart-Shaped Box,Joe Hill,2007,2007,"Aging, self-absorbed rock star Judas Coyne has a thing for the macabre -- his collection includes sketches from infamous serial killer John Wayne Gacy, a trepanned skull from the 16th century, a used hangman's noose, Aleister Crowley's childhood chessboard, etc. -- so when his assistant tells him about a ghost for sale on an online auction site, he immediately puts in a bid and purchases it.
The black, heart-shaped box that Coyne receives in the mail not only contains the suit of a dead man but also his vengeance-obsessed spirit. The ghost, it turns out, is the stepfather of a young groupie who committed suicide after the 54-year-old Coyne callously used her up and threw her away. Now, determined to kill Coyne and anyone who aids him, the merciless ghost of Craddock McDermott begins his assault on the rocker's sanity.",Fiction,Intermediate,7,6,16,11.571428571428571,13,3.82,66865,3.0,"When aging, retired rocker Judas Coyne buys a ghost on-line, he gets more than he bargained for, as the ghost, which arrives by way of a used suit in a heart-shaped box, is no benign spirit. I was most reminded of Freddie Krueger, as the hostile ghost sets out to destroy Coyne and all those he holds dear. I was not ecstatic early on about the premise, as I believed it was insufficient to sustain a book of this length. Although I have read better horror books, this one turned out well enough. What makes it special though is that Joe Hill just happens to be the son of none other than Stephen King. The apple remains in the orchard. The guy has talent, and I expect there will be much more product in the years to come as he follows in daddy's footsteps.

1190,Different Seasons,Stephen King,1982,1995,"A ""hypnotic"" (The New York Times Book Review) collection of four novellas from Stephen King bound together by the changing of seasons, each taking on the theme of a journey with strikingly different tones and characters.
""The wondrous readability of his work, as well as the instant sense of communication with his characters, are what make Stephen King the consummate storyteller that he is,"" hailed the Houston Chronicle about Different Seasons.
This gripping collection begins with ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,"" in which an unjustly imprisoned convict seeks a strange and startling revenge--the basis for the Best Picture Academy Award-nominee The Shawshank Redemption. Next is ""Apt Pupil,"" the inspiration for the film of the same name about top high school student Todd Bowden and his obsession with the dark and deadly past of an older man in town. In ""The Body,"" four rambunctious young boys plunge through the facade of a small town and come face-to-face with life, death, and intimations of their own mortality. This novella became the movie Stand By Me. Finally, a disgraced woman is determined to triumph over death in ""The Breathing Method.""",Fiction,Intermediate,32,1,15,7.34375,3,4.34,108352,5.0,Stephen King's best work.

1191,A Death In The Family,James Agee,1957,2012,"In this utterly remarkable novel Karl Ove Knausgaard writes with painful honesty about his childhood and teenage years, his infatuation with rock music, his relationship with his loving yet almost invisible mother and his distant and unpredictable father, and his bewilderment and grief on his father's death. When he becomes a father himself, he must balance the demands of caring for a young family with his determination to write great literature. A Death in the Family is a Proustian exploration of his past, in which Knausgaard creates a universal story of the struggles u great and small u that we all face in our lives. A Death in the Family is a profoundly serious, gripping and hugely readable work written as if the author's very life were at stake.",Fiction,Intermediate,16,9,16,13.6875,1,4.07,143,5.0,"My first impression of Karl Ove Knausgaard came from a black and white photograph published with a review of his book ""A Time For Everything"" in The New York Review of Books. 
 He is seen smoking against the rugged Norwegian landscape, hair disheveled, wearing an old, battered tee-shirt, lost in thought. Completely and unabashedly himself, yet ill at ease. Entirely present, feet deeply rooted in the present moment, yet his mind is clearly in flight, flickering at the surface of his gaze. 
 The striking portrait somehow encompasses all of the qualities of his writing: intense, raw, physical, elusive, inquisitive and elemental. 
 http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archi... 
 What Knausgaard achieves in ""My Struggle"", his mad yet mesmerizing 6-volume autobiographical enterprise, is simply the most ""real"" depiction of the movements of the mind that I have ever read. A life told in its most boring minutiae and its most elemental highs and lows, as it moves from the most mundane to the most transcendent. 
 Knausgaard plays alongside Proust or Virginia Woolf in his desire to encapsulate all of his experience as a human being, a teenager, a son, a friend, a lover, a father but most of all: a writer. But he does it with even more urgency, more radicality, more anger and more modernity. An Everyman of the 21st century with a 17th century temperament. 
 The second volume of this autobiography, which tackles the fire and vagaries of love as well as the deep ambivalences that lie at the heart of domestic life and parenthood, is utterly engrossing. 
 Read him, and listen to him below speak about Book 1, which deals with his youth and the death of his father, and he might very well change the way you look at the world around you and your own reaction to events.

1192,Desperation,Stephen King,1996,1996,"Something is terribly wrong in Desperation, Nevada -- a small mining town just off Route 50 with a played out open pit copper mine. The streets are wind swept and deserted; animals have the run of the town and something horrific is brewing in the now abandoned mine pit. You won't have a good day in Desperation.",Fiction,Intermediate,15,1,16,5.0,1,3.8,1821,3.0,"""Dolls with no little girls around to mind them were sort of creepy under any conditions."" 
 Tak 
 As a constant King reader, I was looking forward to diving into his twisted mindset again, for believe it or not this was my first King book this year and immediately from page one it felt like home. The whole setting for this book lends itself well to the extreme creepy factor from the ghost town in the middle of a desert to the long stretches of highway that just give this unsettling feeling like something bad is about happen. 
 ""You said 'God is cruel' the way a person who's lived his whole life on Tahiti might say 'Snow is cold'. You 
 knew 
 , but you didn't understand."" He stepped close to David and put his palms on the boy's cold cheeks. ""Do you know how cruel your God can be, David. How fantastically cruel?"" 
 The plot revolves around this isolated town called Desperation which is located in Nevada, it seems deserted and the only inhabitant is the sheriff who patrols Highway 50 where a bunch of outsiders will, unfortunately, cross paths with the devil himself. Somehow, they get pulled over for some sort of technicality with the law and are brought to Desperation and all hell breaks loose. 
 My experience reading this polarizing, before starting this I read that the book was too heavy on the religiousness or ""preachy"" and I was still not put off by that because The Stand also drew some inspiration from the Bible and used that to explore the Good vs Evil trope it was done smartly and the characters didn't feel like biblical prophets but when it came to this book it felt like I was literally being talked down at. The plot was steady and the suspense was incredible as one would expect with a King but the second half the religious ideologies overtook the storyline. 
 ""In these silences, something may rise"" 
 The characters had a similar effect with the plot, at the beginning each individual had such a strong presence but they slowly dwindled... The whole idea of free will in regards to religion was touched on but once the characters started losing their own personal belief and started making really dumb decisions my enjoyment level started plummeting. 
 Apart from all that the book is really fast paced, devouring the 700pages in a weeks time and the gore factor was top notch. Exploring addiction and alcoholism was well done as the subject hits close to home for Stephen King. I would definitely still recommend it for the sharp writing and atmosphere but it isn't like my favorite King book, I have read better. Still, you sound check it out if the premise sounds interesting or if you are King addict. 
 I would definitely check out The Regulators to see how the narratives pair together. 
 Have you read it what are your thoughts on it?

 5***** and a 
 In Depression-era Flint, Michigan, 10-year-old Bud Caldwell (BUD, not Buddy) is plucked from the ""home"" to go to a foster family. This will be the third foster home he's been in, and he's not impressed. But he takes his worn, cardboard suitcase with his few but treasured possessions and tries to make the best of it. Before he knows it, he's on the lam, determined to find his own way and sure that the things his Momma left him are clues to his father's identity and whereabouts. 
 I love Bud. He's imaginative, intelligent, resourceful, well-mannered, curious, and ever-hopeful. Once he's decided to find the man he is sure is his father, nothing will stop him. He endures hunger and fear, but also comes across kind-hearted men and women who help him (though he isn't always forthcoming about his goal, and outright lies about his situation more than once). He's also quite the philosopher - having compiled a list of Bud Caldwell's Rules and Thing for Having a Funner Life and Making a Better Liar Out of Yourself. Among my favorites: Rule # 83 - If a Adult Tells You Not to Worry, and You Weren't Worried Before, You Better Hurry Up and Start, 'Cause You're Already Running Late. 
 Curtis doesn't gloss over the difficulties faced by many during the Great Depression, giving the reader a history lesson on the conditions in Hoovervilles across America. But he also shows that with determination, hard work, and compassion people survived the hardships and formed lasting bonds. As an adult, I really appreciated the afterword wherein Curtis explains some of his own family history and suggests, no orders, the reader to ""Go talk to Grandma and Grandpa, Mom and Dad, and other relatives and friends."" 
 James Avery is marvelous performing the audio book. Heck,

 was scared when Bud was in the shed with the ""vampires"" and fish-guards! And at the end, my eyes started that same ""stingy-eyed blinking"" that afflicted Miss Thomas.",15.0,1,2889,11035.98,3.82,980,3,1,1
1196,The Lighthouse,P. D. James,2005,2012,"Shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2012 Shortlisted for New Writer of the Year in the 2012 Specsavers National Book Awards On the outer deck of a North Sea ferry stands Futh, a middle-aged and newly separated man, on his way to Germany for a restorative walking holiday. After an inexplicably hostile encounter with a hotel landlord, Futh sets out along the Rhine. As he contemplates an earlier trip to Germany and the things he has done in his life, he does not foresee the potentially devastating consequences of things not done. ""The Lighthouse,"" Alison Moore's first novel, tells the tense, gripping story of a man trying to find himself, but becoming lost.",Fiction,Intermediate,7,5,13,9.142857142857142,3,3.38,3458,4.0,"This is a story about emptiness; it is a story about how people long for what they do not have, and look for it everywhere and in everyone: it's a story about empty people and empty lives. And in this Moore provides an excellent case study in the characterisation of Futh, a man who embodies an extreme sense of loneliness. 
 It's also about futility and the fruitless nature of such longing. Instead of living in the now and making the most of what we do have the human mind always seeks such impossibilities. This creates a stream of consciousness like feel to some parts of the book. Futh may pick up an item or smell a certain smell and he is drawn back in time, ultimately, relaying his memories and demonstrating how they constantly reassert themselves in his present state. He is unable to move on and escape from the past so he can get on with his life. He has gone on holiday to get over his break-up with his wife, but instead spends the entire trip reminiscing about times gone by. 
 Moore chronicles the life of this sad character, a man rejected by his farther and abandoned by his mother who still seeks some sense of parental love long into his forties. He never got over these early problems in his developmental stages; thus, they are carried through to adulthood. At times it felt like Moore based her character, and his psychological issues, on the Freudian stages of psychosexual development. Futh has developed a strong sense of oedipal complex; he looks for his mother in other women, and especially his wife. She reminds him of his early memories, and he is drawn to the scent that activates his memories. It's why she became frustrated with him, which isn't overly surprising. 
 In his pocket Futh carries the lighthouse, a miniature perfume bottle holder that is his last physical link to his mother. He rubs it in his pocket when he gets nervous. He carries it around with him everywhere and seeks comfort in the caressing of it. It embodies her, a sense of warmth, safety and direction a mother should give to her son. The narrative is interposed with references to this safe-haven, this idealised place or person, which Futh is seeking throughout his life. He becomes a semi-functional being, a man who is deeply socially awkward, incompetent and perhaps even slightly impotent. This longing hangs over his life and prevents him from, essentially, enjoying anything and deriving any sense of success of personal achievement. 
 ""And Futh, looking at the lighthouse, wondered how this could happen--how there could be this constant warning of danger, the taking of all these precautions, and yet still there was all this wreckage."" 
 I think this book is an extremely effective exploration into one man's mind. If anything, Alison Moore shows how early childhood experiences shape a man and linger on for the rest of his life unless he actively attempts to break the cycle. And the ending she leaves us with is utterly open to interpretation, the story echoed on long after I finished reading it. I recommend it highly.",67.0,1,3996,30889.08,7.73,619,3,2,1

 If there is one thing Mo Hayder knows is it to write a book that crawls under your skin. She dares, just like Dennis Lehane can she write in such a way that it's with terror you turn each page. 
 Gone is no exception. Reading about kidnapped children is always terrible and you do not know if Jack Caffery will be able to save the kidnapped girl. Caffery is a brilliant police, but in this book, the kidnapper seems to anticipate every single move the police do, and as more time goes by, the fear grows that they will be too late. 
 Then we have police diver Flea Marley, who lives with the consequences from the previous book, which has consequences for her at work. She does not know that Jack suspects her for a crime she's actually innocent of. Although it's quite logical that he suspects her since he doesn't have the whole picture. Now she decides to search for the kidnapped girl. But, is she really in shape to help out? Or will she only risk her own life? 
 Gone is a tough thriller where the unidentified perpetrator always lurks in the background, and at the end, when Caffery confronts the perpetrator will you still question if everything will end happily...

1198,Different Seasons,Stephen King,1982,1995,"A ""hypnotic"" (The New York Times Book Review) collection of four novellas from Stephen King bound together by the changing of seasons, each taking on the theme of a journey with strikingly different tones and characters.
""The wondrous readability of his work, as well as the instant sense of communication with his characters, are what make Stephen King the consummate storyteller that he is,"" hailed the Houston Chronicle about Different Seasons.
This gripping collection begins with ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,"" in which an unjustly imprisoned convict seeks a strange and startling revenge--the basis for the Best Picture Academy Award-nominee The Shawshank Redemption. Next is ""Apt Pupil,"" the inspiration for the film of the same name about top high school student Todd Bowden and his obsession with the dark and deadly past of an older man in town. In ""The Body,"" four rambunctious young boys plunge through the facade of a small town and come face-to-face with life, death, and intimations of their own mortality. This novella became the movie Stand By Me.

1199,The Lost World,Michael Crichton,1995,1995,"It is now six years since the secret disaster at Jurassic Park, six years since the extraordinary dream of science and imagination came to a crashing end - the dinosaurs destroyed, the park dismantled, the island indefinitely closed to the public.
There are rumors that something has survived....",Fiction,Intermediate,24,1,15,5.416666666666667,10,3.73,84927,2.0,"The Lost World is not a very good book. The story is a slog to start and the characters are very weak. So weak that if any of them had actually been eaten by the constantly hungry dinosaurs I would've been like: shrug. 
 As the story progressed and I waited impatiently to find out: would they actually solve the mystery of the missing Dr Levine and go to the island of dinosaurs--as if there was a chance of that not happening--I was introduced to a series of these weak characters and it then became a struggle to decide who I wanted to be eaten first. 
 Initially I really wanted one or both of the two genius kids to get chomped. Their place in the book was so formulaic, so PC, and so contrived that it marred the over-all story. They were there simply to add some emotion to a flat read. It didn't work since you just knew neither of them would die.(Side note: Every author should kill a main/well liked character every 5 or 6 books just to keep the possibility out there.) 
 The next on my list of those characters who I wished would just get torn to shreds was Richard Levine, who was a know-it-all bore. It would've been good for him to have been killed very early in the book(maybe chapter 4?)--just as long as he didn't linger in his demise. Whenever Levine opened his mouth he would go on and on, until I found myself skimming. 
 Third on my hit-list was Sarah Harding...I mean Dr Sarah Harding(Everyone has PhDs and multiple PhDs and everyone is all so brilliant that it's tiresome.) Though I would have liked to see Sarah become Dino-kibble it wasn't going to happen. She was a female Tarzan and it was a wonder she didn't kill a T-Rex with a spear. Uhg. I get tired of the PC world (Though to be fair the dinosaurs weren't at all scary. In one scene Dr Levine is stalking a T-rex on a bicycle, completely unafraid, which had me wondering: why did they come to rescue him?) 
 Ironically, the only person that I really wanted to live was a character who had died in the first book. For some reason the author resurrects Ian Malcolm. If you remember, Malcolm hated dinosaurs, yet for some reason he tags along on expedition to a dinosaur infested island to find Levine, a man he really doesn't like. It's completely out of character for him and makes no sense. In fact in the first few chapters he's completely against the idea and then pop! He changes his mind with no real reason given. 
 So all the characters suck and this is because they aren't in-depth people with strong desires and motivations, instead they are talking props. They all seemed to sit about either spewing sciencey knowledge or receiving sciencey knowledge; this they take turns at doing. And everyone is a genius, or so we are told. Judging by their actions however, they are a bunch of morons who deserve to be eaten. 
 So much for the characters, how about the story itself? 
 Dinosaurs are scary. Run everyone. Bad guys die. Good guys live. It was a cheap imitation of a good book: Jurassic Park. I wouldn't bother with this sequel.",17.0,1,55728,556722.72,9.99,658,5,5,2

 SWEDISH REVIEW 
 Om det ar nagot Mo Hayder kan sa ar det att skriva bocker som gar under skinnet pa en. Precis som Dennis Lehane sa vagar hon ta ut svangarna och det ar med isande fasa man laser varje sida. 
 Forsvunnen ar inget undantag. Att lasa om kidnappade barn ar hemskt och man vet inte om Jack Caffery kommer att lyckas radda situationen. Caffery ar en lysande polis, men i denna bok sa verkar det som om kidnapparen kan forutse polisen nasta drag och ju mer tiden gar desto mer lutar det at att det ar forsent, att flickan inte kommer att raddas. 
 Sedan har vi polisdykaren Flea Marley, som lever med konsekvenserna fran foregaende bok, vilket stor henne i jobbet. Hon vet inte om att Jack misstanker henne for ett brott som hon faktiskt ar oskyldig till men som i och med det Jack vet om det ter sig logiskt att han misstanker henne. Nu ger hon sig in kampen for att radda den kidnappade flickan. Men ar hon verkligen i form att ta sig an fallet? Kommer hon istallet bara att riskera sitt eget liv? 
 Forsvunnen ar en ruggig thriller dar den okande forovaren hela tiden lurar i bakgrunden och man sitter pa helspand pa slutet nar Caffery konfronterar forovaren. Fragan ar kommer allting att sluta lyckligt?

1203,The Passage,Justin Cronin,2010,2010,"It happened fast. Thirty-two minutes for one world to die, another to be born. ""
First, the unthinkable: a security breach at a secret U.S. government facility unleashes the monstrous product of a chilling military experiment. Then, the unspeakable: a night of chaos and carnage gives way to sunrise on a nation, and ultimately a world, forever altered. All that remains for the stunned survivors is the long fight ahead and a future ruled by fear of darkness, of death, of a fate far worse.
As civilization swiftly crumbles into a primal landscape of predators and prey, two people flee in search of sanctuary. FBI agent Brad Wolgast is a good man haunted by what he s done in the line of duty. Six-year-old orphan Amy Harper Bellafonte is a refugee from the doomed scientific project that has triggered apocalypse. He is determined to protect her from the horror set loose by her captors. But for Amy, escaping the bloody fallout is only the beginning of a much longer odyssey spanning miles and decades towards the time and place where she must finish what should never have begun.
With The Passage, award-winning author Justin Cronin has written both a relentlessly suspenseful adventure and an epic chronicle of human endurance in the face of unprecedented catastrophe and unimaginable danger. Its inventive storytelling, masterful prose, and depth of human insight mark it as a crucial and transcendent work of modern fiction.",Fiction,Intermediate,8,3,14,8.0,4,4.04,87,3.0,"Listening Length: 29 CDs, 36 hrs & 52 mins. 
 Version: Unabridged Audiobook 
 Publisher: Random House Audio 
 Narrated by: Scott Brick (mostly), Adenrele Ojo & Abby Craden (read small passages) 
 I borrowed the audiobook version from my library after seeing it on all sorts of ""best of/must read/best book eva!"" lists. I swear I saw this title repeated so many times in various feeds that the damn thing had been imprinted on my brain and I requested it mindlessly from the library. What I didn't realize though was how long it was until my request came in. Even my librarian commented on the girth of the thing and complained in front of several other patrons that ""I always request the big ones"". Well, that was embarrassing. And it's not even true most of the time. 
 Sheesh, is everyone socially awkward or do I attract this sort of comment? 
 Anyway, where does one even begin with such a tome of a book? It is painfully long and spans nearly a century and features a cast of plenty that made my head spin. It starts out well enough and focuses on the tumultuous early life of a young child named Amy. I really felt for Amy and just as I was getting to know her the book switches gears and outlines a program to develop a race of super humans. Experimental injections are performed on twelve death row inmates and eventually Amy . . . Things go awry (surprise, surprise) and the world as we know it ends when a virus that turns humans into bloodthirsty beasts changes the landscape forever more. 
 Then the book fast forwards, oh almost a hundred years or so, and follows a group of survivors trying to make the best of their world which is still overrun with ""virals"". The First Colony, as they call themselves, live their lives during the day, some of them tucking themselves safely away at night while others keep a lookout for active virals. The virals can't abide sunlight and lights keep them away. But the batteries that allow the lights to function are starting to fail . . . This section of the book pretty much bored the hell out of me. It goes on for hundreds of pages, without too much of anything exciting or engaging happening. We get glimpses into the characters but never truly get to know any of them that well. Too many of these people all blend into one, especially the men who (in this audio version at least) all came across as very similar. They sound similar and there was nothing distinctive about their personalities to help me tell them apart. A few of the women (Sara, Mousami, Elisha) fare a little better. Also, way too many of these First Colony people spend their time lamenting about the fact that they are married to someone but longing for love from another, Um what? Why the heck, in a world where you could be eaten by a viral at any moment, wouldn't you express your feelings to the one you adore and find a little happiness? It didn't make sense and now that I'm finished with the book it still doesn't make sense. I guess people are idiots in the future too. The other thing that didn't make sense was the segregation of the children who are kept oblivious of the dangers of the world and live separately from their families. These people were like sheep, just mindlessly going along with the flow. Why no parents ever stood up and demand change was really unbelievable to me. Wouldn't most parents want to spend every available moment with their child instead of sequestering them with a Teacher until they're eight years old? I just didn't get it and it made me care a lot less about all of them. 
 This review is getting as long as the book so I'll try wrapping it up. The last third does pick up the pace and is actually worth reading. Amy plays a large role in the story. Things all gel together and the big picture is super interesting but the getting there? Not so much. The book is mostly humorless and read in an intensely serious tone by narrator Scott Brick. He does a decent job with the material but at times I completely tuned out without realizing it and had to rewind entire chapters at a time. Now I realize this isn't supposed to be a laugh-fest but a little humor to lighten things up here and there, or even one sarcastic character, would've gone a long way to make the story go down easier for me. And it's all about me, isn't it? I like darkness but this book is too long to be so somber. I realized things were indeed dire when I smiled after a dog viewed a puddle of vomit as an unexpected present. Yeah, I was looking for humor wherever I could get it. 
 I spent nearly two weeks listening to this on audio and I'm relieved it's over. It drained me but not emotionally which is a shame. It was a chore to get through most of it and I probably won't seek out the next one but don't quote me on that . . .",16.0,1,795,3172.05,3.99,141,2,3,3
1204,Prodigal Summer,Barbara Kingsolver,2000,2001,"Prodigal Summerweaves together three stories of human love within a larger tapestry of lives inhabiting the forested mountains and struggling small farms of southern Appalachia.
From her outpost in an isolated mountain cabin, Deanna Wolfe, a reclusive wildlife biologist, watches a den of coyotes that have recently migrated into the region. She is caught off-guard by a young hunter who invades her most private spaces and confounds her self-assured, solitary life. On a farm several miles down the mountain, Lusa Maluf Landowski, a bookish city girl turned farmer's wife, finds herself unexpectedly marooned in a strange place where she must declare or lose her attachment to the land that has become her own. And a few more miles down the road, a pair of elderly feuding neighbors tend their respective farms and wrangle about God, pesticides, and the possibilities of a future neither of them expected.
Over the course of one humid summer, these characters find their connections to one another and to the flora and fauna with whom they share a place.

One school consider this the weakest of the seven volumes. They can't see what the point is. A huge flashback - stuff that has already happened - how does that advance the plot? I call these people the Rolands. The other school considers this to be the finest book of the series, they loved every page of the thing. They think the huge flash-back was a wonderful story in itself which develops a greater understanding of what motivates the gunslinger and where he came from. I call these people the Oys. 
 I'm an Oy in this regard. Oys think the books are about the journey not the destination. Rolands think the destination (tower) is all-important and that any step to the side or backwards is an abomination. 
 I believe the message of this series (slight spoiler) is that we should be Oys rather than Rolands 
 This is King at his best. Wonderfully rich characters and setting. Great imagination, brilliant description, scary evil, and the tension rising relentlessly with stakes that you're made to value. 
 It's been a while since I read this, so I won't comment in more detail. 
 For me, not only is it the best volume but each successive volume after this is a little less good. However, I can't attribute this to the author's age/decline as I also rated The Wind Through The Keyhole very highly, and that's a nominal volume 8 which sits around 4.5 in truth and is set (IIRC) in the period a little after that covered by the flashback that occupies most of Wizard and Glass.

1206,Lullaby,Chuck Palahniuk,2002,2003,"Carl Streator is a reporter investigating Sudden Infant Death Syndrome for a soft-news feature. After responding to several calls with paramedics, he notices that all the dead children were read the same poem from the same library book the night before they died. It's a 'culling song' - an ancient African spell for euthanising sick or old people. Researching it, he meets a woman who killed her own child with it accidentally. He himself accidentally killed his own wife and child with the same poem twenty years earlier. Together, the man and the woman must find and destroy all copies of this book, and try not to kill every rude sonofabitch that gets in their way. Lullabyis a comedy/drama/tragedy. In that order. It may also be Chuck Palahniuk's best book yet.",Fiction,Intermediate,3,7,15,10.666666666666666,2,3.73,67526,3.0,"When you pick up a Chuck Palahniuk book you know that you are going to plunge ever-so-briefly into a raging torrent of absurdity, horror so whimsical that you laugh even as you cringe, and insightful looks at contemporary living. It seems a cheap shot to call his work formulaic, but once you've read through 6 or 7 of his books, the pattern emerges and you have a vague idea of what to expect. 
 It was Lullaby that finally brought this realization home to me. You have the protagonist, a man who seems like the picture of upstanding normality at first glance but who is eventually revealed to have a dark secret hidden in his past. You have the more experienced secondary character who helps to drive the story forward by slowly revealing some answers to the mystery. Then you have the comical minor characters, the latter-day Rosencratz and Guildenstern (or the R2D2 and C3PO if you want to take it that far) if you will, who play an important roll in the advancement of events but who also provide the brilliant moments of macabre hilarity. At some point they will all go on a roadtrip and Palahniuk will ruminate on the state of human existence at the turn of the 21st Century. 
 And so it goes for Lullaby. Features reporter Carl Streator is assigned to report on crib death for a mid-size Portland newspaper. As he visits site after site of these tragic deaths, he notices the constant appearance of a book of children's poems all laying open to Page 27. It appears that prior to dying the infants had all been read this particular poem. Being the thorough investigative reporter that he is, Streator traces crib deaths in his area back over 20 years until he comes across Helen Hoover Boyle, a Realtor who specializes in selling (and reselling and reselling again) haunted houses to unsuspecting clients, who may know the reason why this particular poem seems to kill. It's not long before Streator, Helen, her assistant Mona (known as Mulberry in the Wiccan circles in which she travels) and Mona's boyfriend Oyster embark on a roadtrip across the country to track down every copy of this culling poem to protect the sleeping infants of the world from inadvertent death. 
 Like I said it's formulaic, but this just makes it easier to focus on the odd details that Palahniuk likes to toss into the mix. Oyster's long narrations about the history of invasive foreign plants and how this can be used as a means to understand the cannibalistic psyche of modern man, an EMT who learns the culling poem so that he can kill fashion models and then have sex with their dead bodies, the twisted history of antique furniture- they all add together to form a novel that, while not spectacular, definitely envelops you and reminds you why it is that Palahniuk stands out as one of the best contemporary authors of today.",27.0,1,53352,426282.48,7.99,671,5,2,1

Publishers Weekly,Fiction,Intermediate,10,5,10,8.2,10,4.12,107,5.0,"Voyage reads like Whitman and Melville in a drinking contest, recognizing the attraction and dangers of the sea, the highs and lows that come with living on your own terms. Hayden had lived most of his life on a boat. When he lived in France, he lived on a boat in various docks. His love for the sea began at Long Wharf in Boston and Sausalito is where Hayden set his last anchor. NY-born and patrician Bogart had a schooner named Santana, and Hayden had his schooner Wanderer. There is no doubt that Hayden was a flawed man of Lear contradictions: he drank, railed against many things, but it seemed that he distrusted the things that came easy to him...such as acting. He disliked the Hollywood factories for creating illusion; politicians, for perpetuating other illusions and; railed against what he was seeing America become. He was outspoken about his political activism, his drinking and occasional drug use in his interviews with Tom Synder, where he looks like the future Keith Richards, but betrays himself as a writer. Hayden lived his life at odds with the `American dream,' climbing up and down the ladder of success several times over. He was a nonconformist who believed in the examined life. It is impossible not to notice the pattern that just as he was about to touch the brass ring he would walk away; but in the writing he is simply majestic, poetic, and provocative. I'd argue that his prose rivals with the best of the twentieth century's best writers.",4.0,1,2733,8171.670000000001,2.99,24,2,3,3

 THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS 
 It was kinda hard to decide the rating on this novel. 
 If I'd think only on the raw reading experience, I would say that it was a 3-star material. 
 However, I had to ponder about the whole additional info and further development of characters compared with my experience with the film adaptation (which certainly is one of my favorite horror films). So, I think that the fairest rating is giving a solid 4-star rating. 
 Certainly due all those deeper details in the original book, I think that novel & movie make an irresistible combo to do. 
 You watched the film, and then you'll appreciate even more the extended information that you'll find in the original novel, but in matters of frightening, well the movie has a clear advantage, but don't dismiss the novel so quickly. 
 Since, may be not the best horror novel that I've ever read,... 
 ...but certainly the book has... 
 ...something to compel you to read it, and have it a huge respect to it. 
 MOVIE V. BOOK: DAWN OF POSSESSION 
 I am not surprised if almost any reader has watched the film before reading the novel.. 
 ...And my case wasn't any different. 
 I have watched the three film versions: Original theatrical, ""The Never-Before-Seen"" version and the ""Extended Director's Cut"". Any comment that I'd make in this review about the film adaptation it will be based on the latest mentioned version, the ""Extended Director's Cut"", due it's the most complete and also it's the one that I have on Blu-ray so it's the one that I have more fresh on my mind. 
 It's interesting how the film is generally accepted as the most terrifying movie of all time, while the novel doesn't keep that distinction. Actually the debate about which novel is the most terrifying of all, it's an endless dispute that I'm sure the general reading community never would be able to agree in a specific novel. 
 While the imagination is the best special effects generator, I have to admit that it wasn't so shocking to read scenes than in the visual presentation where they are truly scary. 
 Even, I don't know if there was the choice of words used in the narrative of the book, since I think that I'd some ""technical"" difficulties to visualize some of those scenes, if I wouldn't have previous notion of how they supposed to look like, thanks to the film. 
 PLAYING DEVIL'S ADVOCATE 
 So, I am still glad of having read the original novel, since not matter the film adaptation covered the most important elements of the general storyline;... 
 ...the novel indeed gives you enlighting info about the background of the characters, even ""new"" characters that didn't appear on the movie version, and deeper development of many of the scenes. 
 On the film, you never have doubt that there is a demon inside of Regan,... 
 ...but in the novel, there are plausible scenarios causing suspicions on other characters, with the chance of a more rational explanation. 
 So, not so ironically, in the same way that you have faith to believe in God, well, the story requires of you to have ""faith"" to believe in the existence of The Devil. 
 That, it's something so curious about many priests in Catholic Church, that I understand that there must be an investigation to discard a simpler explanation to some situations, but it seems that if you say that you're possessed by The Devil or to the contrary, you were witness of the word of God, in any case, the priests will see you as a perfect nut job to send to some psychiatric asylum. 
 So, while the priests are supposed to believe in God, it's like they don't want to believe in the existence of The Devil, that's it's quite odd, since they are both sides of the same religious coin. 
 Also, some elements in the novel, that you may perceive as ""random"" in the film version, even not clarify enough for really understanding why they are in the story, those elements are well developed on the novel and even making ties to the demon inside Regan that you may didn't think about before. 
 Moreover, some reactions and conducts of the characters, knowing key info about their pasts, you can rationalize better why they are reacting in such ways. 
 Even some conversations, they are the same in terms of dialogue, but the mood of them are perceived in a different way in the book, giving some new angles to the dynamics between characters. 
 SPEAKING OF THE DEVIL 
 That's exactly what I expect when I decide to read a book (original novel or novelization) when I already watched the film adaptation. 
 Since while I invest only two hours to watch the movie, I can invest like a week (or more) to read a novel. So, if I read just the exact story on the book, I think that it would kinda pointless, but if I got enough additional info,... 
 ...certainly then, it was well invested time. 
 I think that the most effective element on the construction of the story is that you get a lot of arguments and plausible explanations of what it's going on, so in some reverse psychology gimmick, you get to believe more and more that Regan is indeed possessed by a demon. 
 While in some other novels where they approach the paranormal angle directly, the reader tends to accept it without a doubt. 
 Maybe you don't believe in The Devil or in God even, but don't worry,... 
 ...since you also can say that you don't believe in Jupiter (the planet, not the Roman god) and that doesn't make that that planet isn't out there. 
 Many people are atheists until they have to face a demon by themselves. 
 And it's not like that I am saying that you have to believe in the Christian God, since while I am Catholic, my wish is only that all people believe in some higher power, that you may name whatever you prefer, but believe, in something higher than us. 
 Since some others may call as unrealistic, to believe in gods or higher powers,... 
 ...for me, not believing in some higher power, I'd call it as sad. 
 Believe in God. Beware of The Devil. Both are real, not matter if you believe in them or not. 
 Getting back to the book, I recommend the novel for any fan of the film and wishing to get a deeper developement on the story.

1210,Diary,Chuck Palahniuk,2003,2004,"Misty Wilmot has had it. Once a promising young artist, she's now stuck on an island ruined by tourism, drinking too much and working as a waitress in a hotel. Her husband, a contractor, is in a coma after a suicide attempt, but that doesn't stop his clients from threatening Misty with lawsuits over a series of vile messages they've found on the walls of houses he remodeled.
Suddenly, though, Misty finds her artistic talent returning as she begins a period of compulsive painting. Inspired but confused by this burst of creativity, she soon finds herself a pawn in a larger conspiracy that threatens to cost hundreds of lives. What unfolds is a dark, hilarious story from America's most inventive nihilist, and Palahniuk's most impressive work to date.",Fiction,Intermediate,4,5,14,9.0,11,3.61,59084,4.0,"Liking Chuck Palahniuk's books must be akin to a Fear Factor challenge for most readers. And sometimes I can't help but wonder, what if THAT is what exactly Palahniuk wants the readers to feel about his works? Feel challenged by it, dislike it, feel disgusted or insulted by it--all of these by hurling the naked truths of human nature to the face of people in the harshest possible way? 
 My first Palahniuk book is Choke, and I was sort of culture shocked when I read it--a multitude of f-bombs being dropped from heavenly heights, sexually explicit situations, bitter but truthful ruminations about life. Completely different from the books I've been reading--and that's saying something because I usually go for the ""dark side"" of literature. I thought Choke would already build my literary panoply when it comes to his works. But I was wrong--Diary might not lie on the opposite side of the spectrum when leveled with his other works, but it's a new account of insane despair that I'm not really used to. 
 Diary is a story about art,and, well, the crazy reality that most desperate people live. It also tackles a Marxist concept but viewed from a strangely twisted angle. It is written mostly in the second person point of view and in the format of a 'coma diary' written by the female protagonist, Misty Wilmot. There is no subtlety in Palahniuk's style of writing, and when what he writes stabs, it stabs straight to the heart and conscience. It gets under your skin most of the time. 
 I will not detail everything, but I just want to say that this is a satisfying read. The Palahniuk ""flavor"" is exotic and dark, and it's the sort of taste that most readers will only refer to as ""poison"". If only everyone reads closely, the antidote to the venom of reality that Palahniuk presents in this work is also present--right between the lines.",51.0,1,2862,25729.38,8.99,1006,3,2,3

This chance encounter and its startling consequences propel Katey on a yearlong journey from a Wall Street secretarial pool toward the upper echelons of New York society and the executive suites of Conde Nast--rarefied environs where she will have little to rely upon other than a bracing wit and her own brand of cool nerve.
Wooed in turn by a shy, principled multi-millionaire and an irrepressible Upper East Side ne'er-do-well, befriended by a single-minded widow who is a ahead of her time,and challenged by an imperious mentor, Katey experiences firsthand the poise secured by wealth and station and the failed aspirations that reside just below the surface.

 I really should have put it down after page two, when the female, working-class narrator describes her roommate as follows: 
 ""Eve was one of those surprising beauties from the American Midwest. 
 In New York it becomes so easy to assume that the city's most alluring women have flown in from Paris or Milan. But they're just a minority. A much larger covey hails from the stalwart states that begin with the letter I--like Iowa or Indiana or Illinois. Bred with just the right amount of fresh air, roughhousing, and ignorance, these primative blondes set out from the cornfields looking like starlight with limbs. Every morning in the spring one of them skips off her porch with a sandwich wrapped in cellophane ready to flag down the first Greyhound headed to Manhattan--this city where all things beautiful are welcomed and measured if, if not immediately adopted, then at least tried on for size."" 
 You know, maybe you shouldn't write your debut novel in the first person from the POV of a character of the opposite gender from yourself? Let alone a different time period and socioeconomic (and educational) background? Just a thought?

While I've never read the original novel, I have seen Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now and so made the connection quite quickly. Of course, since Conrad's time the issues have changed and yet in other respects they are perennial. Marina's journey of self-discovery, triggered by its physical counterpart, is also one of those universal themes explored in fiction. 
 'State of Wonder' turned out to be one of those books that I found engaging from its opening pages and could hardly put down. At heart it was an adventure story and there was plenty of excitement as well as an examination of the ethics surrounding medical research and environmental issues. I loved the strength of the story-line, its characters and most of all the Amazon setting. 
 Part of this immediate sense of connection was linked to my work earlier in life with environmental charities where we were advocating the importance of the rainforest along with my continued commitment to the welfare of indigenous peoples, especially in this region. Patchett captures the heat, humidity and the insects of the tropics very effectively. It made me happy that I now live in a part of the world with less exotic flora and fauna. 
 Both this and The Song of Achilles were my favourites among the six short-listed titles for the 2012 Orange Prize. I did favour this one in the final vote due to the issues it explored. It has left me keen to read other novels by Patchett.",10.0,1,605,1210.0,2.0,179,2,3,3

And on a cold November day, four children slip into the forest and witness a killing--an event that will braid their lives together by ambition, love, greed, and revenge....",Fiction,Intermediate,26,1,16,7.115384615384615,4,4.24,194,4.0,"** 4 - 4 1/2 stars ** Having seen the miniseries based on this book before reading the novel, I was interested to delve into the written version. What surprised me most was how different the television adaptation was from Follett's written tale. In fact, for most of this thousand plus page book, I felt I was reading about a story that was not just dissimilar, but in many ways, not remotely like the miniseries. Follett must have had extreme faith in the screenwriters to allow such a diversion from his novel. But, despite all this, both the visual and written telling of Follett's WORLD WITHOUT END are compelling versions of a medieval world. 
 I've read reviews of this novel that stated WORLD WITHOUT END is in many ways a replication of Follett's PILLARS OF THE EARTH. Not having read that novel, I cannot comment, but it does make me hesitate to delve into PILLARS after having already read the lengthy WORLD WITHOUT END. In this telling of the people of fictitious Kingsbridge, England, we're faced with both the good and the evil of the townspeople as they are pitted against one another. If the drama of these circumstances alone is not sufficient to sustain the reader's attention, Follett adequately does the job through the use of the natural backdrop of the Plague. The book was written of a time in England's history where the Catholic faith and superstition ruled that nation. Richard III was king, fighting France, setting off the first 100 years war. 
 Caris Wooler and Merthin Fitzgerald are the protagonists, and while their love story is the focal point of much of the book, I couldn't help feeling that Follett dragged out the inevitable through his use of non-ending obstacles. Once I had gotten to the end of the novel, I felt disappointed on how Follett chose to get there. I felt the book would have been better served had he ended his book sooner, eliminating several obstacles that I found unnecessary toward the end of the novel. I don't think these ongoing obstacles leant to the overall telling of the story, but only served to frustrate me. Caris's & Merthin's adversaries were driven by their endless fanatical obsession with their religion, insatiable greed, or simply evil itself to thwart Caris's and Merthin's dreams. If one is looking for a cleaner, simpler version of Caris's & Merthin's story, the miniseries provides what Follett chose not to do in the book. 
 I would have given this novel five stars had the book ended sooner or didn't appear to be a bit of a letdown after so long of a build-up. I didn't agree with all of Follett's choices, but then again, do we always agree with the choices authors make? Overall, the book was a great read. I was hooked from the onset and read it in less than a week. 
 This book is for the reader who enjoys romance written against the backdrop of worthy history. England's history is notoriously rich, allowing any willing author to delve into the past to pull out a story willing to be told. With WORLD WITHOUT END, Follett proves this truth by creating worthy characters living through a compelling part of history.",2.0,1,915,905.85,0.99,117,2,4,3

 Crichton-mode actived! 
 ;) 
 So, my next novel had to be by Michael Crichton! 
 I went to the bookstore and this one was the first book that I checked and after reading the premise, I found it promising. ;) 
 So, I bought it and started to read it. 
 WoW!!!!!!! 
 Since the beginning I was in shock amalgamated with happiness since the style and mood of the novel was astonishing good. (Of course, by then I hadn't read yet The Andromeda Strain, so the idea of gathering a group of expert scientist to deal with something alien was something new for me :P ) 
 I don't know if happens to you, that sometimes if you are reading a novel that it hasn't being made into a film yet (I read the novel like 5 years before to be poorly adapted to a movie) sometimes I imagined some actor or actress to ""play"" the role of the character in my mind, an amusing thing was by then, in 1993, Sharon Stone was in hype due films like ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Sliver"", so when I imagined some actress to fill my image of Dr. Beth Halperin, I thought in Sharon Stone that she eventually got the role! 
 Honest to God! True story! 
 Curiously, 5 years later, Sharon Stone wasn't in hype anymore so, knowing that she was casted in the role that I pictured in my mind was amusing but odd at the same time. 
 I didn't picture Dustin Hoffman for the role of Dr. Goodman, no offense to Mr. Hoffman, which is an actor that I admired a lot, but I thought in Sean Connery for that character. 
 Anyway, the film was a big dissapointment for me since it was very poor adaptation to such excellent book, so if you ever watched the film and you didn't like it, don't worry, that's normal, 
 but please 
 , if that's the reason that you haven't read this novel yet, 
 please go and read it! 
 (Of course, if you have the luck of not having watched the film, please, PLEASE, don't watch it!) 
 I can assure you that the novel is way, way, 
 WAY 
 , better in infinite ways than that mediocre film. 
 I already mentioned the style and mood of the book, I just want to take the topic again to mention that it was a thrilling experience, since you feel that the story is taken very seriously from the scientific angle. 
 All the journey and process of exploring the alien ship is brilliant, you feel that you are there, down in the bottom in the ocean with them, walking with them. 
 There is a major spoiler in this book, that I won't comment here, don't worry, but please avoid at all costs to know that spoiler if you choose to read the book, since it's that kind of spoilers that if you already knew it before of reading the book, simply you will ruin all the fun of actually reading the book and making the investigation along with the scientist group. 
 If you like sci-fi book and/or techno-thriller novels, this is a 
 GREAT 
 option.

1215,Revival,Stephen King,2014,2014,"In a small New England town, in the early 60s, a shadow falls over a small boy playing with his toy soldiers. Jamie Morton looks up to see a striking man, the new minister. Charles Jacobs, along with his beautiful wife, will transform the local church. The men and boys are all a bit in love with Mrs Jacobs; the women and girls - including Jamie's mother and beloved sister - feel the same about Reverend Jacobs. With Jamie, the Reverend shares a deeper bond, based on their fascination with simple experiments in electricity.
Then tragedy strikes the Jacobs family; the preacher curses God, mocking all religious belief, and is banished from the shocked town.
Jamie has demons of his own. In his mid-thirties, he is living a nomadic lifestyle of bar-band rock and roll. Addicted to heroin, stranded, desperate, he sees Jacobs again - a showman on stage, creating dazzling 'portraits in lightning' - and their meeting has profound consequences for both men. Their bond becomes a pact beyond even the Devil's devising, and Jamie discovers that revivalhas many meanings. Because for every cure there is a price...
This rich and disturbing novel spans five decades on its way to the most terrifying conclusion Stephen King has ever written. It's a masterpiece from King, in the great American tradition of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe.",Fiction,Intermediate,10,1,14,5.0,10,3.75,2384,3.0,"When Jamie Morton first encounters the Reverend Charles Daniel Jacobs, he is six years old. Jacobs cures his brother's muteness, only to leave town a broken man when his wife and son are killed. Jamie and the Rev will cross paths again and again as the Rev seeks to master what he calls the secret electricity, the energy that powers the universe... 
 I found this book to be an extremely mixed bag, which you'll read in a moment. 
 Revival follows the life of Jamie Morton, a rhythm guitarist, whose life intersects with Charles Jacobs, a priest/huckster/mad scientist who things electricity is the key to most of life's mysteries. I'm going to keep this as spoiler-free as possible. 
 Since Stephen King produces best sellers more often than I wash my car, I tend to forget what a great writer he is. I think if he didn't love scaring the piss out of people, he probably would have been a literary writer of some renown. The characters he creates in this seem very real, with an exception I'll cover in a minute. The picture he paints of Jamie Morton's life is very well written, warts and all. 
 While I enjoyed reading the book due to the Kingliness of the writing, it wasn't all that exciting. I was interested in Jamie's journey from rock and roller to drug addict to studio musician but the meat of the story was whenever he crossed paths with Charles Jacobs, or whatever he was calling himself at the time. Structurally, it reminded me of The Shining. There was a long buildup with just enough teasing to keep me interested. If it wasn't for the ending, I probably would have given this a two. 
 The other thing that didn't quite sit right is that Jacobs evolved from being one cartoonish stereotype to another, from devout priest to carny to evangelist to scene-chewing villain. He's the one character I never really believed in. Also, what's with Stephen King's recent obsession with carnies? Doctor Sleep and Joyland both featured them and now this one. 
 All that being said, I was entertained by Revival but not enthralled by it. I LOVED the glimpse of the afterlife at the end. ""That is not dead which can eternal lie"" indeed. Also, the King Easter eggs were also cool. 
 I didn't love it but it's definitely better than Joyland, Doctor Sleep, and Mr. Mercedes. We'll call it 3.5 out of 5.",143.0,1,2916,14550.84,4.99,953,3,4,4

 Tak 
 As a constant King reader, I was looking forward to diving into his twisted mindset again, for believe it or not this was my first King book this year and immediately from page one it felt like home. The whole setting for this book lends itself well to the extreme creepy factor from the ghost town in the middle of a desert to the long stretches of highway that just give this unsettling feeling like something bad is about happen. 
 ""You said 'God is cruel' the way a person who's lived his whole life on Tahiti might say 'Snow is cold'. You

 The plot revolves around this isolated town called Desperation which is located in Nevada, it seems deserted and the only inhabitant is the sheriff who patrols Highway 50 where a bunch of outsiders will, unfortunately, cross paths with the devil himself. Somehow, they get pulled over for some sort of technicality with the law and are brought to Desperation and all hell breaks loose. 
 My experience reading this polarizing, before starting this I read that the book was too heavy on the religiousness or ""preachy"" and I was still not put off by that because The Stand also drew some inspiration from the Bible and used that to explore the Good vs Evil trope it was done smartly and the characters didn't feel like biblical prophets but when it came to this book it felt like I was literally being talked down at. The plot was steady and the suspense was incredible as one would expect with a King but the second half the religious ideologies overtook the storyline. 
 ""In these silences, something may rise"" 
 The characters had a similar effect with the plot, at the beginning each individual had such a strong presence but they slowly dwindled... The whole idea of free will in regards to religion was touched on but once the characters started losing their own personal belief and started making really dumb decisions my enjoyment level started plummeting. 
 Apart from all that the book is really fast paced, devouring the 700pages in a weeks time and the gore factor was top notch. Exploring addiction and alcoholism was well done as the subject hits close to home for Stephen King. I would definitely still recommend it for the sharp writing and atmosphere but it isn't like my favorite King book, I have read better. Still, you sound check it out if the premise sounds interesting or if you are King addict. 
 I would definitely check out The Regulators to see how the narratives pair together.

 ********** 
 A seemingly unending stream of word vomit. 
 I can think of no other way to describe this thing. 
 I really, really despised almost everything about The Corrections. I finished it solely so that I could write a horrible review and have it be valid. 
 At no single point before the last 10 pages of this 566-page monster did I feel a shred of sympathy with any of the characters. There were several moments where I thought Franzen would have been better off writing dialogue-for-the-average-Joe instead of the trumped up and out of place Dawson's Creek-esque vocabulary in almost every human interaction. His insistence on using the ""25-cent word"" at every turn made reading the story choppy at best... aggravating and unenjoyable. 
 I also couldn't help but see the author in a lot of his characters' worst personality traits. Annoying hipster-lecher I'm-better-than-capitalism-but-still-depend-on-it Chip. Whiny too-good-for-anyone Gary. Ungrateful I'm-a-bitch-but-require-all-your-love-and-attention Denise. The parents? Alfred is the only one for whom I felt any sympathy and that didn't happen until the last dregs of the book... and I think maybe even then it was a knee-jerk reaction at being so close to the book being over. Enid's issues rubbed me the wrong way for many reasons, not the least of which being that I could see my own mother in her... which means, I suppose, that Enid was probably the most well-represented character in the novel. 
 The secondary characters were almost entirely a sorry lot with personalities to the extreme in any number of directions - too smart, too stupid, too needy, too plain, too EVERYTHING. 
 I know that I'll never understand the praise this book received from critics and readers... and I'm ok with that. I do wish, however, that I could meet some of the people who relate it so easily to real life. Meeting them, perhaps, would truly terrify me.",278.0,1,825,816.75,0.99,135,1,4,2

1220,Beautiful Ruins,Jess Walter,2012,2012,"The story begins in 1962. On a rocky patch of the sun-drenched Italian coastline, a young innkeeper, chest-deep in daydreams, looks out over the incandescent waters of the Ligurian Sea and spies an apparition: a tall, thin woman, a vision in white, approaching him on a boat. She is an actress, he soon learns, an American starlet, and she is dying.
And the story begins again today, half a world away, when an elderly Italian man shows up on a movie studio's back lot--searching for the mysterious woman he last saw at his hotel decades earlier.
What unfolds is a dazzling, yet deeply human, roller coaster of a novel, spanning fifty years and nearly as many lives. From the lavish set of Cleopatrato the shabby revelry of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Walter introduces us to the tangled lives of a dozen unforgettable characters: the starstruck Italian innkeeper and his long-lost love; the heroically preserved producer who once brought them together and his idealistic young assistant; the army veteran turned fledgling novelist and the rakish Richard Burton himself, whose appetites set the whole story in motion--along with the husbands and wives, lovers and dreamers, superstars and losers, who populate their world in the decades that follow.

1221,The White Tower,James Ramsey Ullman,1945,2006,"""In years to come the world will look to The White Toweras the moment when Australian crime fiction got up off its hind legs and howled: We Are Here.""
---Ken Bruen, author of The Dramatist
""'Jumpers,' McCallum was saying. 'Jumpers are---well, in my experience jumpers are always badly disturbed. They choose to jump because it's so violent.'""
The body of Niall Howley, a young man with golden hair, is found at the base of the Telstra Tower---the famed communications tower atop Canberra's Black Mountain. Local authorities are content to accept Niall's death as a straightforward suicide. But his apparent ""suicide note"" leaves many unanswered questions.
The note is an image on Niall's computer screen---a digitalized image of himself sprawled at the bottom of cliff . . . an exact replica of the positioning of his body as it was found near the Telstra Tower. Desperate for answers, and fearing murder, his mother seeks out the help of Sandra Mahoney, a computer crime consultant.
Niall had been---until recently---an integral member in a role-playing internet game---and his suicide turns out to be bizarre echo of his own character's death. Niall's death, and its connection to the fate of his internet character force Mahoney to reexamine every angle.
While juggling her own baby daughter, a Russian lover, a needy dog, and a plaguing ex-husband, Sandra races across the globe in pursuit of truth on behalf of a mother who wants to know how a game killed her son. And finds that the threads of truth and illusion can easily wind into a game of manipulation and deceit.
Australian author Dorothy Johnston returns with the second book featuring Inspector Sandra Mahoney; in a thrilling and intelligent mystery that searches for one mother's truth.
International Praise for The WhiteTower
""This is an artfully seductive crime story.""
---The Age (Australia)

The white tower with its viewing platforms looks like a giant hypodermic needle on top of the Black Mountain. The police assumed that the victim was suicidal. Niall was addicted to a role-playing Internet game, and his death resembled the death of his character in the Castle of the Heroes game. But as Sandra investigates Niall's life, she discovers he was also having troubles at work where he was a radiotherapist. Controlling parents, and a breakup with his girlfriend were additional problems. Was Niall's death a suicide or a murder? 
 Sandra works to solve the mystery with her detective efforts on two fronts--interviewing his coworkers at the hospital, and trying to unravel the relationships in the cyberworld. The role-playing gamers can hide their identities online, and often use their acting skills when Sandra is interviewing them in person. 
 Sandra, the mother of two young children, lives with her partner Ivan, a skillful hacker. She seems very real, and is very different from the alcoholic loners that populate much crime fiction.

Sisters. Strangers. Survivors.
More than twenty years ago, Claire and Lydia's teenaged sister Julia vanished without a trace. The two women have not spoken since, and now their lives could not be more different. Claire is the glamorous trophy wife of an Atlanta millionaire. Lydia, a single mother, dates an ex-con and struggles to make ends meet. But neither has recovered from the horror and heartbreak of their shared loss--a devastating wound that's cruelly ripped open when Claire's husband is killed.
The disappearance of a teenage girl and the murder of a middle-aged man, almost a quarter-century apart: what could connect them? Forming a wary truce, the surviving sisters look to the past to find the truth, unearthing the secrets that destroyed their family all those years ago . . . and uncovering the possibility of redemption, and revenge, where they least expect it.

This has climbed to the top of my list as my favorite psychological thriller ever. This tops Dark Places and That Night and I never thought that would happen! For any book to triumph over those is a win for me :) although they are still right behind this book. 
 I've never read a book like this. There are so many twists and turns a race car driver would have trouble navigating. I literally cannot stop thinking about all of the people and events in this book. I went into it with just the knowledge that this was about a woman and her sister that hadn't spoken for years and that was about it. Holy moly did this get good! 
 I simply cannot say enough good things about Pretty Girls. The plot is terrifying yet makes you want to read on because you have to know what happens. Literally every chapter gives you a new twist. The characters are so real I could picture them inside of my mind as I read and the scenery... I could see it all.

Now, years later, Vix is working in New York City. Caitlin is getting married on the Vineyard. And the early magic of their long, complicated friendship has faded. But Caitlin has begged Vix to come to her wedding, to be her maid of honor. And Vix knows that she will go--for the friend whose casual betrayals she remembers all too well.

I never could have expected a story so involving and complex. The characters come to life on the pages, and the storyline is brilliant in its everyday commonness. 
 Summer Sisters follows the lives of Caitlyn Somers and Victoria Leonard, two unlikely girls from different social backgrounds. Caitlin invites Victoria to stay the summer with her and her father who lives in Martha's Vineyard; shy Victoria can't imagine why a girl so glamorous as Caitlin would want to be friend someone as boring as herself. The two of them form a complex friendship of love and rivalry that spans from the 1970s to the 1990s. 
 These girls share moments of soaring loyalty and heartbreaking betrayal, and I was glued from the very first page. The settings are so real, part of them I could have plucked from my own childhood. This is a truly wonderful book for anyone who loves reading epics, or stories of friendship that takes place in times of joy and times of tragedy. 
 Although this book came out in 2001 (I believe), I am just now reading it. Oh, how I wish I'd found it sooner! Summer Sisters is one of the best of the best from my reading pool of 2007. I highly recommend this book.

AUTHOR'S FOREWORD
You might not want to buy this book.
I know, that's not the sort of thing an author is supposed to say. The marketing people aren't going to like this. My editor is going to have a fit. But I'd rather be honest with you right out of the gate.
First, if you haven't read my other books, you don't want to start here.
My first two books are The Name of the Windand The Wise Man's Fear. If you're curious to try my writing, start there. They're the best introduction to my world. This book deals with Auri, one of the characters from that series. Without the context of those books, you're probably going to feel pretty lost.
Second, even if you have read my other books, I think it's only fair to warn you that this is a bit of a strange story. I don't go in for spoilers, but suffice to say that this one is ... different. It doesn't do a lot of the things a classic story is supposed to do. And if you're looking for a continuation of Kvothe's storyline, you're not going to find it here.
On the other hand, if you'd like to learn more about Auri, this story has a lot to offer. If you love words and mysteries and secrets. If you're curious about the Underthing and alchemy. If you want to know more about the hidden turnings of my world...
Well, then this book might be for you.",Fiction,Intermediate,4,2,14,7.75,11,3.91,107,5.0,"This is a story for people like me. 
 Names are important. The act of naming is deep magic, old magic. Of 3s, of 7s, of 9s. Of unnamed stairs, unknown places, of a nameless world named, this story is beyond beauty, it is right, balanced true. 
 Reading this before the official release, is a treat. It is also a privilege. One I am not entirely certain I deserve. 
 By now, you know that this is not book 3 in Pat's wondrous Kingkiller Chronicle. I think it's better than book 3. Better because it's here, ready to be read, to be loved, to be held, to be reread. Book 3 isn't ready yet, and that's okay. Book 3 will arrive in its own time, not before. And when book 3 is ready, it will be... it will be beautiful, and sad, and polished smooth as a round river stone tucked secret by water, time, and patients. But for now, The Slow Regard of Silent Things is to be savored. Best served slow with deliberate attention to appreciation, a nibbling, a pause, a tasting. Don't bolt back this narrative. Rather, relish the layering, the quiet craft, the breathless wonder of secret places, of dark places. 
 This is a sliver of Auri's story, her tending of the world. I can not imagine a better glimpse into the Underthing. I didn't want it to end. 
 I was mesmerized. Call it what you like, spellbound, tongue-tied, lost to the deep-dive rapture of never wishing to surface, I shucked the here, and found myself there. As a reader, Auri is dear to me. I can only hope that what is to come will not press a lasting grief or harm upon her. 
 Keep her safe, Pat. Please keep her safe. 
 We all know Pat is a skilled writer. His proficiency with language and syntactical meter are deceptively pleasing, and when combined with a shrewd attention to detail, you can't help but recognize the art within the craft. This story is unique, in content and presentation. And such dialogue would be better had round a fire, with a dram as winter hunkers down, than in an asynchronous online book review. Yes, this story is a little different. But all you need to know is that it's good. 
 Now, let's talk audiobook. 
 Pat Rothfuss steps out from behind his clackity-clunkity keyboard and permits us to bask in his narrator debut. Rothfuss is a solid reader. Yeah, he's got a pleasing set of pipes. Yeah, he's a great writer. But the guy narrates like a natural. I know I know I know. Reading out loud? What's the big deal? First of all, it is a big deal. And nextly, it's far more difficult than most might imagine. Many professional narrators overact the text, or slip into an ear-bleeding map reading cadence, rendering a jagged, and regretful, audio experience. Rothfuss delivers a reading ripe with feeling and authenticity. I hope, far in the future when Pat has an abundance of time, he will go back and read all of The Kingkiller Chronicles. Not too many authors find success in reading their own work. Neil Gaiman can, but then again, Gaiman could read pharmaceutical warning labels and I'd clap like a drunken seal, barking for more more more! Point being, Rothfuss does a damn fine job reading his first audiobook. 
 Here's my advice: 
 Grab the audiobook. Experience this story as spoiler-free as possible. Keep an ear/eye out for hidden gems within the text, they are there, but I ain't tellin where.",15.0,1,4240,16917.600000000002,3.99,1156,4,4,2

Londoners Jack and Syd moved into the house a year ago. It seemed like their dream home: tons of space, the perfect location, and a friendly owner who wanted a young couple to have it.
So when they made a grisly discovery in the attic, Jack and Syd chose to ignore it. That was a mistake.
Because someone has just been murdered. Right outside their back door.
And now the police are watching them...",Fiction,Intermediate,7,1,15,5.857142857142857,14,3.57,332,5.0,"This is a wonderfully dark and twisted psychological thriller by Simon Lelic. It shifts and runs into unexpected places, different from the blurb given about the book. Jack has uncomfortable feelings about a London house that his girlfriend, Syd Baker, thinks is perfect for them. To their surprise, given they tendered a lower offer, the owner chooses them. When something is too good to be true, they should have been more wary, but they move in without a second thought. The previous owner has left behind all his belongings, which the happy couple begin to sort through. However, there are strange sounds, and gruesome discoveries in the attic. There is a child's treasure box with a familiar name on it. The story begins with the police watching the house, with Jack and Syd writing down their experiences of living there, with the occasional contentious perception. This is a novel about the past haunting the present with its firm and tenacious grip. 
 The narrative is delivered through our couple, Jack and Syd, documenting how their lives begin to spiral out of their control. Jack is a housing officer who goes out of his way to help his desperate clients. He is not close with his middle class parents who disapprove of Syd. Syd's past contains trauma and drug taking, making her a more volatile character, but she is committed to Jack, hoping for a more settled future with him. Syd's mother visits and recognises a picture on their wall. Syd finds herself becoming close to Elsie Payne, a young girl that lives locally. We learn of the details of the historical past of Syd and Jack, and how it connects to their dire present situation. This is a story that covers the issues of dysfunctional families, fathers, trust, loss and the search for justice, by whatever means possible. 
 Lelic has a gripping writing style that just grabs the reader right from the beginning. His plotting is remarkably well handled, and the narrative is so compelling, tense and suspenseful, driven by the well executed twists. I find psychological thrillers a hit or miss affair, this is a hit in every sense, I can see this being a bestseller, and deservedly so. What is really outstanding is the characters of Jack and Syd, they are superbly developed, particularly Syd. A morally ambiguous and brilliant read that I highly recommend!

1228,Needful Things,Stephen King,1991,1992,"Leland Gaunt opens a new shop in Castle Rock called Needful Things. Anyone who enters his store finds the object of his or her lifelong dreams and desires: a prized baseball card, a healing amulet. In addition to a token payment, Gaunt requests that each person perform a little ""deed,"" usually a seemingly innocent prank played on someone else from town. These practical jokes cascade out of control and soon the entire town is doing battle with itself. Only Sheriff Alan Pangborn suspects that Gaunt is behind the population's increasingly violent behavior.",Fiction,Intermediate,20,2,14,4.2,5,3.88,155887,5.0,"Mr. King likes to tell stories about people getting trapped. He's got one about a guy trapped in a bedroom. He's got a whole bunch of these stories, really. He's got people trapped inside a car, in a gas station, a classroom, a grocery store, a hotel, on an island, a city under a giant force field. I'm pretty sure he's got one about a lady handcuffed to a bed for the whole book. I'm just going from memory here. He's probably got a lot more. 
 In Needful Things, the entire town of Castle Rock is trapped by their possessions. Its citizens are punished mercilessly for 700+ pages with some special brand of evil that feeds off the sin of imbuing bric-a-brac with sentimental value. 
 Admittedly, I'm oversimplifying the plot of this book quite a bit. But Needful Things is just a morality tale at its core, a boldfaced warning about materialism. The message of the book seems to boil down to something we all heard as kids, mom saying that you don't need those roller skates, you just want them. 
 But to say that this is only a simple morality tale really does this book a disservice. It's got all the things I like in a King book: suspense, action, gore, folksy humor (the cruel and the crude varieties), characters you can identify with, protagonists you care about, insane people and perverts, monsters and great big explosions. Most importantly, it's got a great villain. Our bad guy, Leland Gaunt, isn't subtle, he chews up the scenery at every turn, but he's exactly what this novel calls for. Done well (and King does them very well), comic book villains are the best kind. All right, maybe just the most fun to read about. 
 And, yes, this book had some of the Stephen King things I don't like so much. I feel sometimes King is writing down to his characters, like he'll create a character just for the sake of mockery. Lester Pratt, the goody two-shoes, Christian 'boy scout' character in this book is a prime example. I would be willing to bet that no one ever--no matter how repressed and/or brainwashed, sheltered, or close-minded--ever, ever had an internal monologue that's featured the celebratory phrase ""rooty toot toot"" repeatedly while thinking about the prospect of getting some pussy. 
 King also has a tendency to veer into some rather cloying, almost treacly, Garrison Keillor territory, and in this book the opening and closing are perhaps the most nauseating examples of this that I've personally encountered. 
 And then, like with many of King's novels, we have the borderline deus ex machina ending. 
 Now, I know what you're thinking: 
 Wow, it seemed like there for a minute you were saying you like Stephen King. But now it seems like you're being rather hard on the guy. 
 But, you see, the thing is, Stephen King is sort of like the President of the United States of America. (Bear with me here.) The people you hear bitching about the President the most, the people who are the hardest on him, seem to always be the very same people who voted him into office. I've read over thirty books by Stephen King. So, in my mind, that pretty much means I voted that son-of-a-bitch into office over thirty fucking times! 
 I'll say what I want. 
 And now you're probably asking, would you vote for that son-of-a-bitch again?

1229,Life After Life,Kate Atkinson,2013,2013,"What if you had the chance to live your life again and again, until you finally got it right?
~from the back cover",Fiction,Intermediate,8,3,14,7.625,5,3.74,537,2.0,"What if you had the chance to live your life again and again, until you finally got it right? 
 Ursula Todd is born in a snowstorm in England in 1910 but dies before she can take her first breath. During that same snowstorm she was born again and lives to tell the tale; again and again. Life after Life tells the story of Ursula's lives, as with each new life she makes small changes that send her on a completely different path. 
 I feel like I'm the only person on the planet that thought this book was overhyped and over rated. Sure Kate Atkinson has this trippy ability to create this bleak world while still managing to add some wit and compassion but it wasn't the writing that was at fault. The premise of the book makes it sound really good but let's face it; it is just Groundhog Day in disguise. The book is clever, but it tries too hard to be clever and it didn't really turn out the way it should have; for me anyway. This book is getting so many rave reviews, I feel like I am a black sheep just telling people it did not work. 
 As I said before, there is nothing wrong with the writing; Kate Atkinson has created this lyrical narrative and I did find myself being swept away in the words. I even felt like at times I was reading this book without thinking about what was happening; a few times I had to stop and process before continuing. I almost found myself not noticing a death and Ursula's life starting again and that could have got me completely lost. I did feel like Kate Atkinson did however overdo the twists and it turned out to be a roundabout way to retell the same story over and over again with different outcomes. This could have worked; and it sounds like it worked for many people but I sadly wasn't one of them. 
 I wonder if Kate Atkinson was trying something different and experimental where she could play with the character's death and life, explore the concept of life's choices and their consequences but because there were no real penalty to Ursula's life I wonder if it really worked? Do you ever have deja vu? (I don't think so, but I could check with the kitchen) Life after Life just seems to repeat the same scenes, some readers might gain a sense of familiarity and for me it just felt like I wasn't getting anywhere. 
 Life after Life is the kind of book you should probably read in a real cold climate; the snowy, dark and sometimes bleakness of the novel seems to call for it. Maybe read snuggled up on a dark winters night and don't forget your booties 'cause it's cooooold out there today (It's coooold out there every day. What is this, Miami Beach?). It is just the book that would work better in the cold; though it is never cold here in Townsville, maybe that's why it didn't work for me. 
 I really wanted to enjoy this book; I will try another Kate Atkinson novel because I really think she has a great style. Just so happened Life after Life was not for me and I know people loved this book and will probably complain about this review but at least it was just an excuse to put some Groundhog Day quotes into something. This book has had so many positive reviews so maybe it is just me, if the book sounds like something you'd like then don't let this review stop you, is it too early for flapjacks?

1230,Nights In Rodanthe,Nicholas Sparks,2002,2006,"Kisah yang menyentuh hati, tentang harapan, suka cita, dan, memaafkan, dan bahwa cinta bisa datang setiap saat, tak mengenal waktu dan usia, sering kali justru pada saat tidak diharapkan.
Pada usia 45 tahun, Adrienne Willis mesti menata kembali hidupnya setelah suaminya meninggalkannya untuk wanita yang lebih muda. Masih dengan kesedihan mendalam, ia menerima tawaran seorang teman untuk menjaga penginapan di Rodanthe, kota pantai kecil di Carolina Utara.
Ketika badai besar mengarah ke kota itu, tampaknya Adrienne akan terisolasi di sana, namun ternyata ada seorang tamu yang datang. Paul Flanner. Paul, dokter berusia 54 tahun, telah menjual prakteknya dan datang ke Rodanthe untuk berdamai dengan dirinya dan masa lalunya. Dua orang yang sama-sama ""terluka"" ini menemukan penghiburan satu sama lain, dan kebersamaan pada satu akhir minggu itu mengubah banyak hal dalam hidup mereka.",Fiction,Intermediate,11,1,15,7.454545454545454,11,3.82,55,5.0,"Sekali lagi saya terpesona oleh gaya penceritaan Nicholas Sparks. Mendayu-dayu tapi tidak menye-menye. Romantis namun tidak bombastis. Ceritanya mudah ditebak, walaupun begitu tetap saja saya dibawa ikut dalam irama drama yang naik turun. 
 Hebatnya lagi begitu jelas dan detilnya Nic Sparks menceritakan bagaimana kisah cinta dua manusia di usia yang tak lagi muda, namun tetap sangat menarik. Saya ikut merasakan getar dan gelora asmara yang dialami kedua tokoh utama Nights in Rodanthe. Plus saat mengetahui endingnya, saya tak tahan untuk tidak mengeluarkan air mata. 
 Dibilang happy ending nggak. Dibilang sad ending pun tidak. Yang jelas kemarin saya sangat merasakan ketulusan sebuah cinta sejati, tak lekang oleh waktu. Mau tak mau saya teringat kisah mama dan papa saya sendiri. Mereka bertemu di saat usia papa yang tidak muda lagi, 37 tahun. Tahun 1979 mereka menikah dan tahun 1990 mama saya meninggal. Cukup singkat kebersamaan mereka, tapi sampai saat ini, detik ini, kapanpun papa menceritakan soal mama, beliau menceritakan mama dengan pancaran cinta yang tak pernah berubah. Terkadangpun saat kami duduk bareng, papa masih berbicara seakan-akan mama saya masih ada, ""Min, anakmu sudah besar sekarang. Mia sudah bisa cari uang sendiri lho, lihat saja bukunya semakin numpuk tiap hari"" 
 *kenapa jadi nyesek ya :p* 
 Yah seperti itulah. Dan perasaan 'nyesek' itu yang saya rasa saat membaca buku ini. Sesak sedih, sesak bahagia juga. Mengetahui bahwa orang yang dicinta sudah tenang di alam sana namun cinta dan semangat itu akan tetap ada.

 Who can say for certain 
 Maybe you're still here 
 I feel you all around me 
 Your memories so clear 
 Deep in the stillness 
 I can hear you speak 
 You're still an inspiration 
 Can it be 
 That you are mine 
 Forever love 
 And you are watching over me from up above 
 Fly me up to where you are 
 Beyond the distant star 
 I wish upon tonight 
 To see you smile 
 If only for awhile to know you're there 
 A breath away's not far 
 To where you are 
 Are you gently sleeping 
 Here inside my dream 
 And isn't faith believing 
 All power can't be seen 
 As my heart holds you 
 Just one beat away 
 I cherish all you gave me everyday 
 'cause you are mine 
 Forever love 
 Watching me from up above 
 And I believe 
 That angels breathe 
 And that love will live on and never leave",13.0,1,1123,5603.77,4.99,92,2,4,2

The stories are told by people who have all answered an ad headlined 'Artists Retreat: Abandon your life for three months'. They are led to believe that here they will leave behind all the distractions of 'real life' that are keeping them from creating the masterpiece that is in them.
But 'here' turns out to be a cavernous and ornate old theater where they are utterly isolated from the outside world - and where heat and power and, most importantly, food are in increasingly short supply.

1232,Freedom,William Safire,1987,2010,"In his first novel since The Corrections, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Walter and Patty Berglund as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.
(from the back cover)",Fiction,Intermediate,10,6,15,8.517241379310345,3,3.73,3971,2.0,"UPDATED. 
 To keep in style of the book this review will be just a lot of rambling. 
 I mean, it was mostly a soap opera. And I just don't do soap operas. I can just about manage about 10 minutes every 5th episode, but that's about it. And Franzen submitted me to 570 bloody pages of a soap opera which I had to digest in a few sittings. 
 Like in all soap operas, everything ends well and love conquers all, of course some characters might have to be killed off along the way, but it seems like a small price to pay for a happy ending, non? 
 If it was well written, then maybe. But how can I take this sort of thing seriously: 
 ""Patty said no, Walter insisted, she insisted no, he insisted yes. Then she realized he didn't have a car and was offering to ride the bus with her, and she insisted no all over again, and he insisted yes"" 
 Sorry, what is this? Is this the Great American Novel? Are you kidding me? 
 ""She almost suggested to Walter that he had better kiss her first, if he was going to be asking her to live with him, but she was so offended that she didn't feel like being kissed at that moment."" 
 And if you are tired of this sugary girly revelations, you can get the more raw stuff when the perspective changes to Katz: 
 ""His dick was saying yes to something now, and this something was certainly not the wideish ass of the retreating jogger. Had death, in fact, been his dick's message in sending him to Washington? Had he simply misunderstood its prophecy?"" 
 You get the idea. 
 And don't even get me started on the fucked up chronology. It wasn't done in eloquent, mysterious way, it was done in a blabbermouth with ADHD way. It is like my friend Maciek, who tells me a story and in the middle of it he remembers some other story that might or might not be related to the story he is telling me so he tells me that other story, and then some other story that somehow came from the second story, and then maybe he will return to the main story and you end up wondering if the second story actually happened in the middle of the first story or it was just his way of telling a story. 
 The final moral from this book is that we are all fucked up in our own special way but it will all be alright unless, of course, we become Republicans, in which case there will be no redemption. 
 It almost killed me. This book almost killed me. But as they say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, therefore this book made stronger, so for that alone I had to give it two stars. 
 I will admit that Patty and Walter were both interesting characters with all the supporting cast being all sorts of caricatures and serving as props to the main duo. 
 Now, I am off to read a book about people who do things and have real problems. 
 *UPDATE - oh yeah. And I also forgot to say that if this book was written by a woman, it would be deemed chick lit and stuck in a pastel colour cover with birds and flowers. No one would even look at it twice because there is so much better chick lit out there. But as Jonathan Franzen is lucky enough to be a man, this, all of a sudden, is the Great American Novel. DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH. 
 If anyone else claims there is no sexism in literary/publishing world, this here is my best demonstrative evidence that there is. Honest to God, who would take this book seriously if it was written by a woman and had something pink on the cover?",71.0,1,860,6871.400000000001,7.99,128,2,3,2

And on a cold November day, four children slip into the forest and witness a killing--an event that will braid their lives together by ambition, love, greed, and revenge....",Fiction,Intermediate,26,1,16,7.115384615384615,4,4.24,194,4.0,"** 4 - 4 1/2 stars ** Having seen the miniseries based on this book before reading the novel, I was interested to delve into the written version. What surprised me most was how different the television adaptation was from Follett's written tale. In fact, for most of this thousand plus page book, I felt I was reading about a story that was not just dissimilar, but in many ways, not remotely like the miniseries. Follett must have had extreme faith in the screenwriters to allow such a diversion from his novel. But, despite all this, both the visual and written telling of Follett's WORLD WITHOUT END are compelling versions of a medieval world. 
 I've read reviews of this novel that stated WORLD WITHOUT END is in many ways a replication of Follett's PILLARS OF THE EARTH. Not having read that novel, I cannot comment, but it does make me hesitate to delve into PILLARS after having already read the lengthy WORLD WITHOUT END. In this telling of the people of fictitious Kingsbridge, England, we're faced with both the good and the evil of the townspeople as they are pitted against one another. If the drama of these circumstances alone is not sufficient to sustain the reader's attention, Follett adequately does the job through the use of the natural backdrop of the Plague. The book was written of a time in England's history where the Catholic faith and superstition ruled that nation. Richard III was king, fighting France, setting off the first 100 years war. 
 Caris Wooler and Merthin Fitzgerald are the protagonists, and while their love story is the focal point of much of the book, I couldn't help feeling that Follett dragged out the inevitable through his use of non-ending obstacles. Once I had gotten to the end of the novel, I felt disappointed on how Follett chose to get there. I felt the book would have been better served had he ended his book sooner, eliminating several obstacles that I found unnecessary toward the end of the novel. I don't think these ongoing obstacles leant to the overall telling of the story, but only served to frustrate me. Caris's & Merthin's adversaries were driven by their endless fanatical obsession with their religion, insatiable greed, or simply evil itself to thwart Caris's and Merthin's dreams. If one is looking for a cleaner, simpler version of Caris's & Merthin's story, the miniseries provides what Follett chose not to do in the book. 
 I would have given this novel five stars had the book ended sooner or didn't appear to be a bit of a letdown after so long of a build-up. I didn't agree with all of Follett's choices, but then again, do we always agree with the choices authors make? Overall, the book was a great read. I was hooked from the onset and read it in less than a week. 
 This book is for the reader who enjoys romance written against the backdrop of worthy history. England's history is notoriously rich, allowing any willing author to delve into the past to pull out a story willing to be told. With WORLD WITHOUT END, Follett proves this truth by creating worthy characters living through a compelling part of history.",2.0,1,915,905.85,0.99,117,2,4,3
1237,Beautiful Ruins,Jess Walter,2012,2012,"The story begins in 1962. On a rocky patch of the sun-drenched Italian coastline, a young innkeeper, chest-deep in daydreams, looks out over the incandescent waters of the Ligurian Sea and spies an apparition: a tall, thin woman, a vision in white, approaching him on a boat. She is an actress, he soon learns, an American starlet, and she is dying.
And the story begins again today, half a world away, when an elderly Italian man shows up on a movie studio's back lot--searching for the mysterious woman he last saw at his hotel decades earlier.
What unfolds is a dazzling, yet deeply human, roller coaster of a novel, spanning fifty years and nearly as many lives. From the lavish set of Cleopatrato the shabby revelry of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Walter introduces us to the tangled lives of a dozen unforgettable characters: the starstruck Italian innkeeper and his long-lost love; the heroically preserved producer who once brought them together and his idealistic young assistant; the army veteran turned fledgling novelist and the rakish Richard Burton himself, whose appetites set the whole story in motion--along with the husbands and wives, lovers and dreamers, superstars and losers, who populate their world in the decades that follow.

 I could not wait to finish this book and escape from these people who make life so damned complicated for themselves and others. For me, the constant changing of past and present times was often disjointed. I did not see anything beautiful, only the ruins of a hyperactive plot.

While I've never read the original novel, I have seen Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now and so made the connection quite quickly. Of course, since Conrad's time the issues have changed and yet in other respects they are perennial. Marina's journey of self-discovery, triggered by its physical counterpart, is also one of those universal themes explored in fiction. 
 'State of Wonder' turned out to be one of those books that I found engaging from its opening pages and could hardly put down. At heart it was an adventure story and there was plenty of excitement as well as an examination of the ethics surrounding medical research and environmental issues. I loved the strength of the story-line, its characters and most of all the Amazon setting. 
 Part of this immediate sense of connection was linked to my work earlier in life with environmental charities where we were advocating the importance of the rainforest along with my continued commitment to the welfare of indigenous peoples, especially in this region. Patchett captures the heat, humidity and the insects of the tropics very effectively. It made me happy that I now live in a part of the world with less exotic flora and fauna.

At age twenty-two, Lotto and Mathilde are tall, glamorous, madly in love, and destined for greatness. A decade later, their marriage is still the envy of their friends, but with an electric thrill we understand that things are even more complicated and remarkable than they have seemed.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,7,14,10.77777777777778,3,3.56,68846,2.0,"This book was a HUGE disappointment. I mean, holy purple prose, Batman! I really loved Lauren Groff's writing in Arcadia - it was beautiful and touching, with gorgeous metaphors. But Fates and Furies is pretentious and overwritten. It tries so hard to be a literary masterpiece that you end up with asides like this one: 
 Her mother had smelled of cold and scales, her father of stone dust and dog. She imagined her husband's mother, whom she had never met, had a whiff of rotting apples, although her stationery had stunk of baby powder and rose perfume. Sallie was starch, cedar. Her dead grandmother, sandalwood. Her uncle, Swiss cheese. People told her she smiled like garlic, like chalk, like nothing at all. Lotto, clean as camphor at his neck and belly, like electrified pennies at the armpit, like chlorine at the groin. 
 If you like convoluted metaphors and improbable life stories, you will enjoy this book. If you like reading descriptions of fictional avant-garde plays that add modernist touches to ancient stories (think Antigone transformed into ""Go""), you will enjoy this book. But most importantly, if you like the grotesque, you will enjoy this book. The entire thing is a bizarre parody of what two people's life stories could actually be like, and the fantastical, absurd elements are what really stand out. 
 The narrative constantly asks us: what is given up by each party in a relationship? What is worth giving up for a marriage, and how can two people stay together? There were a few poignant scenes where I really felt like Groff had captured this for Lotto and Mathilde, and I actually felt invested in their relationship: 
 Great swaths of her life were white space to her husband. What she did not tell him balanced neatly with what she did. Still, there are untruths made of words and untruths made of silences, and Mathilde had only ever lied to Lotto in what she never said. 
 But even that fell apart for me given how ridiculous I found most of the book. Serious ""plot"" spoilers behind tags: I probably should have stopped reading this in the first hundred pages, when in the space of a few pages, a fourteen-year-old boy first discovers the suicide of his classmate, and then his drama teacher (who - surprise! - sparks his love of acting) gives him a surprise, consolatory blow job in the high school gym . Or when I realized that Chollie (god) was a character who was actually going to stick around for awhile. Or when I got to Mathilde's half of the book, which is supposed to humanize her and round out the narrative, when really it just had me raising my eyebrows for a solid 200 pages. 
 The implication that married couples have secrets from each other is a sensible one; the idea that Mathilde had her tubes tied and then listened to Lotto talk about children for three decades is not . And something about Mathilde's self-sacrifice really rubbed me the wrong way. Near the end of the book, Mathilde begins to write plays as well, including one called Volumnia. The book blatantly tries to sell us that it's unsuccessful because Mathilde as a woman gave up so much for Lotto's success (Volumnia is always more interesting than Coriolanus, but who would go to see that play?, etc.). But after reaching the end of the book, I vehemently disagree. Lotto is a bumbling sex-focused idiot for most of the book--it's Mathilde who's cleaning up his plays, drawing on her connections to get the plays made, and managing his success. If she had put the same amount of effort or time into her own work, she would have been just as successful. I get that her past is supposed to make her look for something ""good"" and she doesn't believe she deserves the success, but the attempt to talk about her own art as secondary to Lotto's falls flat. That is a choice that she made, and it's not a choice that would have ruined the marriage. Or if it had, so what?

In ""Low Men in Yellow Coats,"" eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood and that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror.
In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest...and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast.
In ""Blind Willie"" and ""Why We're in Vietnam,"" two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow and haunted as their own lives.
And in ""Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling,"" Bobby returns to his hometown where one final secret, and his heart's desire may await him.
Full of danger, suspense, and full of heart, Hearts In Atlantis takes some listeners to a place they have never been...and others to a place they have never been able to completely leave.",Fiction,Intermediate,16,4,15,8.0625,5,3.8,277,5.0,"No one has ever written the joys of boyhood better than Stephen King. That's not what people talk about when they talk about him, but it's true. It's a subject that needs to be written about entirely without pretense and absolutely free of language too large for ball games and playing in the mud. Between this one, The Body, and It, the good reader will find himself transported into the actual moments of young pleasure, before girls take over and ruin the perfect freedom of true youth. Not that girls are bad, of course, just that something breaks at the moment when boys become aware of them and it never comes all the way back. Often, I wonder about how much of a man's life is spent trying to dance between the moment before and the excitement that comes after the discovery of girls. This small gap is the space that King covers in several of his books and all of them are delightful and thrilling in the way that only a carnival can be to a young boy. Moments of the supernatural and plot aside, it's this subject that draws me to the book. 
 For reasons I can't fully explain, I've read the first 200 pages of this one half a dozen times over the years but never finished it. I've purchased the audiobook twice (by accident) and bought the paperback two or three times (lost copies). I've decided to finish it this time because it's been hanging there, a desire that's been unfulfilled and dangling over me for years. Somehow, I need to be free of it, or at least have passed the experience into the history of my reading pleasures. So here I go. 
 William Hurt was a good choice for the audiobook. There's something about his voice that's trance-like and lulls you right in. I'm glad I've decided to finally and fully experience the book in just this way. 
 King himself read the the next two stories in the book. Some reviewers suggested that the other stories were boring, but that wasn't my feel at all. I quite enjoyed them, especially the title story. I can see, however, that someone whose only reason for reading King is action/horror excitement may not find much of value in a book that's mostly composed of nostalgia and a look back at the turning points that shaped us as people. It's not exactly the stuff of horror lore. If you're that sort, you might want to shuffle on and find another book because this one is far too delicate and filled with entirely too much longing for the adventure seeking reader. 
 Hurt returned for the final story. By now, the crossover between all the stories and characters was wrapped up tight and everywhere. It seemed almost like a novel with shifting perspectives over the years. Depending on your point of view, the interconnections could come across as overly-coincidental or just a tidy way of letting us know where things ended up with various people we'd come to know in their youth. I prefer the latter. Actually, I loved touching in on people years later, finding out how they'd turned out without the direct story of it ever really being the point of the story itself. 
 The plain fact is that this book got to me far more than it should have. It was a beautiful novel shaped like short stories and made of youth lost and memory unwound. Maybe it took me so long to actually read it because I needed the years between to lose more and more of my past into the old fireplace of time. Maybe I needed to remember only enough to know how much I'd lost and how beautiful so much of it had been. Maybe it's a book that can only be understood when your life has made the same sorts of strange turns and you look back, wondering, lost, wistful.",54.0,1,4240,8437.6,1.99,1142,4,3,2

By the time she and her lifelong friend Zora begin to inoculate the children there, she feels age-old superstitions and secrets gathering everywhere around her. Secrets her outwardly cheerful hosts have chosen not to tell her. Secrets involving the strange family digging for something in the surrounding vineyards. Secrets hidden in the landscape itself.
But Natalia is also confronting a private, hurtful mystery of her own: the inexplicable circumstances surrounding her beloved grandfather's recent death. After telling her grandmother that he was on his way to meet Natalia, he instead set off for a ramshackle settlement none of their family had ever heard of and died there alone. A famed physician, her grandfather must have known that he was too ill to travel. Why he left home becomes a riddle Natalia is compelled to unravel.
Grief struck and searching for clues to her grandfather's final state of mind, she turns to the stories he told her when she was a child. On their weeklytrips to the zoo he would read to her from a worn copy of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, which he carried with him everywhere; later, he told her stories of his own encounters over many years with ""the deathless man,"" a vagabond who claimed to be immortal and appeared never to age. But the most extraordinary story of all is the one her grandfather never told her, the one Natalia must discover for herself. One winter during the Second World War, his childhood village was snowbound, cut off even from the encroaching German invaders but haunted by another, fierce presence: a tiger who comes ever closer under cover of darkness.

I wanted to give it my fair and undivided attention, and I'm glad I took this approach. 
 So, what did I think after finishing the book? I liked it - mostly. 
 The first half of the book is just a delightful collection of short stories about Jean Louise Finch's life growing up in the Deep South. I loved learning more about ""Scout's"" family - Aunty Alexandra and Uncle Dr. Jack Finch, and I particularly loved the vignette that found their church music director in a quandary on how to present hymn correctly - Jean Louise and Uncle Jack soon helped him puzzle out that problem and get back on the right track! Just a charming tale! 
 And then after chapter 8, things begin to go downhill. There has been much talk about how disappointed people were in the fact that Lee presents Atticus Finch in a very different light than in TKAM - but I found him a very ""human"" character that was just adapting to the times of the day that he lived in. 
 All in all - I love Harper Lee's style of writing - you can almost taste the sawmill gravy smothering the biscuits and smell the perfume of the cape jessamine in the air through her words and for that reason alone should stand the high recommendation to read this novel. It is a work of wonderful Southern fiction that, I'm afraid, will be well known for it's controversy than for it's beautiful writing. I, for one, will treasure it alongside my copy of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" regardless of what others might say.",1.0,0,5500,47795.0,8.69,3,4,4,5

There were some rather deep issues presented here, such as Trixie 'cutting' and the use of date rape drugs, which I felt were dropped into the novel for dramatic effect, but then skirted around when the novel took an entirely different direction.

And yet this gathering is different. Abby and Red are getting older, and decisions must be made about how best to look after them and their beloved family home. They've all come, even Denny, who can usually be relied on only to please himself.
From that porch we spool back through three generations of the Whitshanks, witnessing the events, secrets and unguarded moments that have come to define who and what they are.

It's not like we exit realism to have the staircase opening up to speak or the windows blinking their shutters open and closed, like eyelids. Instead we are given histories of ordinary people who fall in and out of love with this house and with each other. The house bares witness to it all.

It's the early 1980s--the country is in a deep recession, and life after college is harder than ever. In the cafes on College Hill, the wised-up kids are inhaling Derrida and listening to Talking Heads. But Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English major, is writing her senior thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot, purveyors of the marriage plot that lies at the heart of the greatest English novels.
As Madeleine tries to understand why ""it became laughable to read writers like Cheever and Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about deflowering virgins in eighteenth-century France,"" real life, in the form of two very different guys, intervenes. Leonard Bankhead--charismatic loner, college Darwinist, and lost Portland boy--suddenly turns up in a semiotics seminar, and soon Madeleine finds herself in a highly charged erotic and intellectual relationship with him.

Over the next year, as the members of the triangle in this amazing, spellbinding novel graduate from college and enter the real world, events force them to reevaluate everything they learned in school.

What would happen if all the Negroes in the South were suddenly given full civil rights? I'll tell you. There'd be another Reconstruction. Would you want your state governments run by people who don't know how to run 'em? Do you want this town run by--now wait a minute--Willoughby's a crook, we know that, but do you know of any Negro who knows as much as Willoughby? Zeebo'd probably be Mayor of Maycomb. Would you want someone of Zeebo's capability to handle the town's money? We're outnumbered, you know. 
 ""Honey, you do not seem to understand that the Negroes down here are still in their childhood as a people. You should know it, you've seen it all your life. They've made terrific progress in adapting themselves to white ways, but they're far from it yet. They were coming along fine, traveling at a rate they could absorb, more of 'em voting than ever before. Then the NAACP stepped in with its fantastic demands and shoddy ideas of government--can you blame the South for resenting being told what to do about its own people by people who have no idea of its daily problems? 
 I understand that there are a lot of controversy and conspiracy theories regarding the publication of this book, and for good reason. 
 I read To Kill a Mockingbird in 8th grade. It was class reading. I watched the movie starring Gregory Peck, he of the patrician demeanor, he who, indubitably, best portrayed the noble American icon that is Atticus Finch. 
 To tell you the truth, I didn't really understand the book and what it symbolized then. I was in 8th grade. I had arrived in the US just a few years before. My command of the English was good, but as with all younger teens, the symbolism of the book and its significance largely escaped me. I lacked the analytical skills to truly understand what it meant, what a landmark it was in terms of American history. 
 In 8th grade, before reading this book, our class studied American history. We studied slavery, the Civil War. We studied the ugly past of racism and segregation. We studied Martin Luther King. As a newly arrived immigrant, this should have made an impact on me, but again, I was so young that I didn't truly understand the significance. 
 It was only later on, when I was older, that I understood how important this book was, and how remarkable the character of Atticus Finch was. He, and this book is an American institution. A symbol of righteousness in a past filled with racial injustice. A defender of the underdog. 
 Which is why this book, this sequel to the iconic To Kill a Mockingbird is such a disappointment. If I must be honest, it should never have been written, for in this book, the shining beacon that is Atticus Finch has been grossly tarnished. He has now grown old, bitter, and racist. 
 Yes, I understand that people change. We all do. I understand that a good lawyer can present his case regardless of his beliefs, but that's not the point. The point is that Atticus Finch is such an outstanding figure that it feels wrong somehow to blacken his image. No pun intended. 
 I've seen comparisons to how this book is the most anticipated book since the release of Harry Potter. Well, what if J.K. Rowlings had released a sequel to Harry Potter, in which Harry is an old, grumpy man, going through a mid-life crisis, leering at young girls at the gym, cheating on his wife, ignoring his children? 
 Nobody would like that. Some symbols are here to stay. Some things are meant to remain the way they are. Some things should remain pure. The memory of To Kill a Mockingbird and that of Atticus Finch should be one of them. 
 I wish this book had been left to rot as an old, forgotten manuscript in some long-forgotten warehouse. I want to remember Atticus Finch as a paragon. Sometimes, I want simplicity, and I want bliss in ignorance. 
 She heard her father's voice, a tiny voice talking in the warm comfortable past. Gentlemen, if there's one slogan in this world I believe, it is this: equal rights for all, special privileges for none.

Also because without it, I would likely have simply dismissed this book out of hand as genre fiction or, worse, young adult. (This is my particular narrow-minded streak, and it may be keeping me even now from some perfectly fine writing. I have not learned my lesson about it, though, as you will see below.) 
 In any case, I think he's very much on the nose about escapism and readers and how they are at work in this book, and I have little to add on that score*. I do, however, note in perusing others' reactions to it, a new generation of escapism taking hold among those who have decided that Quentin, and with him, Grossman, are somehow misogynists, that this book is not morally pure. 
 It's true that Quentin is a bad boyfriend. He's callow, and selfish, and he cheats on his girlfriend for no reason, hurts her deeply, and then, when she sleeps with someone else, feels angry and hurt in turn, despite having done the same thing to her. He drinks too much, he has no real purpose, he thinks very little about other people except in relation to himself, he's status conscious, he hates himself, and he's difficult to love, and has a hard time loving others. I wouldn't want him to be my boyfriend (but then again, I'm also not 20, just post-college, and drifting.) But none of that makes him a misogynist, and it certainly doesn't make the author one for depicting him in all his dysfunctional glory. Empathizing with him, even; though I would argue that the ability to empathize is part of the novelist's charge, and part of the reader's. There's a deeply ungenerous and problematic view of relationships here, and of people, and of politics, and of literature, and I see it growing, everywhere, all the time, and it makes me angry, sad, and more than a little afraid. 
 Relationships are not a contract. Certainly the feelings that they occasion are not. You can't seriously say to a person, ooops, you're in the wrong, so you cede all rights, on the inside of your head, to be ever hurt or upset, to ever feel betrayed or jealous. Maybe you have no right to CLAIM certain things as a result of your feelings, but to feel them to begin with? Feelings can't be governed by contract, and morality doesn't work like a contract in any case. This kind of judgment is insane. OF COURSE Quentin is still jealous, even though he's in the wrong. What would a book where he wasn't even look like? What would he look like? The beast that eats people's hands? 
 Also, this is not about feminism. I've been wanting to say this for a long time to a good many people. Going through works of fiction, finding men you don't like (which appears to be nearly all of them at this count) and then loudly condemning them on social media, even though they don't even exist, IS NOT FEMINISM. I'm a 45 year old woman and I've been a feminist all my life and I am not ceding that title to this big pack of whiny, useless, spoiled children who don't know the difference between words and actions, depicting something and endorsing it, fiction and reality. You kids can get the hell off my lawn. 
 And about literature. I'm not sure what an approved literature would look like, but I'm starting to think that these twinned desires -- a consumerism which says you get it how you want it, even for art, and an terrifying neo-puritanism that condemns every human failing as though it were a genocide -- are responsible for the plague of adults reading children's books**. Because if what people want is a morally sanitized, grossly oversimplified fantasy where everyone you don't like or disagree with is either a convert or the vanquished by the end, and you get to be a princess, you can't do better than Narnia. This book is exactly about that readerly impulse, and today's neo-puritans are no different than Lewis's cranky christianity***. It's easier to condemn Grossman as morally objectionable than it is to enter into this problem with him and discuss it, but that doesn't mean it's the right response. 
 I'm going to get and read the other two books in this series, and I'm going to do it for my own pleasure and also for spite. Then maybe I'll read a little Jonathan Franzen, pissing off people from a variety of positions on the ideological spectrum, split a couple of infinitives, and finish everything up by doing a little dance. 
 *Warwick is, as should be obvious, in no way responsible for the opinions in the rant that follows, which are mine and mine alone. 
 **ooops, there it is again, my narrow-minded streak, someone somewhere is reeling for the painful force of those words as though they were a bullet, someone somewhere is harmed by that bit of dangerous speech, it's practically like I killed a man! 
 ***Ironic little side note: I also read a couple of reviews of Lewis's original books which condemn THEM as misogynist as well. Much as I think he's an ideological simpleton and a total killjoy, this is one area where he seems perfectly unobjectionable. You really have to be looking for the offense to find it.

This is the way Abby Whitshank always begins the story of how she and Red fell in love that summer's day in 1959. The whole family on the porch, half-listening as their mother tells the same tale they have heard so many times before.
From that porch we spool back through the generations, witnessing the events, secrets and unguarded moments that have come to define the family. From Red's father and mother, newly arrived in Baltimore in the 1920s, to Abby and Red's grandchildren carrying the family legacy boisterously into the twenty-first century - four generations of Whitshanks, their lives unfolding in and around the sprawling, lovingly worn Baltimore house that has always been their home...

 We all have them don't we, that dish we turn to when feeling blue or just wanting to revel in hearth and home. For me that dish has always been beefaroni, not the Chef Boyardee shit, but real homemade beefaroni. Follow up a big dish of that, with warm Dutch apple pie and vanilla ice cream, paired with a glass of the good stuff, slippers on my tootsies and a good book and colour me content and life good. 
 Reading A Spool of Blue Thread brought these images to mind readily. It is a story about family, four generations of Whitshank's and their Baltimore home with its grand and sprawling, full-length front porch. As we enter this story it is a late July evening and Red and Abby who occupy the house on Bouton Road are preparing to turn in for the evening when they receive a phone call from their son Denny. Denny is the best looking of Red and Abby's four children and the one that has caused Abby the greatest amount of worry. 
 Which was not to say that Denny was bad. He was far more generous, for instance, than the other three put together. (He traded his new bike for a kitten when Jeannie's beloved cat died.) And he didn't bully other children, or throw tantrums. But he was so close-mouthed. He had these spells of unexplained obstinacy, where his face would grow set and pinched and no one could get through to him. It seemed to be a kind of inward tantrum; it seemed his anger turned in upon itself and hardened him or froze him. Red threw up his hands when that happened and stomped off, but Abby couldn't let him be. She just had to jostle him out of it. She wanted her loved ones happy! 
 This was such an absorbing read; one might think I was reading about my own family. Every day life, every day moments, spanning three generations of the Whitshank family. As Zoeytron says in her spot on review, ""It's a quiet tale, well told."" There is no grand plot, no nail biting suspense, just a heart warming story of one family that could just as easily be your own. I was completely drawn in, compulsively reading, so in tune it seemed with everyone's thoughts and feelings and oh so reluctant for the book to end. This friends, is comfort food for the soul.

1288,The Tiger’S Wife,Tea Obreht,2011,2011,"Weaving a brilliant latticework of family legend, loss, and love, Tea Obreht, the youngest of The New Yorker's twenty best American fiction writers under forty, has spun a timeless novel that will establish her as one of the most vibrant, original authors of her generation.
In a Balkan country mending from years of conflict, Natalia, a young doctor, arrives on a mission of mercy at an orphanage by the sea. By the time she and her lifelong friend Zora begin to inoculate the children there, she feels age-old superstitions and secrets gathering everywhere around her. Secrets her outwardly cheerful hosts have chosen not to tell her. Secrets involving the strange family digging for something in the surrounding vineyards. Secrets hidden in the landscape itself.
But Natalia is also confronting a private, hurtful mystery of her own: the inexplicable circumstances surrounding her beloved grandfather's recent death. After telling her grandmother that he was on his way to meet Natalia, he instead set off for a ramshackle settlement none of their family had ever heard of and died there alone. A famed physician, her grandfather must have known that he was too ill to travel. Why he left home becomes a riddle Natalia is compelled to unravel.
Grief struck and searching for clues to her grandfather's final state of mind, she turns to the stories he told her when she was a child. On their weeklytrips to the zoo he would read to her from a worn copy of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, which he carried with him everywhere; later, he told her stories of his own encounters over many years with ""the deathless man,"" a vagabond who claimed to be immortal and appeared never to age. But the most extraordinary story of all is the one her grandfather never told her, the one Natalia must discover for herself. One winter during the Second World War, his childhood village was snowbound, cut off even from the encroaching German invaders but haunted by another, fierce presence: a tiger who comes ever closer under cover of darkness. ""These stories,"" Natalia comes to understand, ""run like secret rivers through all the other stories"" of her grandfather's life. And it is ultimately within these rich, luminous narratives that she will find the answer she is looking for.",Fiction,Novice,4,6,13,9.75,9,3.37,66742,1.0,"Thank goodness for other reviewers with more patience than me - I was able to understand more about the book in an hour browsing the discussion/review pages on Goodreads than 3 weeks wrestling with the Tiger. After checking others views on the book to make sure it wasn't entirely my fault that the Tiger and I didn't bond, here's the criticisms I still maintain: 
 And using bullet points, because I love 'em: 
 - The fables: It's not that I can't do magical realism, I absolutely can. Marquez; Allende; Esquivel; Saramago; Yes please, serve me up. It's not even that 'The Deathless Man' and 'The Tiger's Wife' are empty stories - the opposite in fact. The problem is a) the stilted nature in which the fables are told b) the link between the two central fables being so precarious as to be utterly unconvincing - is it magic realism or isn't it? I don't think Obreht can decide and c) the fables are buried, to the extent that you feel as though they are being deliberately concealed from you, in a mountain of pointless (though A+) descriptions about inanimate objects (I'll get to that later, it deserves its own bullet point). 
 - Boredom: Other brave reviewers have already said it; even ones who have been so generous as to still dole out 3 and 4 stars. And that is that it all feels a bit pointless. What's the story actually about? What am I left with (apart from a headache?). If you ask me in two weeks I flat out just won't know. 
 - ""A lack of emotion"": (That's actually a quote from the The Guardian's review). Lets use some concrete examples. Natalia and Zora? Their friendship, apparently as old as they are, has about as much depth to it as puddle of water. Why wouldn't Natalia share the news of her Grandfather's death with her so-called ""best friend""? What life experiences had they been through that made them the kind of kids that get kicks out of dissecting, in fairly gruesome circumstances, pigs hearts? Not your average teenage girls, surely - but we wouldn't know because Natalia tells us nothing about what makes her tick (let alone the elusive chain-smoking Zora). And Natalia's Grandfather, arguably the most important character in the book - why are there great gaping holes in what we know about his life? We have such incredible (read ""bbbooooring"") detail surrounding Luka, his mother, his brothers, his father, his musical aspirations, his ten year sabbatical and tragic love songs that aren't even borne out of his own experiences, and for what? I think it is supposed to explain why he ultimately turned into a henous wife-beating monster. Er, sorry, no - it doesn't actually. Just as all the inane detail (pages and pages) about Darisa The Bear's childhood and how it shaped him in becoming a hunter of such great repute in later life - I still fail to see how any of this early detail was relevant to the whole of the story. Or maybe there was no point, and that is the point - ""we're just telling stories"". Oh, Ok!! But, just so you know, it's freaking boring! In my view, the balance of power in this novel is held by the wrong characters - the depth is given to stories that frankly don't deserve it, while complete superficiality (at best) is all that is afforded to the stories that actually matter. 
 - The long, long-winded descriptions: Yes, Obreht can write. If this is an exercise in cramming adjectives into sentences (or WOW words, as we call them in Year 2), yep, she succeeded. And she's 25, the youngest ever Orange Prize winner. Ok, I get it, she's talented! But what use is this without a real life actual story to tell? (see above). Primarily, Obreht's talent is directed towards describing places, objects, and events, (without emotion, as I said before) in the kind of detail only God would notice. And THAT there is probably my main criticism of the book - because remember, we're dealing with a first person narrative. I'm sorry, but a person does not walk into a room and take notice of the way a painting sits half an inch to the left on a wall covered in a fine film of whoknowswhat while some animal scratches beneath the heavy brown floor boards, the ones with the rusty nails protruding out of them threateningly. Here's an example (much better than mine, naturally). 
 ""The street below dead-ended in a flattened patch of pale grass, bordered on either side by netless goal frames. A slide and some tire swings had been set up on the lip of a wheat field that caught the afternoon light and held it in a shivering glare. Beyond that lay the graveyard, white crosses turned out toward the sea. The wind had subsided, and the road was deserted except for a single motted goat, tethered to the fence post of what looked like an enormous metal box opposite the clinic. The BEER sign braced against an oil drum under the awning was to be believed, this was the bar"". 
 Well written? Yes. Riveting? No. Even more implausibly, the vast majority of the time Natalia is recalling this detail based on what she has heard second, third, even fourth hand - or from her grandfather eons earlier. Even if I am to suppose Natalia has some super-human memory that allows her to recall all these minor threads in minute detail, I can't get past the idea that anyone walks around (doing nothing, going nowhere) ""thinking"" to themselves this way. I admit plenty of excellent books combine first person narrative with contextual descriptions of scene or atmosophere (I just finished When God Was a Rabbit - perfect example of the right balance) - but it's usually very subtle. Broken up with dialogue, events, oooh, I don't know - something actually happening once in a while. But Obreht's descriptive passages can go on for pages and pages and none of it adds anything at all to the PLOT (it's not an evil word people). It reminded me of reading a police report, or court transcript. A flowery one, to be sure, but that is the kind mundane observations and recollection of events that you're wading through. I needed more action, more convincing dialogue. Natalia was a person herself without a story, without a VOICE of her own; how ironic is that, being that it's a story about stories. And then when Natalia gets on to recounting what she's been able to glean from the memories of the villagers still living today, and also from her Grandfather based on what he told her before he died, that's when my raised eyebrow really begins to hurt. It's woolly and impossible to tether. 
 - And then there's the grating fact that it's devoid of place. The country, the city, the warring factions, all nameless. Why? Why? Why? 
 I probably didn't need to write such a long review. Goodness knows I already want the last three weeks of precious book reading time back. I could have just said ""when you have to go to Goodreads and read several other reviews to work out what the book was really saying, there's a problem"".",389.0,1,2916,2886.84,0.99,936,3,2,2
1289,Luckiest Girl Alive,Jessica Knoll,2015,2015,"HER PERFECT LIFE IS A PERFECT LIE.
As a teenager at the prestigious Bradley School, Ani FaNelli endured a shocking, public humiliation that left her desperate to reinvent herself. Now, with a glamorous job, expensive wardrobe, and handsome blue blood fiance, she's this close to living the perfect life she's worked so hard to achieve.
But Ani has a secret.
There's something else buried in her past that still haunts her, something private and painful that threatens to bubble to the surface and destroy everything.
With a singular voice and twists you won't see coming, Luckiest Girl Alive explores the unbearable pressure that so many women feel to ""have it all"" and introduces a heroine whose sharp edges and cutthroat ambition have been protecting a scandalous truth, and a heart that's bigger than it first appears.
The question remains: will breaking her silence destroy all that she has worked for--or, will it at long last, set Ani free?",Fiction,Novice,16,7,14,11.125,1,3.48,85136,2.0,"""She didn't have anything in her teeth."" 
 I took my time leaning over the table, slurped my wine from the rim to spare my white jeans. Never fuck with a rich white bitch and her white jeans. ""Not in her teeth. Up her ass, on the other hand . . ."" 
 Luke's laugh was the standing ovation. He shook his head, impressed. ""You can be pretty vicious, you know?"" 
 This book was sold with a blurb as being ""for fans of Gone Girl."" With all due respect, there is no comparison. It is more The Devil Meets Prada or Four Blondes than anything else. At best, it is the poor man's Gone Girl, a fake $5 knockoff of the original. 
 There is no arguing who is the superior writer. Flynn's words have more power. Knoll's words feel emotionless. Paraphrased. Here is a comparison of two paragraphs. 
 First, Flynn: 
 ""Men always say that as the defining compliment, don't they? She's a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she's hosting the world's biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. 
 Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they're fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men - friends, coworkers, strangers - giddy over these awful pretender women, and I'd want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who'd like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I'd want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn't really love chili dogs that much - no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They're not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they're pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. 
 Now, Knoll: 
 Pretty girls had to appear as though they weren't trying to be pretty, which I had made the fatal mistake of doing at Bradley. There were times Nell went out in her father's polo, nasty old Uggs, and sweatpants, no makeup, just to prove her loyalty resided with her own gender. Pretty girls also had to have a self-deprecating sense of humor and point out when they had a blistering pimple and talk about their explosive diarrhea to assure other girls that they weren't interested in the role of man-eating minx. 
 As you can see, there is no comparison as to whose words are far more effective. 
 This book dealt with some very difficult issues, issues like rape and eating disorders, but it didn't deal with them well. The issues were dealt with dismissively, the narrator discussed them with as much emotion as if she was telling us about her last SoulCycle class. 
 I understand that everyone deals with these issues in a different way. Some dismiss them, try not to think about them. Others dwell on their pain. A good book that deals with these issue tell the story of the character--the victim---in such a way as to make the reader empathize with what they have gone through. However the character deals with their past, be it downright ""I'm going to pretend it never happened"" to ""I can't stop thinking about it. This is killing me,"" the reader should FEEL it. 
 This did not happen in this book. You may argue that this is the main character's way of dealing with things, that I should infer it through her experience. Well, with all due respect, fuck that shit, this is a book. It is not the reader's burden to infer everything. If that's the case, you might as well hand me a blank book with two characters names typed on it and have me infer 600 pages. I don't think so. 
 As a narrator, the main character, the rather unfortunately named TifAni FaNelli, ""Ani"" (pronounced aaaaaaahh-nee), is a highly irritating one. She has one tone: glib. Again, there is zero emotion in anything she describes, from her work, to her past, to her relationships, to her descriptions of the people in her life. 
 Speaking of the people in her life, they are no better. Every single one of them is one-dimensional. Ani herself is materialistic, bitchy, constantly criticizing of others (hint: she doesn't like anyone). All the men in the book are arrogant assholes, easily manipulable if one just say the right things, offer the right promises, offer them that little bit of excitement, be the lady in the living room, the cook in the kitchen, the whore in the bedroom. All the women in the book are competitors. 
 His wife, body mean with Equinox muscles, cheery blond hair swept away from her face in a ninety-dollar blow-out. I always eye the wife first; I like to know what I'm up against. She was wearing the typical Kate uniform: white jeans, nude wedges, and a silky, sleeveless top. Hot pink, I'm sure she spent a few minutes debating it--was she tan enough, maybe the navy silky sleeveless top instead, can't go wrong with navy--and over her shoulder, a cognac Prada the exact same shade as her shoes, the perfect match more age revealing than the skin starting to pucker in her neck. She had at least ten years on me, I determined, relieved. I don't know how I'm going to live with myself when I turn thirty. 
 None of the women eat. They're all medicated up the yin-yang, spray-tanned, Botoxed Bergdorf blondes whose greatest desire in life is the ring, the husband in finance, the designer child, the summer house in Nantucket. The artificiality of it would be humorous, except that everything in this book reeks with tension-filled misery. 
 Ani's life is a giant parade in which she is the showpiece. She is clearly miserable, her life is one of an underfed bird in a gilded cage, and I have no idea why she strives so hard to maintain it. 
 Ani has as much personality as a gluten-free piece of bread. She is ""shocking"" to the upper class, and to the reader, because of her sexual proclivities. Hearing her describe her good qualities is simply pitiful. 
 I'm pretty--I have to work at it, but the raw materials are there. I'm four years Luke's junior, which isn't as good as eight, but still, something. I also like to do ""weird"" things in bed. Even though Luke and I have very different definitions of ""weird"" (him: doggy style and hair pulling, me: electric shocks to my pussy with a ball gag in my mouth to stifle my screams), by his standards, we have a freaky, fulfilling sex life 
 And it's not a pitiful as in ""poor girl, she has so much going for her, but she doesn't realize her full potential,"" as much as it is ""wow, what a sorry excuse for a human being. But really, what's between her legs is more interesting than what's in between her head, which is, frankly, nothing at all. 
 There is a severe disconnect between her and the reader. As a result, I have no empathy for her. I have no emotional connection with her. I do not feel her pain. I find her story boring. I find what happened to her---as atrocious as it was---to be little more than an afterthought. 
 The story is so, so dull. How can a revenge story hold so little interest? Well, read this book, and you will see how. The narrative is disruptive, jumping from her teens to her current ""perfect"" life, and frankly, both timelines bore the fuck out of me.",355.0,1,5670,54205.2,9.56,430,4,2,2
1290,Go Set A Watchman,Harper Lee,2015,2015,"From Harper Lee comes a landmark new novel set two decades after her beloved Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece, To Kill a Mockingbird. Maycomb, Alabama.

Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise's homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town and the people dearest to her.

What would happen if all the Negroes in the South were suddenly given full civil rights? I'll tell you. There'd be another Reconstruction. Would you want your state governments run by people who don't know how to run 'em? Do you want this town run by--now wait a minute--Willoughby's a crook, we know that, but do you know of any Negro who knows as much as Willoughby? Zeebo'd probably be Mayor of Maycomb. Would you want someone of Zeebo's capability to handle the town's money? We're outnumbered, you know. 
 ""Honey, you do not seem to understand that the Negroes down here are still in their childhood as a people. You should know it, you've seen it all your life. They've made terrific progress in adapting themselves to white ways, but they're far from it yet.

Then the NAACP stepped in with its fantastic demands and shoddy ideas of government--can you blame the South for resenting being told what to do about its own people by people who have no idea of its daily problems? 
 I understand that there are a lot of controversy and conspiracy theories regarding the publication of this book, and for good reason. 
 I read To Kill a Mockingbird in 8th grade. It was class reading. I watched the movie starring Gregory Peck, he of the patrician demeanor, he who, indubitably, best portrayed the noble American icon that is Atticus Finch. 
 To tell you the truth, I didn't really understand the book and what it symbolized then. I was in 8th grade. I had arrived in the US just a few years before. My command of the English was good, but as with all younger teens, the symbolism of the book and its significance largely escaped me. I lacked the analytical skills to truly understand what it meant, what a landmark it was in terms of American history. 
 In 8th grade, before reading this book, our class studied American history. We studied slavery, the Civil War. We studied the ugly past of racism and segregation. We studied Martin Luther King. As a newly arrived immigrant, this should have made an impact on me, but again, I was so young that I didn't truly understand the significance. 
 It was only later on, when I was older, that I understood how important this book was, and how remarkable the character of Atticus Finch was. He, and this book is an American institution. A symbol of righteousness in a past filled with racial injustice. A defender of the underdog. 
 Which is why this book, this sequel to the iconic To Kill a Mockingbird is such a disappointment. If I must be honest, it should never have been written, for in this book, the shining beacon that is Atticus Finch has been grossly tarnished. He has now grown old, bitter, and racist. 
 Yes, I understand that people change. We all do. I understand that a good lawyer can present his case regardless of his beliefs, but that's not the point. The point is that Atticus Finch is such an outstanding figure that it feels wrong somehow to blacken his image. No pun intended. 
 I've seen comparisons to how this book is the most anticipated book since the release of Harry Potter. Well, what if J.K. Rowlings had released a sequel to Harry Potter, in which Harry is an old, grumpy man, going through a mid-life crisis, leering at young girls at the gym, cheating on his wife, ignoring his children? 
 Nobody would like that. Some symbols are here to stay. Some things are meant to remain the way they are. Some things should remain pure. The memory of To Kill a Mockingbird and that of Atticus Finch should be one of them. 
 I wish this book had been left to rot as an old, forgotten manuscript in some long-forgotten warehouse. I want to remember Atticus Finch as a paragon. Sometimes, I want simplicity, and I want bliss in ignorance.

 On a more serious note, yes, this is The Fountainhead for Big Data. If Sonny Mehta had called up Dave Eggers and offered him 100,000 shares of Facebook to write a The Fountainhead for Big Data it couldn't have turned out much differently from this book. The Circle is as manipulative, intellectually bankrupt, and cardboard character-filled as Ayn Rand's book, which means it has none of the things that I look for in a novel. 
 However, in keeping with one of the themes hammered home again and again and again in this book, I don't necessarily want all novels that I read to feel as if they were written for me and my tastes. Eggers' and Rand's novels are striking and extreme, and we need striking and extreme novels along with all the rest. 
 Any engineer who leaves this book shaking his/her head at another high-profile Luddite who JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES AND DAY TO DAY OF REAL LIFE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT should think of a novel like this as rapid prototyping for reality. Eggers is hacking together something purposefully bad hoping to get as many people as he can to stop, read, and admit that we really don't want this to be our future, right, right, RIGHT? 
 I think most of the people leaving one-star ratings and all of those leaving five-star ratings of this book would nod, Mae-like, yes.

 Which was not to say that Denny was bad. He was far more generous, for instance, than the other three put together. (He traded his new bike for a kitten when Jeannie's beloved cat died.) And he didn't bully other children, or throw tantrums. But he was so close-mouthed. He had these spells of unexplained obstinacy, where his face would grow set and pinched and no one could get through to him. It seemed to be a kind of inward tantrum; it seemed his anger turned in upon itself and hardened him or froze him. Red threw up his hands when that happened and stomped off, but Abby couldn't let him be. She just had to jostle him out of it. She wanted her loved ones happy! 
 This was such an absorbing read; one might think I was reading about my own family. Every day life, every day moments, spanning three generations of the Whitshank family. As Zoeytron says in her spot on review, ""It's a quiet tale, well told."" There is no grand plot, no nail biting suspense, just a heart warming story of one family that could just as easily be your own. I was completely drawn in, compulsively reading, so in tune it seemed with everyone's thoughts and feelings and oh so reluctant for the book to end. This friends, is comfort food for the soul.

1293,The Tenth Circle,Jodi Picoult,2006,2006,"Jodi Picoult,the New York Timesbestselling author of Vanishing Acts,offers her most powerful chronicle yet of an American family with a story that probes the unbreakable bond between parent and child -- and the dangerous repercussions of trying to play the hero.
Trixie Stone is fourteen years old and in love for the first time. She's also the light of her father's life -- a straight-A student; a freshman in high school who is pretty and popular; a girl who's always looked up to Daniel Stone as a hero. Until, that is, her world is turned upside down with a single act of violence...and suddenly everything Trixie has believed about her family -- and herself -- seems to be a lie.
For fifteen years, Daniel Stone has been an even-tempered, mild-mannered man: a stay-at-home dad to Trixie and a husband who has put his own career as a comic book artist behind that of his wife, Laura, who teaches Dante's Infernoat a local college. But years ago, he was completely different: growing up as the only white boy in an Eskimo village, he was teased mercilessly for the color of his skin. He learned to fight back: stealing, drinking, robbing, and cheating his way out of the Alaskan bush. To become part of a family, he reinvented himself, channeling his rage onto the page and burying his past completely...until now. Could the young boy who once made Trixie's face fill with light when he came to the door have been the one to end her childhood forever? She says that he is, and that is all it takes to make Daniel, a man with a history he has hidden even from his family, venture to hell and back in order to protect his daughter.
The Tenth Circlelooks at that delicate moment when a child learns that her parents don't know all of the answers and when being a good parent means letting go of your child. It asks whether you can reinvent yourself in the course of a lifetime or if your mistakes are carried forever -- if life is, as in any good comic book, a struggle to control good and evil, or if good and evil control you.",Fiction,Novice,7,2,14,7.428571428571429,1,3.48,600,1.0,"We can't keep Jodi Picoult on the shelves in the bookstore where I work. I picked this one up just to see what all the fuss is about and before I knew what was happening I was a hundred pages into it. 
 Picoult's great strength seems to lie in creating a suspenseful build-up as the reader waits for Devastating Tragedy to descend on her characters. Unfortunately, she doesn't seem to know what to do after that and covers up by adding one big 'dramatic' plot twist after another. 
 It could have been saved if the characters had more than one dimension. Apparently, that was too much to hope for. 
 Eventually I did managed to drag myself to the end of this book at which point I was left feeling resentful over the time I wasted reading it.",21.0,1,5940,106801.2,17.98,409,5,2,1
1294,Death Comes To Pemberley,P. D. James,2011,2011,"The world is classic Jane Austen. The mystery is vintage P.D. James.
The year is 1803, and Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet have been married for six years. There are now two handsome and healthy sons in the nursery, Elizabeth's beloved sister Jane and her husband Bingley live nearby and the orderly world of Pemberley seems unassailable. But all this is threatened when, on the eve of the annual autumn ball, the guests are preparing to retire for the night when a chaise appears, rocking down the path from Pemberley's wild woodland. As it pulls up, Lydia Wickham - Elizabeth Bennet's younger, unreliable sister - stumbles out screaming that her husband has been murdered.
Two great literary minds - master of suspense P.D. James and literary icon Jane Austen - come together in Death Comes to Pemberley, a bestselling historical crime fiction tribute to Pride and Prejudice. Conjuring the world of Elizabeth Bennet and Mark Darcy and combining the trappings of Regency British society with a classic murder mystery, James creates a delightful mash-up that will intrigue any Janeite.
From the bestselling author of The Murder Room, Children of Men and A Certain Justice, comes a wonderful mixture of the nation's greatest romance and best-loved crime fiction. In 2013, this novel was adapted as a miniseries by the BBC, starring Matthew Rhys as Darcy, Anna Maxwell Martin as Elizabeth Bennet and Jenna Coleman as Lydia Wickham.",Fiction,Novice,13,3,12,5.615384615384615,1,3.21,67065,4.0,"I considered mounting a passionate defense in favor of this lovingly-rendered tribute to Jane Austen, but then I decided I couldn't care less what the naysayers think. If you pick up this gentle whodunit expecting the sartorial sleuthing of Commander Adam Dalgliesh, you will be disappointed. If you read this looking for the ghost of Jane Austen, you will catch but a glimpse of her delicate frame. Although the point of fan-fiction escapes me entirely (I can't help but think of tribute bands; I have no more desire to explore fan-fiction than I would to see my approaching-middle-age cohorts belt out Whitesnake's greatest hits), Death Comes to Pemberley reads like a tender squeeze of affection from one national literary treasure to another. 
 If you do sink into this literary treat, know that your Jane ear will delight in the recaptured cadence of her prose and that you will be enchanted by the sense and sensibilities of Regency Britain. You will encounter familiar names and faces from across the Austen oeuvre; you will be moved by James's piquant touches of the political and social realities of the era. 
 If you aren't able to let go and enjoy Death Comes to Pemberley within its opening pages, put it down, walk away and spend your time reading something better suited to your expectations.

1295,Beowulf,translated by Seamus Heaney,2000,2001,"The national bestseller and winner of the Whitbread Award. Composed toward the end of the first millennium, Beowulf is the classic Northern epic of a hero's triumphs as a young warrior and his fated death as a defender of his people. The poem is about encountering the monstrous, defeating it, and then having to live on, physically and psychically exposed in the exhausted aftermath. It is not hard to draw parallels in this story to the historical curve of consciousness in the twentieth century, but the poem also transcends such considerations, telling us psychological and spiritual truths that are permanent and liberating.
Beowulf is considered to have been composed between the 8th and the early 11th century. According to Wikipedia, it was first PUBLISHED in 1814 in a version by John Josias Conybeare.",Fiction,Novice,10,8,17,10.9,2,3.42,159931,4.0,"Beowulf is thought to have been written around the year 1000 AD, give or take a century. And the author is the extremely famous, very popular and world renowned writer... Unknown. Got you there, didn't I? LOL Probably not... if you're on Goodreads and studied American or English literature, you probably already knew this is one of the most famous works without an author. 
 It was first really published in the 1800s, using the Old English version where many have translated it, but there are still some blurry parts of the story. Essentially, a monster named Grendel hunts and kills the people of a town and many warriors have died fighting against it. Beowulf tackles the monster and its mother, and well... you're gonna have to read it to find out. Or if you can't get yourself there, watch the Star Trek or Simpsons episode which does a nice little rendition. 
 Here's the reasons why you should take a look at the story: 
 1. Many famous writers and editors have attempted to translate the story into more modern English. Tolkien is a famous example. Each reader has his/her own interpretation. So pick one whose style you like and go to that version. 
 2. It's a translated book... other than the famous Greek literature we read in high school, it's one of the earliest translated forms of literature. Makes it worth taking a gander. 
 3. It's a really great story. Monster terrorizes people. Someone strong steps up to fight it. There is a victory of sorts. Momma wants revenge. So... how many books have you read that have just copied... I mean borrowed... that entire plot? 
 4. There is a lot of beauty in the prose and the verse, and when you hear the words describe the creatures, it's a bit like fantasy. 
 Here's why you may not like it: 
 1. It's long. 
 2. It's hard to understand at some points. 
 3. It's 1000 years old and you just like modern stories. 
 My advice... pick a passage or two, read for 30 minutes and decide if it's something you want to read more of. But you should always give a chance to some part of our early heritage and culture. Right?

1296,The Circle,Dave Eggers,2013,2013,"When Mae Holland is hired to work for the Circle, the world's most powerful internet company, she feels she's been given the opportunity of a lifetime. The Circle, run out of a sprawling California campus, links users' personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a new age of civility and transparency.
As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company's modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO.
Mae can't believe her luck, her great fortune to work for the most influential company in America - even as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public. What begins as the captivating story of one woman's ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge.",Fiction,Novice,4,7,15,10.75,15,3.45,115729,3.0,"A Review of Dave Eggers' The Circle by Google 
 Transparency is... 
 Surveillance is... 
 Society is... 
 Kayaking is... 
 Cults are... 
 Everything in moderation, including... 
 Cynicism is...

 On a more serious note, yes, this is The Fountainhead for Big Data. If Sonny Mehta had called up Dave Eggers and offered him 100,000 shares of Facebook to write a The Fountainhead for Big Data it couldn't have turned out much differently from this book. The Circle is as manipulative, intellectually bankrupt, and cardboard character-filled as Ayn Rand's book, which means it has none of the things that I look for in a novel. 
 However, in keeping with one of the themes hammered home again and again and again in this book, I don't necessarily want all novels that I read to feel as if they were written for me and my tastes. Eggers' and Rand's novels are striking and extreme, and we need striking and extreme novels along with all the rest. 
 Any engineer who leaves this book shaking his/her head at another high-profile Luddite who JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES AND DAY TO DAY OF REAL LIFE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT should think of a novel like this as rapid prototyping for reality. Eggers is hacking together something purposefully bad hoping to get as many people as he can to stop, read, and admit that we really don't want this to be our future, right, right, RIGHT? 
 I think most of the people leaving one-star ratings and all of those leaving five-star ratings of this book would nod, Mae-like, yes.

At the start of summer, a lonely and thoughtful teenager, Evie Boyd, sees a group of girls in the park, and is immediately caught by their freedom, their careless dress, their dangerous aura of abandon. Soon, Evie is in thrall to Suzanne, a mesmerizing older girl, and is drawn into the circle of a soon-to-be infamous cult and the man who is its charismatic leader. Hidden in the hills, their sprawling ranch is eerie and run down, but to Evie, it is exotic, thrilling, charged--a place where she feels desperate to be accepted. As she spends more time away from her mother and the rhythms of her daily life, and as her obsession with Suzanne intensifies, Evie does not realize she is coming closer and closer to unthinkable violence, and to that moment in a girl's life when everything can go horribly wrong.",Fiction,Novice,11,2,11,5.090909090909091,4,3.48,84357,2.0,"I'm turning a corner here, Goodreaders.

 At least for this review. 
 People I know, love, and respect really, really like this book. I completely get it, too. I absolutely understand how you could read this book and think it's amazing and get all caught up in the story and the characters and be transported back to that crazy time in our nation's history. 
 I just didn't connect with this book at any point, ever. I wanted to. I felt like I should have. I just didn't. I read it, never really cared, got to the end, shrugged, got off the couch, and made myself a sandwich. 
 The sandwich thing happens after I finish every book, not just bad ones, and especially not just this one. Sometimes it's cereal or maybe an apple, but who really cares about my post-reading eating habits that may or may not be really a thing anyway? 
 Feel free to message me for more info. 
 I read Helter Skelter in high school and that book was... way too long for a high school kid to read. I mean, it was a great read, fascinating, unbelievable, hard to even rationalize that it was a real event. Crazy. 
 This stupid book... Wait, I'm turning a corner... 
 This book took real events, changed the characters names, and did nothing creative outside of that. It was fine, I guess. It's not worth whatever advance she got from Random House, and it's not worth the attention it's getting. It's not written very well, often comes across as too pretentious and trying too hard to be awesome, and ultimately forgettable. 
 Sorry... I'm trying to change.... 
 Hang on... 
 But, people like it and that's great. Sometimes books don't grab me the same way, and The Girls and I had a bad first date and still tried to make it work. It was doomed from the start, but I read it, it was short, and I can now move on to other books.

Quentin Coldwater is brilliant but miserable. A senior in high school, he's still secretly preoccupied with a series of fantasy novels he read as a child, set in a magical land called Fillory. Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery.
He also discovers all the other things people learn in college: friendship, love, sex, booze, and boredom. Something is missing, though. Magic doesn't bring Quentin the happiness and adventure he dreamed it would. After graduation he and his friends make a stunning discovery: Fillory is real. But the land of Quentin's fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he could have imagined. His childhood dream becomes a nightmare with a shocking truth at its heart.
At once psychologically piercing and magnificently absorbing, The Magicians boldly moves into uncharted literary territory, imagining magic as practiced by real people, with their capricious desires and volatile emotions.

Trixie Stone is fourteen years old and in love for the first time. She's also the light of her father's life -- a straight-A student; a freshman in high school who is pretty and popular; a girl who's always looked up to Daniel Stone as a hero. Until, that is, her world is turned upside down with a single act of violence...and suddenly everything Trixie has believed about her family -- and herself -- seems to be a lie.
For fifteen years, Daniel Stone has been an even-tempered, mild-mannered man: a stay-at-home dad to Trixie and a husband who has put his own career as a comic book artist behind that of his wife, Laura, who teaches Dante's Infernoat a local college. But years ago, he was completely different: growing up as the only white boy in an Eskimo village, he was teased mercilessly for the color of his skin. He learned to fight back: stealing, drinking, robbing, and cheating his way out of the Alaskan bush. To become part of a family, he reinvented himself, channeling his rage onto the page and burying his past completely...until now. Could the young boy who once made Trixie's face fill with light when he came to the door have been the one to end her childhood forever? She says that he is, and that is all it takes to make Daniel, a man with a history he has hidden even from his family, venture to hell and back in order to protect his daughter.
The Tenth Circlelooks at that delicate moment when a child learns that her parents don't know all of the answers and when being a good parent means letting go of your child.

It's the early 1980s--the country is in a deep recession, and life after college is harder than ever. In the cafes on College Hill, the wised-up kids are inhaling Derrida and listening to Talking Heads. But Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English major, is writing her senior thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot, purveyors of the marriage plot that lies at the heart of the greatest English novels.
As Madeleine tries to understand why ""it became laughable to read writers like Cheever and Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about deflowering virgins in eighteenth-century France,"" real life, in the form of two very different guys, intervenes. Leonard Bankhead--charismatic loner, college Darwinist, and lost Portland boy--suddenly turns up in a semiotics seminar, and soon Madeleine finds herself in a highly charged erotic and intellectual relationship with him. At the same time, her old ""friend"" Mitchell Grammaticus--who's been reading Christian mysticism and generally acting strange--resurfaces, obsessed with the idea that Madeleine is destined to be his mate.
Over the next year, as the members of the triangle in this amazing, spellbinding novel graduate from college and enter the real world, events force them to reevaluate everything they learned in school. Leonard and Madeleine move to a biology Laboratory on Cape Cod, but can't escape the secret responsible for Leonard's seemingly inexhaustible energy and plunging moods. And Mitchell, traveling around the world to get Madeleine out of his mind, finds himself face-to-face with ultimate questions about the meaning of life, the existence of God, and the true nature of love.
Are the great love stories of the nineteenth century dead? Or can there be a new story, written for today and alive to the realities of feminism, sexual freedom, prenups, and divorce? With devastating wit and an abiding understanding of and affection for his characters, Jeffrey Eugenides revives the motivating energies of the Novel, while creating a story so contemporary and fresh that it reads like the intimate journal of our own lives.",Fiction,Novice,8,2,15,9.375,13,3.43,87,3.0,"BookFiendUSA: So, how was it? My GR friends' reviews are all over the place on this one. How does it compare to Virgin Suicides or Middlesex? 
 SandyBanks1971: It's...OK. Not badly written at all, but nothing incredible either. I can't compare it with Eugenides' earlier works, as I have never read anything by him before. 
 BookFiendUSA: Seriously? You've never even seen the Sofia Coppola movie? 
 SandyBanks1971: Nope. But I've read the synopses of the earlier books, and I can tell you that there are absolutely no virgins, suicides or hermaphrodites in this one. Instead, we get a manic-depressive, a wannabe Christian and an English major. 
 BookFiendUSA: No hermaphrodites? 
 SandyBanks1971: No. But there is a Marriage Plot. 
 BookFiendUSA: Explain. 
 SandyBanks1971: It's a common plot in 18th and 19th century literature. Typically, there is this girl --- the heroine --- and she has to choose between different suitors, and there will be all sorts of hijinks (pride, prejudices, misunderstandings, madwomen in the attic, etc.) before the nuptial payoff. Austen, Eliot and the Brontes used it extensively in their books. 
 BookFiendUSA: It's a romcom! 
 SandyBanks1971: Something like that. The heroine in this book, Madeline, is an English major (""English was what people who didn't know what to major in majored in."") who is steeped in these books and has to choose between Leonard, the brooding, brilliant manic depressive, and Mitchell, the earnest, spiritually inclined sensitive guy. I looked forward to how Eugenides is going to use this sort of plot in a modern setting and how he is going to resolve it. As one of Madeline's professor muses, ""What would it matter whom Emma married if she could file for separation later?"" ""How would Isabel Archer's marriage to Gilbert Osmond have been affected by the existence of a prenup? ... Where could you find the marriage plot nowadays?"" I'm also curious about whether the central romantic triangle is based on any particular 19th century novel (Franzen recently did this in Freedom). 
 BookFiendUSA: So ---? 
 SandyBanks1971: Eugenides does use the marriage plot, but the ending is a sort of a deconstruction of its traditional form. After all, in an age of gender equality and easy divorces, how could the Marriage Plot still matter? Leonard is obviously the Heathcliff type, and Mitchell is maybe a mix between Linton and St. John Rivers. Madeline is --- actually I don't quite know who she really is, especially compared to the male protagonists. Eugenides gives her a pretty extensive biography, and an intermittent ambition to go to grad school and write for literary reviews, but other than that, she seems to be merely a flimsy foil for her suitors. Early on, we are told that she loves Austen and James, but unlike Mitchell and Leonard, whose lives are transformed by the books that they read, there seems to be hardly any connection between her and those books. In a pivotal moment, she reflects on...Madeline. Yes, this Madeline, the little convent schoolgirl from Paris. 
 Leonard ruminates on Nietzche and Mitchell has his Thomas Merton inspired epiphanies, and Madeline thinks deeply about Madeline? Why can't she reflect on Wuthering Heights? Or, I dunno, Middlemarch? Or Persuasion? We never learn about what Madeline really thinks of the marriage plot --- and the obvious parallels to her private life --- either (her thesis is, after all, titled: ""I Thought You'd Never Ask: Some Thoughts on the Marriage Plot""). If The Marriage Plot is meant to be a modern reworking of an Austen or Bronte novel, this lack of development of her character is big minus. 
 BookFiendUSA: Okay, so the major female character is lame. I get it. I'd rather read a ton of Madeline books than a Henry James, though. Now, some people think that this novel is terribly pretentious, with its Ivy League setting, WASP characters and lengthy Barthes quotations. Do you agree? 
 SandyBanks1971: Not necessarily. I mean, he's writing about life in an Ivy League campus --- is there going to be an egghead or two, trust-fund babies, and academic egotists on steroid? You bet. To be fair, some of the kids are wealthy WASP types, but Leonard needs financial aid, and Mitchell is Greek and strictly middle class. There's lots of name-dropping, but in most cases, they're followed by sufficient exposition. The quotes are necessary to understand the characters' mindset, as they live in books as much as in the real world. And Eugenides is actually poking fun, wryly, at some of the faddish academic theories: 
 ""Madeline had a feeling that most semiotic theorists had been unpopular as children, often bullied or overlooked, and so had directed their lingering rage onto literature. They wanted to demote the author. They wanted a book, that hard-won, transcendent thing to be a text, contingent, indeterminate, and open for suggestions. They wanted the reader to be the main thing. Because they were readers."" 
 BookFiendUSA: Anything else that you like? 
 SandyBanks1971: I like how he writes about being in your early twenties, just out of college with your whole life stretching ahead of you. Grappling with issues, intellectual or otherwise. How everything seems to be of looming importance. How stuff happens, sometimes casually, that determine how you life the rest of your life. I think he captures that well, and can be quite eloquent about it. So I guess I'll check out the suicides and hermaphrodites.",30.0,1,5697,29168.64,5.12,427,4,2,2
1304,The Tiger’S Wife,Tea Obreht,2011,2011,"Weaving a brilliant latticework of family legend, loss, and love, Tea Obreht, the youngest of The New Yorker's twenty best American fiction writers under forty, has spun a timeless novel that will establish her as one of the most vibrant, original authors of her generation.
In a Balkan country mending from years of conflict, Natalia, a young doctor, arrives on a mission of mercy at an orphanage by the sea. By the time she and her lifelong friend Zora begin to inoculate the children there, she feels age-old superstitions and secrets gathering everywhere around her. Secrets her outwardly cheerful hosts have chosen not to tell her. Secrets involving the strange family digging for something in the surrounding vineyards. Secrets hidden in the landscape itself.
But Natalia is also confronting a private, hurtful mystery of her own: the inexplicable circumstances surrounding her beloved grandfather's recent death. After telling her grandmother that he was on his way to meet Natalia, he instead set off for a ramshackle settlement none of their family had ever heard of and died there alone. A famed physician, her grandfather must have known that he was too ill to travel. Why he left home becomes a riddle Natalia is compelled to unravel.
Grief struck and searching for clues to her grandfather's final state of mind, she turns to the stories he told her when she was a child. On their weeklytrips to the zoo he would read to her from a worn copy of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, which he carried with him everywhere; later, he told her stories of his own encounters over many years with ""the deathless man,"" a vagabond who claimed to be immortal and appeared never to age. But the most extraordinary story of all is the one her grandfather never told her, the one Natalia must discover for herself. One winter during the Second World War, his childhood village was snowbound, cut off even from the encroaching German invaders but haunted by another, fierce presence: a tiger who comes ever closer under cover of darkness. ""These stories,"" Natalia comes to understand, ""run like secret rivers through all the other stories"" of her grandfather's life. And it is ultimately within these rich, luminous narratives that she will find the answer she is looking for.",Fiction,Novice,4,6,13,9.75,9,3.37,66742,1.0,"Thank goodness for other reviewers with more patience than me - I was able to understand more about the book in an hour browsing the discussion/review pages on Goodreads than 3 weeks wrestling with the Tiger. After checking others views on the book to make sure it wasn't entirely my fault that the Tiger and I didn't bond, here's the criticisms I still maintain: 
 And using bullet points, because I love 'em: 
 - The fables: It's not that I can't do magical realism, I absolutely can. Marquez; Allende; Esquivel; Saramago; Yes please, serve me up. It's not even that 'The Deathless Man' and 'The Tiger's Wife' are empty stories - the opposite in fact. The problem is a) the stilted nature in which the fables are told b) the link between the two central fables being so precarious as to be utterly unconvincing - is it magic realism or isn't it? I don't think Obreht can decide and c) the fables are buried, to the extent that you feel as though they are being deliberately concealed from you, in a mountain of pointless (though A+) descriptions about inanimate objects (I'll get to that later, it deserves its own bullet point). 
 - Boredom: Other brave reviewers have already said it; even ones who have been so generous as to still dole out 3 and 4 stars. And that is that it all feels a bit pointless. What's the story actually about? What am I left with (apart from a headache?). If you ask me in two weeks I flat out just won't know. 
 - ""A lack of emotion"": (That's actually a quote from the The Guardian's review). Lets use some concrete examples. Natalia and Zora? Their friendship, apparently as old as they are, has about as much depth to it as puddle of water. Why wouldn't Natalia share the news of her Grandfather's death with her so-called ""best friend""? What life experiences had they been through that made them the kind of kids that get kicks out of dissecting, in fairly gruesome circumstances, pigs hearts? Not your average teenage girls, surely - but we wouldn't know because Natalia tells us nothing about what makes her tick (let alone the elusive chain-smoking Zora). And Natalia's Grandfather, arguably the most important character in the book - why are there great gaping holes in what we know about his life? We have such incredible (read ""bbbooooring"") detail surrounding Luka, his mother, his brothers, his father, his musical aspirations, his ten year sabbatical and tragic love songs that aren't even borne out of his own experiences, and for what? I think it is supposed to explain why he ultimately turned into a henous wife-beating monster. Er, sorry, no - it doesn't actually. Just as all the inane detail (pages and pages) about Darisa The Bear's childhood and how it shaped him in becoming a hunter of such great repute in later life - I still fail to see how any of this early detail was relevant to the whole of the story. Or maybe there was no point, and that is the point - ""we're just telling stories"". Oh, Ok!! But, just so you know, it's freaking boring! In my view, the balance of power in this novel is held by the wrong characters - the depth is given to stories that frankly don't deserve it, while complete superficiality (at best) is all that is afforded to the stories that actually matter. 
 - The long, long-winded descriptions: Yes, Obreht can write. If this is an exercise in cramming adjectives into sentences (or WOW words, as we call them in Year 2), yep, she succeeded. And she's 25, the youngest ever Orange Prize winner. Ok, I get it, she's talented! But what use is this without a real life actual story to tell? (see above). Primarily, Obreht's talent is directed towards describing places, objects, and events, (without emotion, as I said before) in the kind of detail only God would notice. And THAT there is probably my main criticism of the book - because remember, we're dealing with a first person narrative. I'm sorry, but a person does not walk into a room and take notice of the way a painting sits half an inch to the left on a wall covered in a fine film of whoknowswhat while some animal scratches beneath the heavy brown floor boards, the ones with the rusty nails protruding out of them threateningly. Here's an example (much better than mine, naturally). 
 ""The street below dead-ended in a flattened patch of pale grass, bordered on either side by netless goal frames. A slide and some tire swings had been set up on the lip of a wheat field that caught the afternoon light and held it in a shivering glare. Beyond that lay the graveyard, white crosses turned out toward the sea. The wind had subsided, and the road was deserted except for a single motted goat, tethered to the fence post of what looked like an enormous metal box opposite the clinic. The BEER sign braced against an oil drum under the awning was to be believed, this was the bar"". 
 Well written? Yes. Riveting? No. Even more implausibly, the vast majority of the time Natalia is recalling this detail based on what she has heard second, third, even fourth hand - or from her grandfather eons earlier. Even if I am to suppose Natalia has some super-human memory that allows her to recall all these minor threads in minute detail, I can't get past the idea that anyone walks around (doing nothing, going nowhere) ""thinking"" to themselves this way. I admit plenty of excellent books combine first person narrative with contextual descriptions of scene or atmosophere (I just finished When God Was a Rabbit - perfect example of the right balance) - but it's usually very subtle. Broken up with dialogue, events, oooh, I don't know - something actually happening once in a while. But Obreht's descriptive passages can go on for pages and pages and none of it adds anything at all to the PLOT (it's not an evil word people). It reminded me of reading a police report, or court transcript. A flowery one, to be sure, but that is the kind mundane observations and recollection of events that you're wading through. I needed more action, more convincing dialogue. Natalia was a person herself without a story, without a VOICE of her own; how ironic is that, being that it's a story about stories. And then when Natalia gets on to recounting what she's been able to glean from the memories of the villagers still living today, and also from her Grandfather based on what he told her before he died, that's when my raised eyebrow really begins to hurt. It's woolly and impossible to tether. 
 - And then there's the grating fact that it's devoid of place. The country, the city, the warring factions, all nameless. Why? Why? Why? 
 I probably didn't need to write such a long review. Goodness knows I already want the last three weeks of precious book reading time back. I could have just said ""when you have to go to Goodreads and read several other reviews to work out what the book was really saying, there's a problem"".",389.0,1,2916,2886.84,0.99,936,3,2,2
1305,The Mermaid Chair,Sue Monk Kidd,2005,2006,"An alternate cover edition exists .
Sue Monk Kidd's phenomenal debut, The Secret Life of Bees, became a runaway bestseller that is still on the New York Timesbestseller list more than two years after its paperback publication. Now, in her luminous new novel, Kidd has woven a transcendent tale that will thrill her legion of fans. Telling the story of Jessie Sullivan -- a love story between a woman and a monk, a woman and her husband, and ultimately a woman and her own soul -- Kidd charts a journey of awakening and self-discovery illuminated with a brilliance that only a writer of her ability could conjure.",Fiction,Novice,24,1,15,6.208333333333333,5,3.1,63365,2.0,"This book is so corny it will pass straight through you, undigested.",82.0,1,108,322.92,2.99,1199,1,4,1
1306,Everyone Worth Knowing,Lauren Weisberger,2005,2006,"The in-crowd wears Gucci but one girl wears her heart on her sleeve! From the bestselling author of The Devil Wears Prada comes a no-holds barred expose of the world of the Manhattan super-rich. Bette gets paid to party! Well, to plan them, anyway. And she can hardly believe her luck. Running with celebs, gaining VIP access to Manhattan's hottest spots and meeting 'everyone worth knowing' is a million miles away from her old banking job. Overnight, New York has become her sexy late-night play...",Fiction,Novice,2,10,13,11.5,11,3.39,497,1.0,"One of the worst books I've ever read. Stereotypical characters, dull plot consisted of superficial world building, with predictive and anticlimactic ending. The dialogues are unrealistic and immature. And don't even let me start on describing this pathetic excuse for a ""love story"" or spectacular failure of a love triangle. Everything is horrible about this book. 
 Girl quits banking job, because she has been unhappy, gets a job at a PR firm, finds herself to be a star of the tabloids, whining along the way, gets a crush on the guy from a security of some posh club, kisses the guy from security, everything blows up all over their heads, then the girl realizes she hates the backstabbing PR business. 
 The side characters are even more flat and unimpressive than the main character. They have even less personality than Bette, our protagonist. Yes, I'm looking at you Penelope, you were 8 years involved with the guy who'd rather spend every goddamn night of the week drinking with some unimportant acquaintances than with you. Good guys are as superficial and obnoxious as the bad guys. Uncle Will is a shameless gay stereotype and basically has no other trait than being gay. Though the author broke her spine over convincing us how Bette, our protagonist, adjusted to the world of PR, it was obvious she had no idea what the hell she was doing nor how to deal with the complications. I don't even know how she handled the Playboy party when she had been totally incompetent with the task. I admit, I read it only so I could criticize it. 
 In the end, Bette is in the same place she was at the beginning of the book. She has no prospective job, nor she knows who she wants to be in the next five years. She is shallow, self-centered and lifeless main character, who is supposedly fascinating enough for photographers to take her photos everywhere she goes, and tabloids to write bullshit about. I just don't comprehend why this girl can't speak her mind about ANYTHING OR STAND UP FOR HERSELF. But the most ridiculous part of this book was the fact that she went along with every little plan her new boss had for her - from ""dating"" a guy who's blatantly gay and whom she can't stand, to ditching her best friends and family, so she could go the parties because ""it's part of the job"". Oh, give me a break. She had no character development whatsoever, and she willingly agreed to wait three fucking months for a guy who'd go and become successful in his career, while she sits at home in her PJs and eats junk food. She doesn't respect herself and I don't see why anyone else should. 
 For a chick-lit, the romance is almost non-existent and anticlimactic. The central love story is platonic, theatrical and unrealistic to that extent that I wanted to puke. After one kiss and two 5-minute conversations, which weren't that deep, they decided they have a future together, even though there was no situation or conversation in which we'd see if they share same interests or if they're compatible together. Bette thinks Sammy is hot, Sammy thinks Bette is cute and that's their epic love.",36.0,1,4400,4356.0,0.99,1055,4,1,2
1307,Luckiest Girl Alive,Jessica Knoll,2015,2015,"HER PERFECT LIFE IS A PERFECT LIE.
As a teenager at the prestigious Bradley School, Ani FaNelli endured a shocking, public humiliation that left her desperate to reinvent herself. Now, with a glamorous job, expensive wardrobe, and handsome blue blood fiance, she's this close to living the perfect life she's worked so hard to achieve.
But Ani has a secret.
There's something else buried in her past that still haunts her, something private and painful that threatens to bubble to the surface and destroy everything.
With a singular voice and twists you won't see coming, Luckiest Girl Alive explores the unbearable pressure that so many women feel to ""have it all"" and introduces a heroine whose sharp edges and cutthroat ambition have been protecting a scandalous truth, and a heart that's bigger than it first appears.
The question remains: will breaking her silence destroy all that she has worked for--or, will it at long last, set Ani free?",Fiction,Novice,16,7,14,11.125,1,3.48,85136,2.0,"""She didn't have anything in her teeth."" 
 I took my time leaning over the table, slurped my wine from the rim to spare my white jeans. Never fuck with a rich white bitch and her white jeans. ""Not in her teeth. Up her ass, on the other hand . . ."" 
 Luke's laugh was the standing ovation. He shook his head, impressed. ""You can be pretty vicious, you know?"" 
 This book was sold with a blurb as being ""for fans of Gone Girl."" With all due respect, there is no comparison. It is more The Devil Meets Prada or Four Blondes than anything else. At best, it is the poor man's Gone Girl, a fake $5 knockoff of the original. 
 There is no arguing who is the superior writer. Flynn's words have more power. Knoll's words feel emotionless. Paraphrased. Here is a comparison of two paragraphs. 
 First, Flynn: 
 ""Men always say that as the defining compliment, don't they? She's a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she's hosting the world's biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. 
 Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they're fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men - friends, coworkers, strangers - giddy over these awful pretender women, and I'd want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who'd like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I'd want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn't really love chili dogs that much - no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They're not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they're pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. 
 Now, Knoll: 
 Pretty girls had to appear as though they weren't trying to be pretty, which I had made the fatal mistake of doing at Bradley. There were times Nell went out in her father's polo, nasty old Uggs, and sweatpants, no makeup, just to prove her loyalty resided with her own gender. Pretty girls also had to have a self-deprecating sense of humor and point out when they had a blistering pimple and talk about their explosive diarrhea to assure other girls that they weren't interested in the role of man-eating minx. 
 As you can see, there is no comparison as to whose words are far more effective. 
 This book dealt with some very difficult issues, issues like rape and eating disorders, but it didn't deal with them well. The issues were dealt with dismissively, the narrator discussed them with as much emotion as if she was telling us about her last SoulCycle class. 
 I understand that everyone deals with these issues in a different way. Some dismiss them, try not to think about them. Others dwell on their pain. A good book that deals with these issue tell the story of the character--the victim---in such a way as to make the reader empathize with what they have gone through. However the character deals with their past, be it downright ""I'm going to pretend it never happened"" to ""I can't stop thinking about it. This is killing me,"" the reader should FEEL it. 
 This did not happen in this book. You may argue that this is the main character's way of dealing with things, that I should infer it through her experience. Well, with all due respect, fuck that shit, this is a book. It is not the reader's burden to infer everything. If that's the case, you might as well hand me a blank book with two characters names typed on it and have me infer 600 pages. I don't think so. 
 As a narrator, the main character, the rather unfortunately named TifAni FaNelli, ""Ani"" (pronounced aaaaaaahh-nee), is a highly irritating one. She has one tone: glib. Again, there is zero emotion in anything she describes, from her work, to her past, to her relationships, to her descriptions of the people in her life. 
 Speaking of the people in her life, they are no better. Every single one of them is one-dimensional. Ani herself is materialistic, bitchy, constantly criticizing of others (hint: she doesn't like anyone). All the men in the book are arrogant assholes, easily manipulable if one just say the right things, offer the right promises, offer them that little bit of excitement, be the lady in the living room, the cook in the kitchen, the whore in the bedroom. All the women in the book are competitors. 
 His wife, body mean with Equinox muscles, cheery blond hair swept away from her face in a ninety-dollar blow-out. I always eye the wife first; I like to know what I'm up against. She was wearing the typical Kate uniform: white jeans, nude wedges, and a silky, sleeveless top. Hot pink, I'm sure she spent a few minutes debating it--was she tan enough, maybe the navy silky sleeveless top instead, can't go wrong with navy--and over her shoulder, a cognac Prada the exact same shade as her shoes, the perfect match more age revealing than the skin starting to pucker in her neck. She had at least ten years on me, I determined, relieved. I don't know how I'm going to live with myself when I turn thirty. 
 None of the women eat. They're all medicated up the yin-yang, spray-tanned, Botoxed Bergdorf blondes whose greatest desire in life is the ring, the husband in finance, the designer child, the summer house in Nantucket. The artificiality of it would be humorous, except that everything in this book reeks with tension-filled misery. 
 Ani's life is a giant parade in which she is the showpiece. She is clearly miserable, her life is one of an underfed bird in a gilded cage, and I have no idea why she strives so hard to maintain it. 
 Ani has as much personality as a gluten-free piece of bread. She is ""shocking"" to the upper class, and to the reader, because of her sexual proclivities. Hearing her describe her good qualities is simply pitiful. 
 I'm pretty--I have to work at it, but the raw materials are there. I'm four years Luke's junior, which isn't as good as eight, but still, something. I also like to do ""weird"" things in bed. Even though Luke and I have very different definitions of ""weird"" (him: doggy style and hair pulling, me: electric shocks to my pussy with a ball gag in my mouth to stifle my screams), by his standards, we have a freaky, fulfilling sex life 
 And it's not a pitiful as in ""poor girl, she has so much going for her, but she doesn't realize her full potential,"" as much as it is ""wow, what a sorry excuse for a human being. But really, what's between her legs is more interesting than what's in between her head, which is, frankly, nothing at all. 
 There is a severe disconnect between her and the reader. As a result, I have no empathy for her. I have no emotional connection with her. I do not feel her pain. I find her story boring. I find what happened to her---as atrocious as it was---to be little more than an afterthought. 
 The story is so, so dull. How can a revenge story hold so little interest? Well, read this book, and you will see how. The narrative is disruptive, jumping from her teens to her current ""perfect"" life, and frankly, both timelines bore the fuck out of me.",355.0,1,5670,54205.2,9.56,430,4,2,2

 At least for this review. 
 People I know, love, and respect really, really like this book. I completely get it, too. I absolutely understand how you could read this book and think it's amazing and get all caught up in the story and the characters and be transported back to that crazy time in our nation's history. 
 I just didn't connect with this book at any point, ever. I wanted to. I felt like I should have. I just didn't. I read it, never really cared, got to the end, shrugged, got off the couch, and made myself a sandwich.

 I read Helter Skelter in high school and that book was... way too long for a high school kid to read. I mean, it was a great read, fascinating, unbelievable, hard to even rationalize that it was a real event. Crazy.

 This book took real events, changed the characters names, and did nothing creative outside of that. It was fine, I guess. It's not worth whatever advance she got from Random House, and it's not worth the attention it's getting. It's not written very well, often comes across as too pretentious and trying too hard to be awesome, and ultimately forgettable. 
 Sorry... I'm trying to change.... 
 Hang on... 
 But, people like it and that's great. Sometimes books don't grab me the same way, and The Girls and I had a bad first date and still tried to make it work. It was doomed from the start, but I read it, it was short, and I can now move on to other books.

It's the early 1980s--the country is in a deep recession, and life after college is harder than ever. In the cafes on College Hill, the wised-up kids are inhaling Derrida and listening to Talking Heads. But Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English major, is writing her senior thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot, purveyors of the marriage plot that lies at the heart of the greatest English novels.
As Madeleine tries to understand why ""it became laughable to read writers like Cheever and Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about deflowering virgins in eighteenth-century France,"" real life, in the form of two very different guys, intervenes. Leonard Bankhead--charismatic loner, college Darwinist, and lost Portland boy--suddenly turns up in a semiotics seminar, and soon Madeleine finds herself in a highly charged erotic and intellectual relationship with him. At the same time, her old ""friend"" Mitchell Grammaticus--who's been reading Christian mysticism and generally acting strange--resurfaces, obsessed with the idea that Madeleine is destined to be his mate.
Over the next year, as the members of the triangle in this amazing, spellbinding novel graduate from college and enter the real world, events force them to reevaluate everything they learned in school. Leonard and Madeleine move to a biology Laboratory on Cape Cod, but can't escape the secret responsible for Leonard's seemingly inexhaustible energy and plunging moods. And Mitchell, traveling around the world to get Madeleine out of his mind, finds himself face-to-face with ultimate questions about the meaning of life, the existence of God, and the true nature of love.
Are the great love stories of the nineteenth century dead? Or can there be a new story, written for today and alive to the realities of feminism, sexual freedom, prenups, and divorce? With devastating wit and an abiding understanding of and affection for his characters, Jeffrey Eugenides revives the motivating energies of the Novel, while creating a story so contemporary and fresh that it reads like the intimate journal of our own lives.",Fiction,Novice,8,2,15,9.375,13,3.43,87,3.0,"BookFiendUSA: So, how was it? My GR friends' reviews are all over the place on this one. How does it compare to Virgin Suicides or Middlesex? 
 SandyBanks1971: It's...OK. Not badly written at all, but nothing incredible either. I can't compare it with Eugenides' earlier works, as I have never read anything by him before. 
 BookFiendUSA: Seriously? You've never even seen the Sofia Coppola movie? 
 SandyBanks1971: Nope. But I've read the synopses of the earlier books, and I can tell you that there are absolutely no virgins, suicides or hermaphrodites in this one. Instead, we get a manic-depressive, a wannabe Christian and an English major. 
 BookFiendUSA: No hermaphrodites? 
 SandyBanks1971: No. But there is a Marriage Plot. 
 BookFiendUSA: Explain. 
 SandyBanks1971: It's a common plot in 18th and 19th century literature. Typically, there is this girl --- the heroine --- and she has to choose between different suitors, and there will be all sorts of hijinks (pride, prejudices, misunderstandings, madwomen in the attic, etc.) before the nuptial payoff. Austen, Eliot and the Brontes used it extensively in their books. 
 BookFiendUSA: It's a romcom! 
 SandyBanks1971: Something like that. The heroine in this book, Madeline, is an English major (""English was what people who didn't know what to major in majored in."") who is steeped in these books and has to choose between Leonard, the brooding, brilliant manic depressive, and Mitchell, the earnest, spiritually inclined sensitive guy. I looked forward to how Eugenides is going to use this sort of plot in a modern setting and how he is going to resolve it. As one of Madeline's professor muses, ""What would it matter whom Emma married if she could file for separation later?"" ""How would Isabel Archer's marriage to Gilbert Osmond have been affected by the existence of a prenup? ... Where could you find the marriage plot nowadays?"" I'm also curious about whether the central romantic triangle is based on any particular 19th century novel (Franzen recently did this in Freedom). 
 BookFiendUSA: So ---? 
 SandyBanks1971: Eugenides does use the marriage plot, but the ending is a sort of a deconstruction of its traditional form. After all, in an age of gender equality and easy divorces, how could the Marriage Plot still matter? Leonard is obviously the Heathcliff type, and Mitchell is maybe a mix between Linton and St. John Rivers. Madeline is --- actually I don't quite know who she really is, especially compared to the male protagonists. Eugenides gives her a pretty extensive biography, and an intermittent ambition to go to grad school and write for literary reviews, but other than that, she seems to be merely a flimsy foil for her suitors. Early on, we are told that she loves Austen and James, but unlike Mitchell and Leonard, whose lives are transformed by the books that they read, there seems to be hardly any connection between her and those books. In a pivotal moment, she reflects on...Madeline. Yes, this Madeline, the little convent schoolgirl from Paris. 
 Leonard ruminates on Nietzche and Mitchell has his Thomas Merton inspired epiphanies, and Madeline thinks deeply about Madeline? Why can't she reflect on Wuthering Heights? Or, I dunno, Middlemarch? Or Persuasion? We never learn about what Madeline really thinks of the marriage plot --- and the obvious parallels to her private life --- either (her thesis is, after all, titled: ""I Thought You'd Never Ask: Some Thoughts on the Marriage Plot""). If The Marriage Plot is meant to be a modern reworking of an Austen or Bronte novel, this lack of development of her character is big minus. 
 BookFiendUSA: Okay, so the major female character is lame. I get it. I'd rather read a ton of Madeline books than a Henry James, though. Now, some people think that this novel is terribly pretentious, with its Ivy League setting, WASP characters and lengthy Barthes quotations. Do you agree? 
 SandyBanks1971: Not necessarily. I mean, he's writing about life in an Ivy League campus --- is there going to be an egghead or two, trust-fund babies, and academic egotists on steroid? You bet. To be fair, some of the kids are wealthy WASP types, but Leonard needs financial aid, and Mitchell is Greek and strictly middle class. There's lots of name-dropping, but in most cases, they're followed by sufficient exposition. The quotes are necessary to understand the characters' mindset, as they live in books as much as in the real world. And Eugenides is actually poking fun, wryly, at some of the faddish academic theories: 
 ""Madeline had a feeling that most semiotic theorists had been unpopular as children, often bullied or overlooked, and so had directed their lingering rage onto literature. They wanted to demote the author. They wanted a book, that hard-won, transcendent thing to be a text, contingent, indeterminate, and open for suggestions. They wanted the reader to be the main thing. Because they were readers."" 
 BookFiendUSA: Anything else that you like? 
 SandyBanks1971: I like how he writes about being in your early twenties, just out of college with your whole life stretching ahead of you. Grappling with issues, intellectual or otherwise. How everything seems to be of looming importance. How stuff happens, sometimes casually, that determine how you life the rest of your life. I think he captures that well, and can be quite eloquent about it. So I guess I'll check out the suicides and hermaphrodites.",30.0,1,5697,29168.64,5.12,427,4,2,2
1310,Everyone Worth Knowing,Lauren Weisberger,2005,2006,"The in-crowd wears Gucci but one girl wears her heart on her sleeve! From the bestselling author of The Devil Wears Prada comes a no-holds barred expose of the world of the Manhattan super-rich. Bette gets paid to party! Well, to plan them, anyway. And she can hardly believe her luck. Running with celebs, gaining VIP access to Manhattan's hottest spots and meeting 'everyone worth knowing' is a million miles away from her old banking job. Overnight, New York has become her sexy late-night play...",Fiction,Novice,2,10,13,11.5,11,3.39,497,1.0,"One of the worst books I've ever read. Stereotypical characters, dull plot consisted of superficial world building, with predictive and anticlimactic ending. The dialogues are unrealistic and immature. And don't even let me start on describing this pathetic excuse for a ""love story"" or spectacular failure of a love triangle. Everything is horrible about this book. 
 Girl quits banking job, because she has been unhappy, gets a job at a PR firm, finds herself to be a star of the tabloids, whining along the way, gets a crush on the guy from a security of some posh club, kisses the guy from security, everything blows up all over their heads, then the girl realizes she hates the backstabbing PR business. 
 The side characters are even more flat and unimpressive than the main character. They have even less personality than Bette, our protagonist. Yes, I'm looking at you Penelope, you were 8 years involved with the guy who'd rather spend every goddamn night of the week drinking with some unimportant acquaintances than with you. Good guys are as superficial and obnoxious as the bad guys. Uncle Will is a shameless gay stereotype and basically has no other trait than being gay. Though the author broke her spine over convincing us how Bette, our protagonist, adjusted to the world of PR, it was obvious she had no idea what the hell she was doing nor how to deal with the complications. I don't even know how she handled the Playboy party when she had been totally incompetent with the task. I admit, I read it only so I could criticize it. 
 In the end, Bette is in the same place she was at the beginning of the book. She has no prospective job, nor she knows who she wants to be in the next five years. She is shallow, self-centered and lifeless main character, who is supposedly fascinating enough for photographers to take her photos everywhere she goes, and tabloids to write bullshit about. I just don't comprehend why this girl can't speak her mind about ANYTHING OR STAND UP FOR HERSELF. But the most ridiculous part of this book was the fact that she went along with every little plan her new boss had for her - from ""dating"" a guy who's blatantly gay and whom she can't stand, to ditching her best friends and family, so she could go the parties because ""it's part of the job"". Oh, give me a break. She had no character development whatsoever, and she willingly agreed to wait three fucking months for a guy who'd go and become successful in his career, while she sits at home in her PJs and eats junk food. She doesn't respect herself and I don't see why anyone else should. 
 For a chick-lit, the romance is almost non-existent and anticlimactic. The central love story is platonic, theatrical and unrealistic to that extent that I wanted to puke. After one kiss and two 5-minute conversations, which weren't that deep, they decided they have a future together, even though there was no situation or conversation in which we'd see if they share same interests or if they're compatible together. Bette thinks Sammy is hot, Sammy thinks Bette is cute and that's their epic love.",36.0,1,4400,4356.0,0.99,1055,4,2,2

The only thing standing in his way is a gray-haired barbaric warrior, filled with rage and regret, a man who sees this battle as his last chance for redemption. But he knows his depleted forces have little chance of victory unless aid comes.

1318,A Dirty Job,Christopher Moore,2006,2006,"From the twisted imagination of Christopher Moore (The Stupidest Angel, The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove,et al.) comes a dark -- and wonderfully weird -- novel about a hapless San Francisco thrift shop owner recruited to become a soul collector for the Scythe Wielder himself, Death.
Charlie Asher is a typical Beta Male. He's not exceptionally handsome or tall or strong, and he's definitely not the heroic type. But the slightly neurotic Asher has a good life; he owns a secondhand store in San Francisco, and his wife, Rachel, is about to give birth to their first child. Then the unthinkable happens: Asher's wife dies shortly after giving birth to a baby girl. When Asher inexplicably witnesses a Merchant of Death (a seven-foot black dude named Minty Fresh, who sports a green suit and is invisible to everyone else) enter the hospital room and take his wife's soul, he too becomes involved in the soul re-acquisitioning business. Accompanied by two giant hellhounds and his trusty sword-cane, Asher's dirty job leads him to an apocalyptic confrontation with the real forces of darkness
Comparable to works from popular satirical authors like Tim Dorsey, Carl Hiaasen, Terry Pratchett, and Paul Di Filippo, Moore's blend of dark fantasy, supernatural mystery, and absurdist fiction will have readers irresistibly hooked from the first page to the last.

I'm not talking laugh out loud funny but there are moments that brought a smile to my face as I read about Savannah Slade's attempts to find out about her birth parents and deal with a motley crew of police officers, attorneys and ex-CIA agents. 
 Blood Ties is book two in ""The Searchers"" series by Ms. Sala and the action is concurrent with that of Blood Stains, book one in this series. The premise is that three sisters find out that they are not in fact blood-related upon their father's death. All three were informally adopted as toddlers when their birth mothers were in dire straits. Savannah's mother was dying of cancer and her birth father had just died in a car accident when she was taken in by her adoptive father. Now she is searching out the truth of her birth and her birth father's family is none too pleased with the prospect of sharing their wealth.

Police officer Tess Fuller has her hands full trying to maintain order in a poorly-resourced small mountain town overrun by the beautiful, arrogant and lawless Bycraft family. And nobody in town has suffered at their hands as much as the Fuller family. But what will her new sergeant, Finn Maguire, a serious by-the-books city cop, think of her renegade policing style? And will they be able to work together to save Tess' life when her feud with the Bycrafts escalates dangerously, while also trying to solve the intersecting mysteries of possible land fraud, an abandoned suitcase of money and a peeping tom with a preference for older women?",Nonfiction,Excellent,1,4,4,4.0,8,4.19,9,3.0,"This book was so frustrating for me as I kept yelling at what was going on. Little Town seems like a great place to live, if only the Bycrafts would all disappear into black hole. I can't believe how they all are so horrible and no one hasn't done something about them. You would think that being all of them are criminals they would all be in jail, instead they seemed to have the run of the town with no one to stop them. While it does seem like that is could to a stop with the new police Sargent, it will be hard going until it does. 
 The new Sargent, Finn, made me want to scream so many times. I couldn't believe how judgmental and small minded he was. I could have looked pass him doing this one time, but it was time and time again. I did love how Tess would just let him go, digging his hole deeper and deeper. I also know that Finn is hiding something. I have a couple of theories, it will be interesting to see if they pan out. 
 Tess was the highlight of the book for me. I loved how tough she was, even where there were times that she should have curled up in a ball blubbering. I found Tess's family's feud with the Bycrafts to be interesting, especially considering who she was dating. I had issues with Tess dating Jake, think she can do much better, she needs someone who will put her before their crazy family and make excuses for all the bad things they do to her.

The effortless virtuosity, directness, drama and humanity of Carol Ann Duffy's verse have made her our most admired and best-loved contemporary poet. Rapture, her seventh collection, is a book-length love-poem, and a moving act of personal testimony; but what sets these poems apart from other treatments of the subject is that Duffy refuses to simplify the contradictions of love, and read its transformations - infatuation, longing, passion, commitment, rancour, separation and grief - as simply redemptive or destructive.
Raptureis a map of real love, in all its churning complexity. Yet in showing us that a song can be made of even the most painful episodes in our lives, Duffy has accessed a new level of directness that sacrifices nothing in the way of subtlety of expression. These are poems that will find deep rhymes in the experience of most readers, and nowhere has Duffy more eloquently articulated her belief that poetry should speak for us all.""",Nonfiction,Excellent,1,10,10,10.0,9,4.07,220,5.0,:-(,0.0,0,107,1282.93,11.99,1216,1,2,5

1339,Sophie'S Choice,William Styron,1979,1998,"Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time
""[One morning] in the early spring, I woke up with the remembrance of a girl I'd once known, Sophie. It was a very vivid half-dream, half-revelation, and all of a sudden I realized that hers was a story I had to tell."" That very day, William Styron began writing the first chapter of Sophie's Choice.
First published in 1979, this complex and ambitious novel opens with Stingo, a young southerner, journeying north in 1947 to become a writer. It leads us into his intellectual and emotional entanglement with his neighbors in a Brooklyn rooming house: Nathan, a tortured, brilliant Jew, and his lover, Sophie, a beautiful Polish woman whose wrist bears the grim tattoo of a concentration camp...and whose past is strewn with death that she alone survived.
""Sophie's Choice is a passionate, courageous book...a philosophical novel on the most important subject of the twentieth century,"" said novelist and critic John Gardner in The New York Times Book Review. ""One of the reasons Styron succeeds so well in Sophie's Choice is that, like Shakespeare (I think the comparison is not too grand), Styron knows how to cut away from the darkness of his material, so that when he turns to it again it strikes with increasing force....Sophie's Choice is a thriller of the highest order, all the more thrilling for the fact that the dark, gloomy secrets we are unearthing one by one--sorting through lies and terrible misunderstandings like a hand groping for a golden nugget in a rattlesnake's nest--may be authentic secrets of history and our own human nature.""
The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer.

The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its

 This novel was chosen by members of On the Southern Literary Trail as a group read for September, 2014. 
 Sophie's Choice, First Ed., First Prtg., William Styron, Random House, New York, New York, 1979 
 The gate to Auschwitz, where those in charge choose who lives and who dies 
 Life is but a series of choices, is it not? Some easy, quickly made, given no further thought. Others are more difficult. We worry about the outcome, the consequences. After much thought, we arrive at a choice, live with it, find we worried over nothing, or become haunted by consequences we never envisioned. Call it free will. 
 When we are very young life is much simpler, is it not? Our decisions are made for us. By our parents, our caretakers. Perhaps caregivers sounds better. We do not know about the idea of free will, so we do not worry about it. We just take what comes. We are grateful if we have kind parents and caregivers. No, that's not right, we are simply happy because that is what we learn to expect. Many children learn to expect nothing good to happen. Neither the happy children or the sad children have a choice in the matter. It is simply the way it is. 
 A child who expected nothing good to happen, from the film ""Schindler's List 
 But Sophie's Choice by William Styron deals with choices made principally by his title character in a setting where the choices are given under duress, which are choices not freely made, or choices which have no satisfactory outcome, the classic Hobson's choice. Sophie is an Aryan, not Jewish. However, she is Polish. The Nazi regime despises the Poles as they did the mentally ill, physically imperfect, the gypsies, homosexuals, and dissident intellectuals. All will go to the camps. And all will only leave up through the chimneys of the crematoria. 
 Styron's method of telling Sophie's story is a master stroke of plotting. Rather than resort to the omniscient ""god"" like narrator, Styron inserts himself into the story as his younger self. ""Call me Stingo."" Echoing the words of Herman Melville,""Call me Ishmael,"" Styron relates key facts of his life as a young manuscript reader at McGraw-Hill Publishing who aspires to become a writer. Following his brief stay there, he is terminated. He must move to more affordable lodging. 
 His search lands him in a boarding house in 1947 Brooklyn, a time when trees still grew there. The older Styron writes of himself as a younger more callow figure. Stingo tells us, 
 ""To make matters worse, I was out of a job and had very little money and was self-exiled to Flatbush--like others of my countrymen, another lean and lonesome Southerner wandering amid the Kingdom of the Jews."" 
 Oh, yes. Stingo is a Southerner. A Virginian, born and bred, with a degree from Duke University. Not only is he close to impoverished and lonesome, he is lonesome for female company. Among his scant belongings is an unopened box of condoms upon which he casts a wistful look from time to time. 
 Stingo's feverish libido is fired by the nightly sounds of unbridled and enthusiastic celebrations of the ars amatoria from the room above his. It is difficult to sleep, to even think. To write is impossible. Bed springs squeak and a head board beats against a wall with a steadily increasing rhythm. There are brief interludes of silence and then the sounds of the circle of life slowly begin again rising to crescendoing heights. It drives Stingo to distraction. 
 Then we meet the unabashed coupling couple. One Nathan Landau and Miss Sophie Zawistowska. Nathan is Jewish. Sophie is not. She is a Polish Catholic who survived internment at Auschwitz. 
 Stingo walks into the boarding house to find the couple arguing. Not all is well with the two lovers upstairs. 
 At the house Sophie and Nathan were embroiled in combat just outside the door of my room... 
 ""Don't give me any of that, you hear,"" I hear him yell. ""You're a liar! You're a miserable lying cunt, do you hear me? A cunt!...[T]hat's what you are, you moron--a two-timing, double-crossing cunt! Spreading that twat of yours for a cheap, chiseling quack doctor. Oh, God!"" he howled, and his voice rose in wild uncontained rage. ""Let me out of here before I murder you--you whore! 
 Then Nathan turned his attention on Stingo. 
 ""You're from the South,"" he said.. ""Morris told me you were from the South. Said your name's Stingo. Yetta needs a Southerner in her house to fit in with all the other funnies...Too bad I won't be around for a lively conversation, but I'm getting out of here. It would have been nice to talk with you...We'd have had great fun, shootin' the shit, you and I. We could have talked about sports. I mean Southern sports. Like lynching niggers--or coons, I think you call them down there...Too bad. Old Nathan's got to hit the road. Maybe in another life, Cracker, we'll get together. So long, Cracker! See you in another life."" 
 Odd, how those who are the targets of prejudice are among the most intolerant, is it not so? 
 Stingo immediately goes to comfort Sophie. However, his feelings are conflicted. Although his choice is to comfort her, his wish is to possess her. He is captured by her beauty. And Styron will make it clear through the novel that men are frequently drawn to Sophie by her beauty. 
 One important thing that the reader must realize is that Styron is dealing with two time frames. He is dealing with the present in which he is writing the book. He is dealing with the present of 1947 in which the action actually occurs. It is through this distancing that Styron is able to set up throughout the novel moments of foreshadowing. It must never be forgotten that Old Stingo/Styron knows how this tale ends. It is a flashback within a flashback. 
 Styron gradually reveals to us that Nathan Landau is brilliant, wealthy, but mentally ill. He is capable of great charm, care, and generosity. Nathan has chosen upon meeting Sophie who is still suffering from the after effects of her internment in Auschwitz to bring her back to health and save her life. He takes her to his brother Larry who is a physician who treats her and refers her to other physicians. Upon their meeting Sophie suffers from scurvy, has endured typhus, scarlet fever, and malnutrition. She has lost her teeth. 
 Nathan has provided perfect dentures for her. Clothing. Most important to Sophie, music in the form of the latest model phonograph and records, extremely expensive in that day. And Nathan restored her eroticism to her the sense of which was totally lost to her in Auschwitz. 
 Nathan will also make the positive choice to befriend Stingo. Stingo will become part of a threesome, included in Nathan's and Sophie's adventures. Nathan will come to praise Stingo's writing giving him the confidence to complete what will become his first novel, Styron's Lie Down in Darkness. The novels most charming moments are when the three are together on one of Nathan's elaborately planned adventures. It has the sense of Truffaut's ""Jules et Jim."" 
 Old Stingo will recall, 
 ""There are friends one makes at a youthful age in whom one simply rejoices, for whom one possesses a love and loyalty mysteriously lacking in the friendships made in after-years, no matter how genuine."" 
 Oddly enough, Nathan's misgivings about Stingo were not totally inaccurate. Stingo has his share of Southern guilt with which to live. It seems that his family once had a slave named Artiste and he was put out to work. The value of that work was a large sum of money which came into his father's possession. His father sent Stingo his share of that burden of Southern history. It was that largesse that allowed him to continue to live in Brooklyn and write. The reveal of this information instantly brought a comparison of Stingo to Quentin Compson. ""I don't hate it,"" Quentin said, quickly, at once, immediately; ""I don't hate it,"" he said. ""I don't hate it he thought, panting in the cold air, the iron New England dark: I don't. I don't! I don't hate it! I don't hate it!"" Absalom, Absalom!, by William Faulkner. 
 Nathan chooses to self medicate with amphetamines and cocaine. An employee at Pfizer Laboratories, he easily obtains what he needs. The ""Bennies"" the cocaine make him fly. It is when he begins to crash that his Mr. Hyde personality appears. Sophie can only hope that barbiturates can ease him into sleep before he emotionally abuses her or physically harms her. 
 It is during those periods of time that Nathan abandons Sophie that Stingo becomes her confidant. Though she has lost her faith in the horror of Auschwitz, she treats Stingo as the priest in the confessional. Stingo is a safe confidant. John Steinbeck reminded us in East of Eden, ""Perhaps the best conversationalist in the world is the man who helps others to talk."" Stingo helped Sophie to talk. It is in Sophie's narration to Stingo that we are gradually led to Sophie's Choice. Old Stingo/Styron repeatedly reveals bits and pieces that lead us to believe that it was horrible indeed. It was. 
 In a novel as dark as this a reader is grateful for any brief respite of humor. Styron provides it here in young Stingo's pursuit of sexual satisfaction. There is the divine Leslie Lapidus who loves to talk dirty, and can talk the talk with expertise but cannot bring herself to do the deed. She envisions Stingo with his Southern accent as some Cavalier officer of the Confederate army. 
 ""I mean, I don't know much about the Civil War, but whenever I think of that time--I mean, ever since Gone With the Wind I've had these fantasies about those generals, those gorgeous young Southern generals with their tawny mustaches and beards, and hair in ringlets, on horseback. And those beautiful girls in crinoline and pantalettes. You would never know that they ever fucked, from all you're able to read."" She paused and squeezed my hand. ""I mean, doesn't it just do something to you to think of one of those ravishing girls with that crinoline all in a fabulous tangle, and one of those gorgeous young officers--I mean, both of them fucking like crazy?"" 
 ""Oh yes,"" I said with a shiver, ""oh yes, it does. It enlarges one's sense of history."" 
 Then there's Sally Ann, the Baptist, she of the stalwart hand. She leaves Stingo wrung out like a limp wash rag. Stingo complains he could have done that better himself. 
 But we must return to Nathan, Sophie, Stingo, and Auschwitz. 
 The last time Nathan broke with reality, he threatened to murder Sophie and Stingo. He believed they had made love. He was wrong about that. 
 Stingo was determined to save Sophie from Nathan. He persuaded her to go with him to a farm owned by his father in Virginia. It was on that trip Sophie revealed her choice at Auschwitz. It was on that trip that Sophie made love to Stingo. And she asked if there was a Berlitz language school near there so she might learn to write in English. 
 ""There are so many things that people still don't know about that place!"" she said fiercely. ""There are so many things I haven't even told you Stingo, and I've told you so much. You know, about how the whole place was covered with the smell of burning Jews, day and night. I've told you that. But I never even told you hardly anythng about Birkenau, when they begun to starve me to death and I go so sick I almost died...Or..."" And here she paused, gazed into space, then said, ""There are so many terrible things I could tell. But maybe I could write it as a novel, you see, if I learned to write English good, and then I could make people understood how the Nazis made you do things you never believed you could...I was so afraid! They made me afraid of everything! Why don't I tell the truth about myself? Why don't I write it down in a book that I was a terrible coward, that I was a filthy collaboratrice that I done everything that was bad just to save myself?"" She made a savage moan, so loud above the racket of the train that heads turned nearby and eyes rolled. ""Oh, Stingo, I can't stand living with these things!"" 
 Viktor E. Frankl wrote in Man's Search for Meaning ""Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'."" Perhaps Sophie lost her why at Auschwitz. 
 Birkenau: Those who do not have a why to live cannot bear any how. Is it not so? 
 Now we come to one Thomas Hobson who was an English Stable Keeper around 1600. He always required his customers to take the horse nearest the door or none at all. It came to be known as Hobson's choice, meaning what appears to be a free choice which offers no option at all. That was Sophie's choice. Was it not so? 
 Let us allow young Stingo to have the last word, shall we? 
 ""Someday I will understand Auschwitz. This was a brave statement but innocently absurd. No one will ever understand Auschwitz. What I might have set down with more accuracy would have been: Someday I will write about Sophie's life..., and thereby help demonstrate how absolute evil is never extinguished from the world. Auschwitz itself remains inexplicable. The most profound statement yet made about Auschwitz was not a statement at all, but a response. 
 The query: ""At Auschwitz, tell me, where was God?"" 
 And the answer: ""Where was man?"" 
 I have mentioned the work of Viktor Frankl. This novel stands on equal footing with Night by Elie Wiesel, The Last of the Just by Andre Schwarz-Bart, and Schindler's List byThomas Keneally. 
 William Styron won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1980. He was a finalist for the National Critics Circle Award. However, reviews were mixed. Styron was criticized for having taken on a topic to huge to be taken on in any manner other than silence, ignoring earlier works in existence and widely recognized. A narrower criticism was based on Styron having selected a Polish Catholic as his central character as the Holocaust's purpose was deemed the extermination of the Jewish Race. Styron responded in an essay in the New York Times that the Holocaust transcended anti-Semitism, that ""its ultimate depravity lay in the fact that it was anti-human,"" he wrote. ""Anti-life."" 
 All who suffered under the Third Reich suffered universally. Was it not so? 
 Other Materials 
 The Lebensborn Program Lebensborn"" translates to ""wellspring of life"" or ""fountain or life."" The Lebensborn project was one of most secret and terrifying Nazi projects. Heinrich Himmler founded the Lebensborn project on December 12, 1935, the same year the Nuremberg Laws outlawed intermarriage with Jews and others who were deemed inferior. For decades, Germany's birthrate was decreasing. Himmler's goal was to reverse the decline and increase the Germanic/Nordic population of Germany to 120 million. Himmler encouraged SS and Wermacht officers to have children with Aryan women. He believed Lebensborn children would grow up to lead a Nazi-Aryan nation. 
 The program ran from 1939-1945. Polish children were particular targets of the program with allegedly over 100,000 children stolen from their parents. 
 In an effort to save her son, Jan, Sophie begged Auschwitz Commander Rudolp Hoess to enter him into the Lebensborn Program. She doubted that he ever did anything. Hoess is the only real character to appear in the pages of Sophie's Choice. He did serve as the commandant at Auscwitz. He was a defendant at the Nuremberg Trials and sentenced to death. The author gratefully acknowledges the Jewish Virtual Library for information regarding Lebensborn and Rudoplh Hoess. This library may be located at http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/.

The Magicians",Nonfiction,Excellent,22,2,15,7.590909090909091,15,3.25,3,4.0,"review of 
 James Gunn's The Witching Hour 
 by tENTATIVELY, a cONVENIENCE - June 5, 2015 
 When I previously read Gunn's The Magicians, in my review of it ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30... ) I remarked that ""After spending something like 6 mnths reading Joseph McElroy's Women and Men I've decided to only read short bks for a looooonnnnnggggggg while - bks that I can read in a day or a few days. Every time I reach for something over 300pp long I shrink back. It's time for 'beach reading', 'vacation bks' - but when I was at the beach on 'vacation' I was reading McElroy. The Magicians fit the bill perfectly - even more perfectly than I'd hoped."" 
 NOW, I chose to read 2 Gunn bks while I was in the midst of the somewhat grueling process of spending 4 wks reviewing Source - Music of the Avant-Garde, 1966-1973 ( ""Re: Source"": https://www.goodreads.com/story/show/... ) &, once again, they fit the bill. In the case of The Witching Hour, I'll be able to write this review in no time flat thusly proving that I'm a warlock or something b/c otherwise this review will really take me an hr or 2 to write. 
 Regarding p 29 I wrote a note to myself: ""Influenced by Fort?"" about the following: 
 ""You can't just dismiss things, he thought. In any comprehensive scheme of the universe, you must include all valid phenomena. If the accepted scheme of things cannot find a place for it, then the scheme must change."" - p 29 
 Then my note for p 3 says: ""Bingo!"" so I cashed in my cards & took my money off to buy alcohol: 
 ""Matt thought about Charles Fort and his Book of the Damned, that strange and wonderful book that lists and documents the phenomena that science cannot explain in its own terms and which it therefore relegates to the inferno of the unacceptable."" - p 30 
 In the same story, b/c after all, this IS a collection of short stories (but I didn't tell you that yet), ""The Reluctant Witch"", it is written: 
 ""Between the middle of the fifteenth century and the middle of the sixteenth, one hundred thousand persons had been put to death for witchcraft. How many had come to the rack or the stake ir the drowning pool through the accusations of children? A child saw a hag at her door. The next moment she saw a hare run by and the woman had disappeared. On no more convincing evidence than that, the woman was accused of turning herself into a hare by witchcraft."" - p 32 
 That type of 'evidence' is called ""Spectral Evidence"". I'm fascinated by its history. If you go to at least one presentation in Salem, Massachusetts, to hear about the girls who caused so much suffering w/ their own spectral evidence you'll be treated to the presenter telling you it was really all the patriarchy's fault, blah, blah.. Those little girls were sociopathic brats, don't make excuses for them. I made a movie called ""Spectral Evidence"". The trailer for it is here: http://youtu.be/PFtodKMQpXE . Chances are, it won't make a lick of sense to you. It'll make about as much sense as the following quote taken out of context: 
 ""Matt looked up. He strangled, It was Abbie! Abbie's face bending over him! Matt choked and spluttered. Students turned to stare. Matt gazed around the room wildly. the girls--they all looked like Abbie!"" - p 74 
 I reckon one cd say that ""The Reluctant Witch"" is a romantic comedy. As w/ all romantic comedies, I shd be so lucky as to have a girlfriend like that. ""The beautiful brew""? It's another romantic comedy. ""Is there anyone will not desert me? Oh, Dion, old friend, why have you deserted me, too? Dion! Is your name short for ""Dionysus?"""" (p 90) I shd be so lucky as to have a girlfriend made of beer. Then we cd have sex """"Under the table?"" Jerry said with great dignity. ""Of course not. Half seas over, yes. Also: fuddled, lush, mellow, merry, plastered, primed, sozzled, squiffy, topheavy, tight, oiled, and one over the eight. I am drunk as a piper, a fiddler, a lord, an owl, David's sow, or a wheelbarrow. I feel fine."" (p 98)

1344,The Talisman,Stephen King and Peter Straub,1984,2002,"The Talisman is Sir Walter Scott's tale of the Crusades -- a tale of chivalry, of violence, of virtue, romance, and deceit. In Scott's own words: ...the warlike character of Richard I, wild and generous, a pattern of chivalry, with all its extravagant virtues, and its no less absurd errors, was opposed to that of Saladin, in which the Christian and English monarch showed all the cruelty and violence of an Eastern sultan, and Saladin, on the other hand, displayed the deep policy and prudence of a European sovereign, whilst each contended which should excel the other in the knightly qualities of bravery and generosity. This singular contrast afforded, as the author conceived, materials for a work of fiction possessing peculiar interest.",Nonfiction,Excellent,23,1,15,3.4782608695652173,11,3.85,1406,3.0,"The Talisman wins my respect for its sympathetic portrayal of a Muslim--rare for 1825--and it wins my affection not only for its memorable characterizations of Lionheart and Saladin, but also for its vivid descriptions of Crusader and Saracen dress and pageantry. The style is verbose, the dialogue is infuriating in its deliberate stiltedness (as if anyone ever talked in this pseudo-Medieval fashion!), and its plot--a far cry from the carefully structured ""Ivanhoe""--is thin and melodramatic (with one device that strongly resembles a TV episode of ""Lassie""). Nevertheless, its thoughtful themes and basic humanity redeem it in the end. 
 Both in Ivanhoe and here, Scott focuses on the real outsiders of society (the Muslim, the Jew) and compares and contrasts them with the ""inside outsider"" (the Scot, the Saxon knight, the patriotic outlaw), showing how both groups serve to enrich and broaden a hierarchical, exclusionary culture. 
 Even more interesting is the fact that these outsiders often succeed in their objectives by adopting an even lowlier disguise: the Saracen prince transforms himself first into a simple Muslim warrior and secondly into a Moorish physician in order to understand better his Crusader foes, the penitent knight turned hermit counterfeits madness in order to conceal his political machinations to win the Holy Land, and the Scottish prince--first disguised as a humble knight and then dishonored--returns to the tent of his English king in the guise of a mute Ethiopian slave, later emerging triumphant as His Majesty's anonymous champion. In a larger sense, though, all these outsiders are anonymous champions--""invisible men"" (the echo of Ralph Ellison is deliberate) exploiting their marginal status to achieve admirable goals.",50.0,1,34776,69204.24,1.99,823,5,5,3
1345,The Once And Future King,Terence Hanbury White,1958,1987,"Alt cover image for ISBN 9780441627400
Once upon a time, a boy named 'Wart' was tutored by a magician named Merlin in preparation for a future he couldn't possibly imagine. A future in which he would ally himself with the greatest knights, love a legendary queen, and unite a country dedicated to chivalrous values. A future that would see him crowned and known for all time as Arthur, King of the Britons.",Nonfiction,Excellent,8,9,16,13.625,15,4.08,7,5.0,"Where I got the book: on bookshelf. Wasabi's, to be exact. 
 This is a sad, sad, sad, sad book. And also very funny. The first book is the funniest, and then they get sadder. It's like White took the Malory Morte d'Arthur and sucked all the silly stuff out of it so what's left is the essence of the Arthur legend in all its tragedy and glory. 
 And it was written at a horribly sad time. After two World Wars, things weren't looking too bright around Europe and that outlook colors EVERYTHING that was written at the time. In fact, this reminds me strongly of C.S. Lewis, of The Lord of the Rings, of every book in which writers tried to reconcile the horror of the recent past with the hope for the future. 
 Example: 
 ""The best thing for being sad,"" replied Merlyn...""is to learn something. That is the only thing that never fails. 
 ""You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honor trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then--to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting."" 
 Arthur begins as an eager boy, and ends as an ever-hopeful but misguided ruler who refuses to see the sin that's taking place under his nose. Lancelot is forever undermined by the path down which love has taken him. Galahad's virtue is so rarified that he has to be removed from this world. Merlyn - oh, I wish we'd had more of Merlyn - is living life backward and understanding it forward, possibly the worst tragedy that can happen to any man. 
 Tragedy and hope: ladies and gentlemen, I give you the 20th century. If you want to understand it, read this. Read The Lord of the Rings. Read C.S. Lewis. Read Ray Bradbury. From our age of small wars and nameless terrors, look back and try to understand how writers used a familiar past to understand a terrifying present, and did it with a sense of humor that we just don't have.

1346,Blood Ties,Kay Hooper,2010,1999,"Set mainly in Ireland, Jennifer Lash's dark, exhilarating novel is about the redemptive power of love. It tells of Violet Farr and her loveless marriage, her wild, unfathomable son and his illegitimate son, all of them bound together in a repeating pattern of exile and homecoming, rejection and, finally, acknowledgement and love. As Elizabeth Buchan wrote in the London Times, ""Jennifer Lash is a Lawrentian in so far as she mines her material for the blood and thunder roaring between spouses, and between parents and children.""",Nonfiction,Excellent,1,4,4,4.0,8,3.74,76,3.0,"i wish this book had grabbed me more than it did. on paper, it is my kind of story: irish family, various tragedies, wild natural setting, sorrows spanning generations...that is my kind of yummy right there. and the author - underknown female novelist, mother of those fiennes brothers, artistic promise terminated by tragic illness, critical accolades, commercially forgotten...this book had promise smeared all over it. 
 and yet i thought it was only okay. 
 i think where it lost me was the writing style and the characterization. i have no problem with a densely-written story. in fact, that is my preference with sweeping family dramas. i like detail, i like thick prose. but this was just too ruminative with repetitive characterization and very little action, and the characters consistently did things that were baffling, abrupt, and had immediate life-changing consequences that seemed unrealistic, psychologically. 
 some examples: 
 for instance, i'm not sure why tug just deposited spencer the way she did, in a flurry of potty-mouthed aggression. after having cared for him so long, and after wanting spencer to be safe with relatives who were presumably better able to care for him than dolly, i don't know why she would have poisoned his entrance into his new life that way. even if violet had been a different person than she was,better able to deal emotionally with spencer's sudden arrival, it is an off-putting introduction. ""here - here's a kid - he's your problem now."" and why wasn't that letter of explanation sent before that? 
 and later, violet's coming across spencer with the dead chicken. i understand that she never wanted him there, and was maybe looking for an excuse to get rid of him, but the immediate expulsion, him still covered in the chicken's blood, still protesting his innocence...it just felt so abrupt. 
 also, spencer's coming out of his emotional shell as soon as he gets to jess' house. all the years of abuse, neglect, and upheaval seem to fall away immediately, which just doesn't ring true. 
 the story itself was good - a study of the consequences of neglect, filtering down through the generations. it begins with cecil and violet - a marriage one part convenience, one part exhausted disappointment, one part stifling homosexual urges, and they maintain a distant, baffled attachment to each other. violet spends most of her time alone, aloof, wandering the moors with her beloved dog, the only creature in the world she is able to feel any affection towards. eventually, this marriage produces a son, whom neither of its parents show any interest in whatsoever. they are fairly old when he is born, and cecil has been slipping into an addled condition that is highly routinized and solitary. violet is mostly disgusted with lumsden's existence, and resents his presence in her life, relying on a nanny to see to his development after he disappoints her by not showing early signs of exceptionality. the three of them coexist uneasily, lumsden is sent to england for school, returning for brief visits until during one of these visits, he gets caught in a compromising situation with a camera and three little first communion girls, whereupon he is shipped off to england permanently. 
 once he is there,having been invited not to return to his school, he has no prospects or skills, and becomes an opportunist, getting involved in a sort of con situation and almost inadvertently knocking up a girl named dolly, with her own checkered past of bad decisions, madness, and parental disappointment. by the time she knows she is preggers, he is long gone, and she is forced to raise their child alone, without resources or support. 
 if violet was baffled by the birth of lumsden, dolly is horrified by the presence of her son spencer. she refuses to put him up for adoption, for reasons that are muddled but seem to center on her holding on to some kind of dream she had about the one-time magic she had in the barn with lumsden - when she felt that her life still had possibilities. 
 her treatment of spencer is abysmal, criminal, horrifying. her abuse and neglect turn him into an incredibly damaged child, retreating into himself, unable to communicate except in howls and frantic masturbation. dolly's friend tug eventually takes over the care of spencer, living with dolly and witnessing her alcoholism, her parade of lovers, and her cruelty towards spencer. eventually, there is a breaking point, and tug manages to track down lumsden, who wants nothing to do with spencer or dolly, but who agrees, with malicious glee, to have the child sent to violet. 
 tug, not knowing anything about lumsden's upbringing, thinks that the irish countryside, animals, fresh air, and loving grandparents will be just the thing to wash the taint of dolly off of him. 
 it couldn't be any worse, right? 
 well. 
 it's not great. if violet couldn't cope with a ""normal"" child, she's not going to be able to cope with a terribly damaged three-year old who has just been separated not only from his poisonous mother, but also from tug, the only person who has ever shown him any kindness,and sent off to an unfamiliar and desolate palce. violet is even older now,and cecil has fallen even further down the tunnel of incompetence. it is not an ideal place for a boy to heal. 
 and that's all the plot i am going to give - i'm sorry if it sounds like i gave away too much already. but i wanted to give a sort of rough outline of the situation; how some people are just ill-equipped to be parents and their self-involvement does have consequences that persist through generations. 
 there is a lot of plot after this point, so i don't think i have given away too much, and i wish there were more reviews of this book on here to balance my own, because i think this book does have a reader, but the stifling prose and repetitive dwelling on the internal monologues of the anxious made me a little anxious myself, a little impatient to just get on with the story. 
 it's definitely not a bad book, but it was not the right book for me at this time.",35.0,1,28944,259917.12,8.98,894,5,4,2
1347,Sophie'S Choice,William Styron,1979,1998,"Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time
""[One morning] in the early spring, I woke up with the remembrance of a girl I'd once known, Sophie. It was a very vivid half-dream, half-revelation, and all of a sudden I realized that hers was a story I had to tell."" That very day, William Styron began writing the first chapter of Sophie's Choice.
First published in 1979, this complex and ambitious novel opens with Stingo, a young southerner, journeying north in 1947 to become a writer. It leads us into his intellectual and emotional entanglement with his neighbors in a Brooklyn rooming house: Nathan, a tortured, brilliant Jew, and his lover, Sophie, a beautiful Polish woman whose wrist bears the grim tattoo of a concentration camp...and whose past is strewn with death that she alone survived.
""Sophie's Choice is a passionate, courageous book...a philosophical novel on the most important subject of the twentieth century,"" said novelist and critic John Gardner in The New York Times Book Review. ""One of the reasons Styron succeeds so well in Sophie's Choice is that, like Shakespeare (I think the comparison is not too grand), Styron knows how to cut away from the darkness of his material, so that when he turns to it again it strikes with increasing force....Sophie's Choice is a thriller of the highest order, all the more thrilling for the fact that the dark, gloomy secrets we are unearthing one by one--sorting through lies and terrible misunderstandings like a hand groping for a golden nugget in a rattlesnake's nest--may be authentic secrets of history and our own human nature.""
The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its
emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-
gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.",Nonfiction,Excellent,47,1,15,6.1063829787234045,3,4.18,103,5.0,"Sophie's Choice: William Styron's Novel of Choices, Hobson's and Otherwise 
 This novel was chosen by members of On the Southern Literary Trail as a group read for September, 2014. 
 Sophie's Choice, First Ed., First Prtg., William Styron, Random House, New York, New York, 1979 
 The gate to Auschwitz, where those in charge choose who lives and who dies 
 Life is but a series of choices, is it not? Some easy, quickly made, given no further thought. Others are more difficult. We worry about the outcome, the consequences. After much thought, we arrive at a choice, live with it, find we worried over nothing, or become haunted by consequences we never envisioned. Call it free will. 
 When we are very young life is much simpler, is it not? Our decisions are made for us. By our parents, our caretakers. Perhaps caregivers sounds better. We do not know about the idea of free will, so we do not worry about it. We just take what comes. We are grateful if we have kind parents and caregivers. No, that's not right, we are simply happy because that is what we learn to expect. Many children learn to expect nothing good to happen. Neither the happy children or the sad children have a choice in the matter. It is simply the way it is. 
 A child who expected nothing good to happen, from the film ""Schindler's List 
 But Sophie's Choice by William Styron deals with choices made principally by his title character in a setting where the choices are given under duress, which are choices not freely made, or choices which have no satisfactory outcome, the classic Hobson's choice. Sophie is an Aryan, not Jewish. However, she is Polish. The Nazi regime despises the Poles as they did the mentally ill, physically imperfect, the gypsies, homosexuals, and dissident intellectuals. All will go to the camps. And all will only leave up through the chimneys of the crematoria. 
 Styron's method of telling Sophie's story is a master stroke of plotting. Rather than resort to the omniscient ""god"" like narrator, Styron inserts himself into the story as his younger self. ""Call me Stingo."" Echoing the words of Herman Melville,""Call me Ishmael,"" Styron relates key facts of his life as a young manuscript reader at McGraw-Hill Publishing who aspires to become a writer. Following his brief stay there, he is terminated. He must move to more affordable lodging. 
 His search lands him in a boarding house in 1947 Brooklyn, a time when trees still grew there. The older Styron writes of himself as a younger more callow figure. Stingo tells us, 
 ""To make matters worse, I was out of a job and had very little money and was self-exiled to Flatbush--like others of my countrymen, another lean and lonesome Southerner wandering amid the Kingdom of the Jews."" 
 Oh, yes. Stingo is a Southerner. A Virginian, born and bred, with a degree from Duke University. Not only is he close to impoverished and lonesome, he is lonesome for female company. Among his scant belongings is an unopened box of condoms upon which he casts a wistful look from time to time. 
 Stingo's feverish libido is fired by the nightly sounds of unbridled and enthusiastic celebrations of the ars amatoria from the room above his. It is difficult to sleep, to even think. To write is impossible. Bed springs squeak and a head board beats against a wall with a steadily increasing rhythm. There are brief interludes of silence and then the sounds of the circle of life slowly begin again rising to crescendoing heights. It drives Stingo to distraction. 
 Then we meet the unabashed coupling couple. One Nathan Landau and Miss Sophie Zawistowska. Nathan is Jewish. Sophie is not. She is a Polish Catholic who survived internment at Auschwitz. 
 Stingo walks into the boarding house to find the couple arguing. Not all is well with the two lovers upstairs. 
 At the house Sophie and Nathan were embroiled in combat just outside the door of my room... 
 ""Don't give me any of that, you hear,"" I hear him yell. ""You're a liar! You're a miserable lying cunt, do you hear me? A cunt!...[T]hat's what you are, you moron--a two-timing, double-crossing cunt! Spreading that twat of yours for a cheap, chiseling quack doctor. Oh, God!"" he howled, and his voice rose in wild uncontained rage. ""Let me out of here before I murder you--you whore! 
 Then Nathan turned his attention on Stingo. 
 ""You're from the South,"" he said.. ""Morris told me you were from the South. Said your name's Stingo. Yetta needs a Southerner in her house to fit in with all the other funnies...Too bad I won't be around for a lively conversation, but I'm getting out of here. It would have been nice to talk with you...We'd have had great fun, shootin' the shit, you and I. We could have talked about sports. I mean Southern sports. Like lynching niggers--or coons, I think you call them down there...Too bad. Old Nathan's got to hit the road. Maybe in another life, Cracker, we'll get together. So long, Cracker! See you in another life."" 
 Odd, how those who are the targets of prejudice are among the most intolerant, is it not so? 
 Stingo immediately goes to comfort Sophie. However, his feelings are conflicted. Although his choice is to comfort her, his wish is to possess her. He is captured by her beauty. And Styron will make it clear through the novel that men are frequently drawn to Sophie by her beauty. 
 One important thing that the reader must realize is that Styron is dealing with two time frames. He is dealing with the present in which he is writing the book. He is dealing with the present of 1947 in which the action actually occurs. It is through this distancing that Styron is able to set up throughout the novel moments of foreshadowing. It must never be forgotten that Old Stingo/Styron knows how this tale ends. It is a flashback within a flashback. 
 Styron gradually reveals to us that Nathan Landau is brilliant, wealthy, but mentally ill. He is capable of great charm, care, and generosity. Nathan has chosen upon meeting Sophie who is still suffering from the after effects of her internment in Auschwitz to bring her back to health and save her life. He takes her to his brother Larry who is a physician who treats her and refers her to other physicians. Upon their meeting Sophie suffers from scurvy, has endured typhus, scarlet fever, and malnutrition. She has lost her teeth. 
 Nathan has provided perfect dentures for her. Clothing. Most important to Sophie, music in the form of the latest model phonograph and records, extremely expensive in that day. And Nathan restored her eroticism to her the sense of which was totally lost to her in Auschwitz. 
 Nathan will also make the positive choice to befriend Stingo. Stingo will become part of a threesome, included in Nathan's and Sophie's adventures. Nathan will come to praise Stingo's writing giving him the confidence to complete what will become his first novel, Styron's Lie Down in Darkness. The novels most charming moments are when the three are together on one of Nathan's elaborately planned adventures. It has the sense of Truffaut's ""Jules et Jim."" 
 Old Stingo will recall, 
 ""There are friends one makes at a youthful age in whom one simply rejoices, for whom one possesses a love and loyalty mysteriously lacking in the friendships made in after-years, no matter how genuine."" 
 Oddly enough, Nathan's misgivings about Stingo were not totally inaccurate. Stingo has his share of Southern guilt with which to live. It seems that his family once had a slave named Artiste and he was put out to work. The value of that work was a large sum of money which came into his father's possession. His father sent Stingo his share of that burden of Southern history. It was that largesse that allowed him to continue to live in Brooklyn and write. The reveal of this information instantly brought a comparison of Stingo to Quentin Compson. ""I don't hate it,"" Quentin said, quickly, at once, immediately; ""I don't hate it,"" he said. ""I don't hate it he thought, panting in the cold air, the iron New England dark: I don't. I don't! I don't hate it! I don't hate it!"" Absalom, Absalom!, by William Faulkner. 
 Nathan chooses to self medicate with amphetamines and cocaine. An employee at Pfizer Laboratories, he easily obtains what he needs. The ""Bennies"" the cocaine make him fly. It is when he begins to crash that his Mr. Hyde personality appears. Sophie can only hope that barbiturates can ease him into sleep before he emotionally abuses her or physically harms her. 
 It is during those periods of time that Nathan abandons Sophie that Stingo becomes her confidant. Though she has lost her faith in the horror of Auschwitz, she treats Stingo as the priest in the confessional. Stingo is a safe confidant. John Steinbeck reminded us in East of Eden, ""Perhaps the best conversationalist in the world is the man who helps others to talk."" Stingo helped Sophie to talk. It is in Sophie's narration to Stingo that we are gradually led to Sophie's Choice. Old Stingo/Styron repeatedly reveals bits and pieces that lead us to believe that it was horrible indeed. It was. 
 In a novel as dark as this a reader is grateful for any brief respite of humor. Styron provides it here in young Stingo's pursuit of sexual satisfaction. There is the divine Leslie Lapidus who loves to talk dirty, and can talk the talk with expertise but cannot bring herself to do the deed. She envisions Stingo with his Southern accent as some Cavalier officer of the Confederate army. 
 ""I mean, I don't know much about the Civil War, but whenever I think of that time--I mean, ever since Gone With the Wind I've had these fantasies about those generals, those gorgeous young Southern generals with their tawny mustaches and beards, and hair in ringlets, on horseback. And those beautiful girls in crinoline and pantalettes. You would never know that they ever fucked, from all you're able to read."" She paused and squeezed my hand. ""I mean, doesn't it just do something to you to think of one of those ravishing girls with that crinoline all in a fabulous tangle, and one of those gorgeous young officers--I mean, both of them fucking like crazy?"" 
 ""Oh yes,"" I said with a shiver, ""oh yes, it does. It enlarges one's sense of history."" 
 Then there's Sally Ann, the Baptist, she of the stalwart hand. She leaves Stingo wrung out like a limp wash rag. Stingo complains he could have done that better himself. 
 But we must return to Nathan, Sophie, Stingo, and Auschwitz. 
 The last time Nathan broke with reality, he threatened to murder Sophie and Stingo. He believed they had made love. He was wrong about that. 
 Stingo was determined to save Sophie from Nathan. He persuaded her to go with him to a farm owned by his father in Virginia. It was on that trip Sophie revealed her choice at Auschwitz. It was on that trip that Sophie made love to Stingo. And she asked if there was a Berlitz language school near there so she might learn to write in English. 
 ""There are so many things that people still don't know about that place!"" she said fiercely. ""There are so many things I haven't even told you Stingo, and I've told you so much. You know, about how the whole place was covered with the smell of burning Jews, day and night. I've told you that. But I never even told you hardly anythng about Birkenau, when they begun to starve me to death and I go so sick I almost died...Or..."" And here she paused, gazed into space, then said, ""There are so many terrible things I could tell. But maybe I could write it as a novel, you see, if I learned to write English good, and then I could make people understood how the Nazis made you do things you never believed you could...I was so afraid! They made me afraid of everything! Why don't I tell the truth about myself? Why don't I write it down in a book that I was a terrible coward, that I was a filthy collaboratrice that I done everything that was bad just to save myself?"" She made a savage moan, so loud above the racket of the train that heads turned nearby and eyes rolled. ""Oh, Stingo, I can't stand living with these things!"" 
 Viktor E. Frankl wrote in Man's Search for Meaning ""Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'."" Perhaps Sophie lost her why at Auschwitz. 
 Birkenau: Those who do not have a why to live cannot bear any how. Is it not so? 
 Now we come to one Thomas Hobson who was an English Stable Keeper around 1600. He always required his customers to take the horse nearest the door or none at all. It came to be known as Hobson's choice, meaning what appears to be a free choice which offers no option at all. That was Sophie's choice. Was it not so? 
 Let us allow young Stingo to have the last word, shall we? 
 ""Someday I will understand Auschwitz. This was a brave statement but innocently absurd. No one will ever understand Auschwitz. What I might have set down with more accuracy would have been: Someday I will write about Sophie's life..., and thereby help demonstrate how absolute evil is never extinguished from the world. Auschwitz itself remains inexplicable. The most profound statement yet made about Auschwitz was not a statement at all, but a response. 
 The query: ""At Auschwitz, tell me, where was God?"" 
 And the answer: ""Where was man?"" 
 I have mentioned the work of Viktor Frankl. This novel stands on equal footing with Night by Elie Wiesel, The Last of the Just by Andre Schwarz-Bart, and Schindler's List byThomas Keneally. 
 William Styron won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1980. He was a finalist for the National Critics Circle Award. However, reviews were mixed. Styron was criticized for having taken on a topic to huge to be taken on in any manner other than silence, ignoring earlier works in existence and widely recognized. A narrower criticism was based on Styron having selected a Polish Catholic as his central character as the Holocaust's purpose was deemed the extermination of the Jewish Race. Styron responded in an essay in the New York Times that the Holocaust transcended anti-Semitism, that ""its ultimate depravity lay in the fact that it was anti-human,"" he wrote. ""Anti-life."" 
 All who suffered under the Third Reich suffered universally. Was it not so? 
 Other Materials 
 The Lebensborn Program Lebensborn"" translates to ""wellspring of life"" or ""fountain or life."" The Lebensborn project was one of most secret and terrifying Nazi projects. Heinrich Himmler founded the Lebensborn project on December 12, 1935, the same year the Nuremberg Laws outlawed intermarriage with Jews and others who were deemed inferior. For decades, Germany's birthrate was decreasing. Himmler's goal was to reverse the decline and increase the Germanic/Nordic population of Germany to 120 million. Himmler encouraged SS and Wermacht officers to have children with Aryan women. He believed Lebensborn children would grow up to lead a Nazi-Aryan nation. 
 The program ran from 1939-1945. Polish children were particular targets of the program with allegedly over 100,000 children stolen from their parents. 
 In an effort to save her son, Jan, Sophie begged Auschwitz Commander Rudolp Hoess to enter him into the Lebensborn Program. She doubted that he ever did anything. Hoess is the only real character to appear in the pages of Sophie's Choice. He did serve as the commandant at Auscwitz. He was a defendant at the Nuremberg Trials and sentenced to death. The author gratefully acknowledges the Jewish Virtual Library for information regarding Lebensborn and Rudoplh Hoess. This library may be located at http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/.

 James Gunn's The Witching Hour 
 by tENTATIVELY, a cONVENIENCE - June 5, 2015 
 When I previously read Gunn's The Magicians, in my review of it ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30... ) I remarked that ""After spending something like 6 mnths reading Joseph McElroy's Women and Men I've decided to only read short bks for a looooonnnnnggggggg while - bks that I can read in a day or a few days. Every time I reach for something over 300pp long I shrink back. It's time for 'beach reading', 'vacation bks' - but when I was at the beach on 'vacation' I was reading McElroy. The Magicians fit the bill perfectly - even more perfectly than I'd hoped."" 
 NOW, I chose to read 2 Gunn bks while I was in the midst of the somewhat grueling process of spending 4 wks reviewing Source - Music of the Avant-Garde, 1966-1973 ( ""Re: Source"": https://www.goodreads.com/story/show/... ) &, once again, they fit the bill. In the case of The Witching Hour, I'll be able to write this review in no time flat thusly proving that I'm a warlock or something b/c otherwise this review will really take me an hr or 2 to write. 
 Regarding p 29 I wrote a note to myself: ""Influenced by Fort?"" about the following: 
 ""You can't just dismiss things, he thought. In any comprehensive scheme of the universe, you must include all valid phenomena. If the accepted scheme of things cannot find a place for it, then the scheme must change."" - p 29 
 Then my note for p 3 says: ""Bingo!"" so I cashed in my cards & took my money off to buy alcohol: 
 ""Matt thought about Charles Fort and his Book of the Damned, that strange and wonderful book that lists and documents the phenomena that science cannot explain in its own terms and which it therefore relegates to the inferno of the unacceptable."" - p 30 
 In the same story, b/c after all, this IS a collection of short stories (but I didn't tell you that yet), ""The Reluctant Witch"", it is written: 
 ""Between the middle of the fifteenth century and the middle of the sixteenth, one hundred thousand persons had been put to death for witchcraft. How many had come to the rack or the stake ir the drowning pool through the accusations of children? A child saw a hag at her door. The next moment she saw a hare run by and the woman had disappeared. On no more convincing evidence than that, the woman was accused of turning herself into a hare by witchcraft."" - p 32 
 That type of 'evidence' is called ""Spectral Evidence"". I'm fascinated by its history. If you go to at least one presentation in Salem, Massachusetts, to hear about the girls who caused so much suffering w/ their own spectral evidence you'll be treated to the presenter telling you it was really all the patriarchy's fault, blah, blah.. Those little girls were sociopathic brats, don't make excuses for them. I made a movie called ""Spectral Evidence"". The trailer for it is here: http://youtu.be/PFtodKMQpXE . Chances are, it won't make a lick of sense to you. It'll make about as much sense as the following quote taken out of context: 
 ""Matt looked up. He strangled, It was Abbie! Abbie's face bending over him! Matt choked and spluttered. Students turned to stare. Matt gazed around the room wildly. the girls--they all looked like Abbie!"" - p 74 
 I reckon one cd say that ""The Reluctant Witch"" is a romantic comedy. As w/ all romantic comedies, I shd be so lucky as to have a girlfriend like that. ""The beautiful brew""? It's another romantic comedy. ""Is there anyone will not desert me? Oh, Dion, old friend, why have you deserted me, too? Dion! Is your name short for ""Dionysus?"""" (p 90) I shd be so lucky as to have a girlfriend made of beer. Then we cd have sex """"Under the table?"" Jerry said with great dignity. ""Of course not. Half seas over, yes. Also: fuddled, lush, mellow, merry, plastered, primed, sozzled, squiffy, topheavy, tight, oiled, and one over the eight. I am drunk as a piper, a fiddler, a lord, an owl, David's sow, or a wheelbarrow. I feel fine."" (p 98) 
 The last story, ""The Magicians"", was also a novel of the same name. I didn't read the story here but I did review the novel, as already stated above, here: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30... . So there.",2.0,1,36504,110607.12,3.03,789,5,4,1

This is writing that is supple and charged with intensity, language that vivifies --- electrifies --- whoever and whatever it describes.

 It's about a serial killer who targets women and torture them in a horrifying way and then finishs them!! As the investigaton goes on, all the clues seems to link this killer to Dr Catherine Cordell who was a victim of a similar attack!! 
 I loved this book and it was catchy from the first line till the last word!! It's one of the best thrillers i read this year, and this killer is really a disturbed and twisted character!!! 
 From the beginning i kept wondering what Dr Cordell have to do with all this, why she seemed to be the center of the killer's fixation and how was she linked to the other victims! 
 It was really touching to understand a little bit the trauma of agressed women, and i really enjoyed getting inside the surgeon's mind, to seee how really messed up he is, and it's frighting how totally normal he appeared to be!! 
 The characters are good and i liked Rizzolli the best, a tough woman in a man's world!! 
 As the story goes on, i found myself more interesting into the story and as the end got closer i couldn't put the book down! And the end was good, i liked how all the pieces of the puzzle fell one by one on place and how everything made a sense!

1351,Rapture,J. R. Ward,2012,2009,,Nonfiction,Excellent,1,10,10,10.0,9,2.97,20,2.0,"I tried. I really did. I tried for thirty-seven pages (the book is only 115 pages long) but I decided to throw in the kaafiyeh. I figured I'd go buy some birdseed and feed the sparrows out back or something, as sort of an expiatory gesture for having wasted as much time as I did reading this far in a clueless novel. I don't know why I picked this book up. Maybe because I believed the author would have something to say about rapture, which is an interesting psychological state. Maybe because her surname means ""kitten"" in French; I figured this would mean she would try harder to write intelligently. After thirty-seven pages, the only memorable thing was a funny quotation by Oscar Wilde she had one of her characters remember. It's a love triangle. A very boring, very pedestrian love triangle. Engaged man who owes his fiancee quite a great deal falls in love (if it is even that) with a coworker. The author tries to excuse the pedestrian nature of the writing and the pedestrian scenario by having her characters do things like make love under pink mosquito netting in an exotic location (while they're on set). This does not work. No way. They might as well be lapping up each other's concupiscent curds in the bathroom at the nearest Burger King. At least there might be some interesting graffiti to read there, as the reader's attention wanders off from the mental drivel that passes for insight and introspection in this novel. Scilicet, try these few sentences: ""He'd fallen in love with someone else and suddenly she was crucial to him. Her body was what he needed. He couldn't help it."" There are italics there but I'll spare you the unnecessary emotional straining that might cause; you might rupture something with all that sincerity and urgency. Your iris can be herniated. Did you know that? Well damn. Might happen here with all these torrid italics. I find this sort of writing literally mindnumbing. I could feel my mind falling asleep like a foot that you've curled under your ass while you're watching television, that half-assed, potato chip-eating yoga you do on the couch: ""She was aware that she was responding, in part, to the effect of touch. Touch had a particularly compelling quality when it came from a person who's been away for a long time."" This novel (or novella) is on auto-pilot. Anything is fair game to say to fill up the page. I'm surprised she didn't write, ""The sun rose, and she realized that when the sun rises it goes higher in the sky. She wondered at the oddness of that."" You know a novel's bad when you start hearing the words the characters speak in a sort of Simlish, when you start wishing this were The Sims, instead of a pretentious novel with nothing to say but BUY ME. More dumb bunnies living charmed lives in New York who don't know what to do with themselves. Even though they have money and live in New York. When did Knopf become the Dumb Bunny Ranch? Start midsentence here: ""...and under that pink mosquito net he'd felt that he'd very possibly found the woman of his life."" I think it was the fellatio scene that ruined it for me. I think that's why I stopped reading. She has this scene where she panders by putting a little sliver of male pornography in the mind of the woman giving the blowjob, because she's having trouble keeping interested as she's doing this. And that's when the lighbulb (one of the squiggly, coiled, energy-efficient type) in my brain came on. And I realized this IS ME. This is how I feel reading this book. She should have just stopped sucking. The way I just stopped reading. It's really just a Harlequin romance in Knopf's clothing. Don't be fooled by the Joan Didion blurb.

 And it was written at a horribly sad time. After two World Wars, things weren't looking too bright around Europe and that outlook colors EVERYTHING that was written at the time. In fact, this reminds me strongly of C.S. Lewis, of The Lord of the Rings, of every book in which writers tried to reconcile the horror of the recent past with the hope for the future. 
 Example: 
 ""The best thing for being sad,"" replied Merlyn...""is to learn something. That is the only thing that never fails. 
 ""You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honor trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then--to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting."" 
 Arthur begins as an eager boy, and ends as an ever-hopeful but misguided ruler who refuses to see the sin that's taking place under his nose. Lancelot is forever undermined by the path down which love has taken him. Galahad's virtue is so rarified that he has to be removed from this world. Merlyn - oh, I wish we'd had more of Merlyn - is living life backward and understanding it forward, possibly the worst tragedy that can happen to any man. 
 Tragedy and hope: ladies and gentlemen, I give you the 20th century. If you want to understand it, read this. Read The Lord of the Rings. Read C.S. Lewis. Read Ray Bradbury. From our age of small wars and nameless terrors, look back and try to understand how writers used a familiar past to understand a terrifying present, and did it with a sense of humor that we just don't have.

1353,The Talisman,Stephen King and Peter Straub,1984,2002,"The Talisman is Sir Walter Scott's tale of the Crusades -- a tale of chivalry, of violence, of virtue, romance, and deceit. In Scott's own words: ...the warlike character of Richard I, wild and generous, a pattern of chivalry, with all its extravagant virtues, and its no less absurd errors, was opposed to that of Saladin, in which the Christian and English monarch showed all the cruelty and violence of an Eastern sultan, and Saladin, on the other hand, displayed the deep policy and prudence of a European sovereign, whilst each contended which should excel the other in the knightly qualities of bravery and generosity. This singular contrast afforded, as the author conceived, materials for a work of fiction possessing peculiar interest.",Nonfiction,Excellent,23,1,15,3.4782608695652173,11,3.85,1406,3.0,"The Talisman wins my respect for its sympathetic portrayal of a Muslim--rare for 1825--and it wins my affection not only for its memorable characterizations of Lionheart and Saladin, but also for its vivid descriptions of Crusader and Saracen dress and pageantry. The style is verbose, the dialogue is infuriating in its deliberate stiltedness (as if anyone ever talked in this pseudo-Medieval fashion!), and its plot--a far cry from the carefully structured ""Ivanhoe""--is thin and melodramatic (with one device that strongly resembles a TV episode of ""Lassie""). Nevertheless, its thoughtful themes and basic humanity redeem it in the end. 
 Both in Ivanhoe and here, Scott focuses on the real outsiders of society (the Muslim, the Jew) and compares and contrasts them with the ""inside outsider"" (the Scot, the Saxon knight, the patriotic outlaw), showing how both groups serve to enrich and broaden a hierarchical, exclusionary culture. 
 Even more interesting is the fact that these outsiders often succeed in their objectives by adopting an even lowlier disguise: the Saracen prince transforms himself first into a simple Muslim warrior and secondly into a Moorish physician in order to understand better his Crusader foes, the penitent knight turned hermit counterfeits madness in order to conceal his political machinations to win the Holy Land, and the Scottish prince--first disguised as a humble knight and then dishonored--returns to the tent of his English king in the guise of a mute Ethiopian slave, later emerging triumphant as His Majesty's anonymous champion. In a larger sense, though, all these outsiders are anonymous champions--""invisible men"" (the echo of Ralph Ellison is deliberate) exploiting their marginal status to achieve admirable goals.",50.0,1,34776,69204.24,1.99,823,5,5,3

One army is led by a primeval force named Babel, whose goal is singular: to breach ""Heaven"" no matter the cost. The only thing standing in his way is a gray-haired barbaric warrior, filled with rage and regret, a man who sees this battle as his last chance for redemption. But he knows his depleted forces have little chance of victory unless aid comes. Enter Tama: A 12-year old girl on the crest of a hill overlooking the battle, who has just become humanity's only hope.

New York Times best-selling writer Matt Kindt (X-O Manowar) and artistic sensation CAFU (Rai) lead a Tolkien-esque journey into the space between life and death...through the Deadside...and into the many worlds that lie beyond right here with a spellbinding and horrific standalone volume!Collecting RAPTURE #1-4.",Nonfiction,Excellent,1,10,10,10.0,9,3.62,29,3.0,"If you've been reading comics for any reasonable length of time, then there's probably not a whole lot in ""Rapture"" that you probably haven't seen before. Floating mountains? Check. Large scale battles between opposing armies? Check. Monsters, orcs, and a bevy of other fantasy-creatures? Check. An evil villain who wants to take over the world for semi-nebulous reasons? Check. Beat for beat across ""Rapture""s four issues, writer Matt Kindt and arist Cafu seem more than content to tell us a story that continually chooses to tread familiar waters rather than venture upstream into anything new or genuinely exciting. In short: ""Rapture"" is the definition of a comic mini-series that plays things safe. 
 But you know what? That's okay. Because ""Rapture""-for all that it may lack in ambition-is still actually a pretty good time. Credit for that majorly goes to Kindt, who manages to take a story that, at least in summary, may not sound all that interesting, and injects it with just enough humor and fun character beats to make things way more entertaining than the plot probably deserves. The art's not bad, either; while I've been lukewarm on some of Cafu's work in the past-particularly when it comes to faces and eyes-here, the more fantastical nature of the story, a cadre of distinct characters, and Lord of the Rings-esque landscapes all seem to have freed him up to create something that, while never quite visually dazzling, is still leagues more interesting to look at than a lot of of what Marvel and DC are putting out right now. 
 Is ""Rapture"" one of the best miniseries that Valiant's produced? No (in fact, it's not even the best miniseries they've produced so far this year - that award still belongs to ""Stalinverse""). But is it still a breezily entertaining summer read that features a great cast of characters and a decent sense of humor?

But something has gone horribly wrong inside the Demi-Monde, and the U.S. president's daughter, Norma, has been lured into this terrifying shadow world, only to be trapped there.

So will review and tell everyone just how amazingly awesome and original that i found this book to be just as soon as i have some free time and am at an actual computer with a real keyboard and whatnot :-). i will definitely be recommending this one though, rest assured. 
 (One day later - Part Two:) 
 The Demi-Monde: Winter by Rod Rees has probably got to be one of the best books that i've received so far. 
 It contains an intriguing twist on a plethora of genres: sci-fi, fantasy, steampunk, historical, dystopia, and even a little bit of romance in there, among other good things :-). 
 A world so close to reality so as to be indistinguishable, A.I. ""dupes"" so human that a girl can fall in love. 
 I've read similar stories over the years concerning virtual realities and such, but usually they fall a bit short. The couple of big things i liked about the demi-monde is that it's so much more comprehensive, even to the point where the A.I. ""dupes"" that populate it are self-aware, can think for themselves, and think they are real. It makes for some very interesting possibilities, and quite frankly i had a very hard time putting this book down. 
 It combines major historical characters with futuristic technology and real world settings. It combines a sci-fi computer world with occult magical practices. Past vs present-future. 
 The Demi-Monde is just so rich in conflicting themes that somehow still manage to mesh together into a working piece of near literary perfection. 
 I can't wait to get the next book in the series and find out what happens to Ella, Vanka, Norma, Trixie, Dashwood, and all of them. WHat with the whole relationship thing developing, dormant singularities awakening, messiahs manifesting, and quasi-magical/cyber rites of transference throwing wrenches into gears. 
 Needless to say i highly recommend this book. Particularly so if you're a bit bored with reading the same old stuff you've been reading forever and want to try hooking into something new and different :-)",0.0,0,2889,10082.61,3.49,961,3,2,5

I haven't read much urban fantasy and when it comes to fantasy, I don't have much experience with fay folklore. It didn't seem to matter much that I had little experience with either of these as the main focus of the story was on the arrival of Aine, who she was and what her arrival meant to the Manhattan Exiles. 
 The best part of the novel was that the author didn't feel the need to share every bit of fay history. As the story moved along, bits and pieces of why the fay were stuck in our world were revealed when it was relevant to the plot. It wasn't done with long winded explanations either. It was usually an off-handed comment which revealed that the exile wasn't something that just happened yesterday and showed how characters really felt about each other. 
 While this approach worked for the overall history of this group of exiles, I did struggle that more of Winter, the main protagonist of the story, was not shared. I struggled to understand why he was in D.C. when his family was in Manhattan. What exactly did his fancy earbobs do? Why did he hate himself so much? Why are Gabby, Lolo and Richard even friends with him? There was a lot of backstory there that I felt I was missing to truly connect with the character. 
 It was the greater mystery that kept me reading Winter. The girl that emerged from the wall, Aine, shared my confusion regarding Winter and his crazy family (both his biological and adoptive families). While at first she seemed weak and whiny, as the story moved on, she became one of the strongest, most caring female characters in the book. Once she got her footing, she was determined to achieve her goal. 
 This novel would be for readers who don't like a spoon-fed plot. Remy deftly hands out pieces of the Exiles history and only begins to reveal the psychology behind the actions of her troubled characters. This is a complex story where, at the end, not all is known and some readers might find that frustrating. For me, it was refreshing. I don't mind open-ended plots when the story is well-written. Winter left me wondering if the characters will be able to overcome themselves as that seems to be their greatest obstacle. It made this urban fantasy seem real and alive.

 With Wes's story we come to the end of the Tall Dark and Dangerous series and I have to say I was more than a little sad. I've had such a good time with this series (and all its hunky SEAL's) and can't say enough good things about it. 
 I'm always guaranteed a good time here, with clever writing, action packed storylines, to-die-for heroes and strong women that bring them to their knees. Brockmann's dialogue is always good too; sigh-worthy, realistic and often very funny. All the books are loosely connected (following Seal Team 10's Alpha squad) yet each still different enough that it feels fresh and unique and could easily be read as stand-alone. Of course then theres the romance and Brockmann will get you every time especially when her tough guys cry, and they almost always do. 
 My only complaint with this would be that because it's the last in the series I wanted to have a more final epilogue. One that included all the guys together and some reflection (like say a wedding) giving me a sort of closure. As it was she even introduced new characters and then it just well...ended like all the other books. HEA-see ya later. I was like now what? What's going to happen to SEAL team 10? -Sigh, I need to get a life. 
 Wes Skelly is on leave in LA. He's also in love with a married woman so he doesn't expect much to come of the blind date he's just been set up on by Melody and Cowboy Jones (Everyday, Average Jones) Brittany Evans isn't really keen on this date either and sets the rules quickly (not gunna happen), which surprisingly results in the two of them becoming friends without having to worry about the romance end of it. Britt is different then any woman Wes has ever met and for some reason he finds himself opening up to her and relaxing. She's a single mother to an adopted son, a good listener, tons of fun and the perfect nurturer for a man with serious issues (god I love the tortured heroes.) 
 Yeah Wes has some problems; he ""might"" be an alcoholic, craves a cigarette every couple of pages has issues with his father, never got over the death of his brother, is in love with a colleagues wife and top it off is vertically challenged, being the only SEAL not topping 6feet. Still with all the baggage Wes is a very likable guy. I loved watching him open up and realize that he was worth much more then unrequited love. The inner dialogue is again very good as are the love scenes and I enjoyed the fact that these two became friends before the lust hit. With a cute sub plot involving a spoiled TV starlet, a crazed stalker and a surprising death, this had just about everything I could ask for until I realized it was the last one.

1366,Winter,Len Deighton,1988,2016,"A November morning in the 1920s finds an elderly man in his eighties walking the grounds of his Dorchester home, pondering his past and future with deep despondence. That man is the revered novelist and poet Thomas Hardy, and Christopher Nicholson's fictionalized account of the final years of the accomplished writer's life is as engrossing as it is heartbreaking.
The novel focuses on the true events that occurred around the London theater dramatization of Hardy's acclaimed novel Tess of the D'Urbervilles, including Hardy's hand-picked casting of the young, alluring Gertrude ""Gertie"" Bugler of The Hardy Players to play Tess. As plans for the play become more concrete, Hardy's interest in Gertie becomes a voyeuristic infatuation, causing him to write some of the best poems of his career. However, when Hardy's reclusive wife, Florence, catches wind of Hardy's desire for Gertie to take the London stage, a tangled web of jealously and missed opportunity ensnares all three characters-with devastating results.
Told from the perspectives of Hardy, Gertie, and Florence, Nicholson's novel perfectly captures the often-difficult juxtaposition of fledgling hopes and the unfulfilled life.

1368,Winter,Len Deighton,1988,2016,"A November morning in the 1920s finds an elderly man in his eighties walking the grounds of his Dorchester home, pondering his past and future with deep despondence. That man is the revered novelist and poet Thomas Hardy, and Christopher Nicholson's fictionalized account of the final years of the accomplished writer's life is as engrossing as it is heartbreaking.
The novel focuses on the true events that occurred around the London theater dramatization of Hardy's acclaimed novel Tess of the D'Urbervilles, including Hardy's hand-picked casting of the young, alluring Gertrude ""Gertie"" Bugler of The Hardy Players to play Tess. As plans for the play become more concrete, Hardy's interest in Gertie becomes a voyeuristic infatuation, causing him to write some of the best poems of his career. However, when Hardy's reclusive wife, Florence, catches wind of Hardy's desire for Gertie to take the London stage, a tangled web of jealously and missed opportunity ensnares all three characters-with devastating results.
Told from the perspectives of Hardy, Gertie, and Florence, Nicholson's novel perfectly captures the often-difficult juxtaposition of fledgling hopes and the unfulfilled life. With expert insight into the struggles of both Hardy and Florence, coupled with poetic yet unassuming prose, Winteris certainly on par with the novels of its central character.",Nonfiction,Famous,11,8,16,11.727272727272728,10,3.72,23,3.0,"This is an historical novel about Thomas Hardy, the famous author.

The others in this collection go from the ridiculous (The Langoliers) to the disappointing (Secret Window, Secret Garden) and inconsequential (The Sun Dog). The problem with the Langoliers was -- as death approached -- a group responsible for saving everyone became distracted by some very silly things, thereby shattering the believability factor. Immersion GONE. The Langoliers was also too long by about half. The disappointment I had in Secret Window, Secret Garden was due to the story not living up to the movie adaptation featuring Johnny Depp. Usually stories are so much better than the movie version, but not here. Here in the story we have happenstance saving the life of a certain someone rather than an ending that gave me chills as what I got with the movie. I won't even get started on The Sun Dog.

 Chris Van Allsburg's The Polar Express is a children's classic. This story about a little boy who boards a train to the North Pole and gets the first Christmas gift of the year is a timeless reminder of the joys of Christmas and why it's great for kids to believe. 
 This book is a classic. I can remember reading this as a kid, and more recently seeing the movie. I wasn't a huge fan of this book like other kids were, I enjoyed it but it wasn't a favourite. Reading it again now I can really enjoy the art, which I didn't even pay attention to as a kid. The art and the story of this book are pretty fantastic. I did find the story a little dull and rushed at times which is why it doesn't get a perfect score. 
 The art of this book is really the high point. The illustrations are beautiful and really capture the magic of Christmas. The really iconic and classic image of this book is the final page, the bell, which is really a striking image and one I've always remembered. 
 The story itself is really beautiful. I always felt that it was important for kids to believe is Christmas, it inspires so much imagination. I think this story is a huge reminder of that. I do think it's a bit rushed, it is a really short book, but it's understandable given that it is a picture book. This is definitely a picture book that could have been expanded though and wouldn't suffer from the expansion.

Trying to hold on to the evaporating past, she begins to write all that she can remember of her life as a girl in China. Meanwhile, her daughter Ruth, a ghostwriter for authors of self-help books, is losing the ability to speak up for herself in front of the man she lives with and his two teenage daughters. None of her professional sound bites and pat homilies works for her personal life; she knows only how to translate what others want to say.
Ruth starts suspecting that something is terribly wrong with her mother. As a child, Ruth had been constantly subjected to her mother's disturbing notions about curses and ghosts, and to her repeated threats to kill herself, and was even forced by her mother to try to communicate with ghosts. But now LuLing seems less argumentative, even happy, far from her usual disagreeable and dissatisfied self.
While tending to her ailing mother, Ruth discovers the pages LuLing wrote in Chinese, the story of her tumultuous and star-crossed life, and is transported to a backwoods village known as Immortal Heart. There she learns of secrets passed along by a mute nursemaid, Precious Auntie; of a cave where dragon bones are mined, some of which may prove to be the teeth of Peking Man; of the crumbling ravine known as the End of the World, where Precious Auntie's scattered bones lie, and of the curse that LuLing believes she released through betrayal.
Like layers of sediment being removed, each page reveals secrets of a larger mystery: What became of Peking Man? What was the name of the Bonesetter's Daughter? And who was Precious Auntie, whose suicide changed the path of LuLing's life? Within LuLing's calligraphed pages awaits the truth about a mother's heart, what she cannot tell her daughter yet hopes she will never forget.
Set in contemporary San Francisco and in a Chinese village where Peking Man is being unearthed, The Bonesetter's Daughter is an excavation of the human spirit: the past, its deepest wounds, its most profound hopes. The story conjures the pain of broken dreams, the power of myths, and the strength of love that enables us to recover in memory what we have lost in grief.

Inheritanceis a gracefully wrought novel centering on the emotional awakening of Sonil, a fifteen-year-old girl living with her aunts in India. Overcome by a lingering illness, she travels to the mythic island of Pi to recover under the care of her beloved grandmother. In this lush Arcadian space, boundaries between what is real and what is not diminish, and Sonil begins to discover who she is.

1388,The Woman In Cabin 10,Ruth Ware,2016,2016,"In this tightly wound story, Lo Blacklock, a journalist who writes for a travel magazine, has just been given the assignment of a lifetime: a week on a luxury cruise with only a handful of cabins. At first, Lo's stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for--and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo's desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong...
With surprising twists and a setting that proves as uncomfortably claustrophobic as it is eerily beautiful, Ruth Ware offers up another intense read.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,19,4,16,7.263157894736842,9,3.66,111301,4.0,"In this book we follow Lo as she is sent on a new maiden voyage for her travel journalism job. However once aboard she witnesses what she thinks is a murder. Is she telling the truth or is she just traumatised after the break in that occurred at her house just a few days before? 
 This felt to me a little like Murder on the orient express meets Titanic, there was a limited number of people who could be the possible murderer and the fact that there was a limited amount of time to solve the mystery as the ship would dock and therefore all evidence and more importantly the passengers would be gone. 
 The book was pretty fast paced, like I said I'm not usually one for crime thrillers however it was fun to read about the story from a normal person, not a cop and not someone who has access to every part of the ship to go searching for clues. Lo is a journalist so of course she knows how to get information out of people but she does it in a normal way, she doubts herself and turns to alcohol in order to get over the shock - just like any normal person would. The character isn't bigged up in any way, she is normal and has issues just like anyone else - this makes the story seem a bit more realistic as Lo could be any one of us. 
 In terms of the story there are some red herrings and I personally didn't guess what was going on at all, there were some moments where I thought Lo was being a bit stupid (e.g. leaving the only piece of evidence in her room instead of keeping it on her) but overall I think the reveal did come as a shock. I do think the ending did become a little outrageous and for that the story isn't 5/5, I just think everything seemed a little too rushed and all the story was summed up in about 20 pages with all the important information being stuffed into the final pages. Therefore I'd have liked if the story had wrapped up a little smoother and the characters didn't become so...I don't know sort of fake, they no longer seemed like people, they were just book characters who were doing stupid and outrageous acts instead of characters who I actually believed could be real (which for me is the sign of a good book). 
 Overall this was an ok thriller, it was fast paced which I liked, the characters were mostly believable until the end and I liked that I didn't guess the ending and the story did make you doubt yourself and Lo all the way through. I would recommend it for those of who like a good thriller however if you are looking for a really great thriller then maybe give this one a miss. For me it was good but not great, however I didn't dislike it so for that reason I'm giving it a 4.

Because Troy Phelan's new will names a sole surprise heir to his eleven-billion-dollar fortune: a mysterious woman named Rachel Lane, a missionary living deep in the jungles of Brazil.
Enter the lawyers. Nate O'Riley is fresh out of rehab, a disgraced corporate attorney handpicked for his last job: to find Rachel Lane at any cost. As Phelan's family circles like vultures in D.C., Nate is crashing through the Brazilian jungle, entering a world where money means nothing, where death is just one misstep away, and where a woman - pursued by enemies and friends alike - holds a stunning surprise of her own.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,30,1,14,6.033333333333333,9,3.83,81270,3.0,"The Testament contrasts the heirs of a very rich man who decides that he wants to leave all his money to someone who doesn't want it. 
 Troy Phelan, a 78-year-old fabulously wealthy eccentric is sick of living and tired of his money-grubbing relatives who can't wait for him to die so they can partake of his billions. Their grasping has already spawned a legion of lawyers. Phelan has developed a plan to exclude all of them from his will. First he invites a battery of psychiatrists, hired by the family to certify that he is of sound mind -- essential for the family since they assume the extent will will be the one in force at the time of his death -- and after their seal of approval has been dutifully taped and witnessed, he reveals a holographic will to his personal attorney that pays only the debts of family members incurred as of the date of his death. He then walks over to the window of his immense office building and jumps out the window. A clause in his last testament prohibits his attorney from revealing the contents of the will before thirty days are up and all the remaining money, in the billions he leaves to an illegitimate child, Rachel Lane, no one has known of who, for the past eleven years, has been a missionary in the Brazil jungles. 
 The reading of the will tears everything loose. Lawyers begin to belly up to the trough, knowing that whatever the outcome of the will's inevitable challenge -- even though the will had specifically completely disinherited anyone in the family who challenged its provisions -- they will benefit handsomely. The first item of business was to hire a PR firm to present the children as loving heirs cut out of their rightful inheritance by a demented man. As one lawyer (Grisham must really hate lawyers and PR people, they come across as such miserable people) noted, PR firms, i.e. professional liars don't come cheap -- he was charging $600 per hour and $400 per hour for his ""useless"" accompanying staff. 
 They also hired a new batch of psychiatrists -- after having fired the first group, they had to get some who could now overrule the original finding of sanity. They found one quickly in the classified section of a magazine for trial lawyers.

1398,Ender'S Shadow,Orson Scott Card,1999,1999,"Ender's Shadowis being dubbed as a parallel novel to Orson Scott Card's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Ender's Game. By ""parallel,"" Card means that Shadowbegins and ends at roughly the same time as Game, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity's fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of Shadow, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know.
Although it may seem like Shadowis merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous Ender's Game, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of Ender's Gamehinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, Shadowmanages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that Shadow, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. --Craig E.
