Dennis knows that Arnie's never had much luck in the looks or popularity department, or really taken an interest in owning a car . . . but Christine quickly changes all that. Arnie suddenly has the newfound confidence to stick up for himself, going as far as dating the most beautiful girl at Libertyville High--transfer student Leigh Cabot--even as a mysteriously restored Christine systematically and terrifyingly consumes every aspect of Arnie's life. Dennis and Leigh soon realize that they must uncover the awful truth behind a car with a horrifying and murderous history.

1402,The Blind Assassin,Margaret Atwood,2000,2001,"Margaret Atwood takes the art of storytelling to new heights in a dazzling novel that unfolds layer by astonishing layer and concludes in a brilliant and wonderfully satisfying twist. Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and cliches of the 1930s and 1940s, The Blind Assassin is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience.
It opens with these simple, resonant words: ""Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge."" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a- novel. Entitled The Blind Assassin, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.
For the past twenty-five years, Margaret Atwood has written works of striking originality and imagination. In The Blind Assassin, she stretches the limits of her accomplishments as never before, creating a novel that is entertaining and profoundly serious. The Blind Assassin proves once again that Atwood is one of the most talented, daring, and exciting writers of our time. Like The Handmaid's Tale, it is destined to become a classic.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,7,6,14,8.857142857142858,15,3.95,100153,0.0,Recommended by my best friend,0.0,0,236,1885.64,7.99,378,1,2,3

In the heat of a hospital laundry room in New Jersey, a woman does her lover's washing and thinks about his wife. In Boston, a man buys his love child, his only son, a first baseball bat and glove. At the heart of these stories is the irrepressible, irresistible Yunior, a young hardhead whose longing for love is equaled only by his recklessness--and by the extraordinary women he loves and loses: artistic Alma; the aging Miss Lora; Magdalena, who thinks all Dominican men are cheaters; and the love of his life, whose heartbreak ultimately becomes his own.

 I received this book to give an honest review. 
 As anyone who knows my genre of reading knows that I am not big on Sci-fi books. I guess for me sometimes they feel too Sci-fiish (not sure that is even a real word.) Though on this book I was worried that I wouldn't like it but I was wrong. It was actually a bit enjoyable, though hold up a minute don't think that I am fully on the Sci-Fi train just this book was a good one for me. 
 We are introduced to Brielle who I am assuming is a human and works hard for what she has which isn't much but it is hers. I love the fact that she is a bounty hunter to me that is so cool and amazing though we don't read about her capturing anyone we get the feeling she is good at what she does. 
 When she gets laid off because of something silly she decides to find this major treasure only thing is another bounty hunter Finn is set on getting it first. Finn is an alien but you can tel with the way he jokes around with Brielle he has feelings for her. 
 When the two are stuck in a ship things get hot and heavy and then we learn just a bit about the Tulan and what happens within that species. I can honestly say I wasn't expecting that part it was a nice little twist. 
 When Brielle goes to not only work with her friend on a site across the system she also is there to warn them of the impending battle that may approach will Finn find her in time to save them all? Or will he be too late? Will Brielle give in to her feelings and needs to Finn or still be stubborn? 
 I really liked how Finn for an alien was a sweetheart and no matter what Brielle did or said did not deter him away.

Thanks to the financial security and material comforts provided by their father's prosperous rickshaw business, twenty-one-year-old Pearl Chin and her younger sister, May, are having the time of their lives. Though both sisters wave off authority and tradition, they couldn't be more different: Pearl is a Dragon sign, strong and stubborn, while May is a true Sheep, adorable and placid. Both are beautiful, modern, and carefree . . . until the day their father tells them that he has gambled away their wealth and that in order to repay his debts he must sell the girls as wives to suitors who have traveled from California to find Chinese brides.

In Los Angeles they begin a fresh chapter, trying to find love with the strangers they have married, brushing against the seduction of Hollywood, and striving to embrace American life even as they fight against discrimination, brave Communist witch hunts, and find themselves hemmed in by Chinatown's old ways and rules.

God is dead. Meet the kids.When Fat Charlie's dad named something, it stuck. Like calling Fat Charlie ""Fat Charlie."" Even now, twenty years later, Charlie Nancy can't shake that name, one of the many embarrassing ""gifts"" his father bestowed -- before he dropped dead on a karaoke stage and ruined Fat Charlie's life.
Mr. Nancy left Fat Charlie things. Things like the tall, good-looking stranger who appears on Charlie's doorstep, who appears to be the brother he never knew. A brother as different from Charlie as night is from day, a brother who's going to show Charlie how to lighten up and have a little fun ... just like Dear Old Dad. And all of a sudden, life starts getting very interesting for Fat Charlie.
Because, you see, Charlie's dad wasn't just any dad. He was Anansi, a trickster god, the spider-god. Anansi is the spirit of rebellion, able to overturn the social order, create wealth out of thin air, and baffle the devil. Some said he could cheat even Death himself.
Returning to the territory he so brilliantly explored in his masterful New York Timesbestseller, American Gods, the incomparable Neil Gaimanoffers up a work of dazzling ingenuity, a kaleidoscopic journey deep into myth that is at once startling, terrifying, exhilarating, and fiercely funny -- a true wonder of a novel that confirms Stephen King's glowing assessment of the author as ""a treasure-house of story, and we are lucky to have him.""",Nonfiction,Intermediate,3,1,13,7.333333333333333,2,4.01,32,3.0,"On seeing Anansi Boys on the library's audiobook shelf, I recalled reading and being reasonably pleased with the author's previous work, so it entered my queue. I found a tale that has in common with #1 in the series the notion of quasi-deities moving anonymously through our banal modern-day world. What's different -- I think -- is that this one is funny. On the other hand, another variable is that the previous book was in print format and this one was performed by a very good voice actor. So maybe he popped out humor that might otherwise have had less effect. 
 After a while, the humor does become rather predictable. Maybe that's an indication the book is a bit longer than it ought to be. Personally, I thought the interplay among the main characters was delicious, but yawned through their sorties into the spirit world. 
 But the final analysis is that it's satisfying. The bad guy is a caricature of the lousy boss each of us has had at one point or another, and there's pleasure in seeing what happens to him. The mother-in-law-to-be is likewise overdrawn, but in the end not evil. (One of my favorite lines occurs when, to everyone's surprise, the tough old biddy is languishing in the hospital: ""I thought, if there was a nuclear war, at the end there would still be radioactive cockroaches, and your Mum."")

 Read my Review Here! 
 Let me start off by stating that I was really intrigued from the start. You are immediately immersed in a new dystopian world of few words. That concept clicked with me immediately. I loved the idea of possibilities around it. However, based on how many stars I had given this book, I wasn't overall completely impressed with the direction of this book. 
 The List dealt with many subjects of controversy; religion, art, power, and of course, language. However, I felt as if they could've been handled better than they had been. 
 One thing I must say is that I was surprised by the diction that the author had chosen. I expected it the writing to be a little bit more advanced, then again this is directed towards middle graders. With that it mind, I think the world limit of 500 was genius yet hurtful to the story. How could you limit yourself to 500 different words? But, with the limit, the concept strengthened the idea of how small the character's vocabulary was. 
 Though this book was set in another world, we didn't get to experience that much of it. Or see the differences between our world from theirs. The book implies that you should already know everything about this world before even reading the first page. I mean, with only 500 words to work with you'd think it would be easy to understand. However, I found myself rereading sections, confused as to what in the world was going on. 
 Speaking of characters, some of the interactions felt awkward and confusing, as if the author was forcing the conversations to go one way but the characters wanted it to go another. 
 Overall, The List is a little cliche. Though I probably won't read it again, I do recommend giving The List a go.",0.0,0,2916,8718.84,2.99,943,3,2,2

The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of Shadow, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know.
Although it may seem like Shadowis merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous Ender's Game, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of Ender's Gamehinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, Shadowmanages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that Shadow, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. --Craig E. Engler",Nonfiction,Intermediate,1,15,15,15.0,2,4.3,1211,4.0,"If you liked Ender's Game, this book complements that story as we follow Bean, learning of his origins before Battle School and getting a taste of the inner workings of his mind. While there is some overlap of the storyline between the two novels, it doesn't feel like all that much material is repeated. The novel also benefits from a much more fleshed out world than of that depicted in Ender's Game (no surprise, of course, but nice none the less). Recommended.",0.0,0,416,411.84,0.99,250,3,1,4
1442,The Blind Assassin,Margaret Atwood,2000,2001,"Margaret Atwood takes the art of storytelling to new heights in a dazzling novel that unfolds layer by astonishing layer and concludes in a brilliant and wonderfully satisfying twist. Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and cliches of the 1930s and 1940s, The Blind Assassin is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience.
It opens with these simple, resonant words: ""Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge."" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a- novel. Entitled The Blind Assassin, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.
For the past twenty-five years, Margaret Atwood has written works of striking originality and imagination. In The Blind Assassin, she stretches the limits of her accomplishments as never before, creating a novel that is entertaining and profoundly serious. The Blind Assassin proves once again that Atwood is one of the most talented, daring, and exciting writers of our time.

Even now, twenty years later, Charlie Nancy can't shake that name, one of the many embarrassing ""gifts"" his father bestowed -- before he dropped dead on a karaoke stage and ruined Fat Charlie's life.
Mr. Nancy left Fat Charlie things. Things like the tall, good-looking stranger who appears on Charlie's doorstep, who appears to be the brother he never knew. A brother as different from Charlie as night is from day, a brother who's going to show Charlie how to lighten up and have a little fun ... just like Dear Old Dad. And all of a sudden, life starts getting very interesting for Fat Charlie.
Because, you see, Charlie's dad wasn't just any dad. He was Anansi, a trickster god, the spider-god. Anansi is the spirit of rebellion, able to overturn the social order, create wealth out of thin air, and baffle the devil. Some said he could cheat even Death himself.
Returning to the territory he so brilliantly explored in his masterful New York Timesbestseller, American Gods, the incomparable Neil Gaiman offers up a work of dazzling ingenuity, a kaleidoscopic journey deep into myth that is at once startling, terrifying, exhilarating, and fiercely funny -- a true wonder of a novel that confirms Stephen King's glowing assessment of the author as ""a treasure-house of story, and we are lucky to have him.""",Nonfiction,Intermediate,3,1,13,7.333333333333333,2,4.01,4395,4.0,I devoured this book.

Trisha's mom is recently divorced, and her brother is feuding with her for moving from Boston to small-town Maine, where classmates razz him. Trisha steps off the trail for a pee and a respite from the bickering. And gets lost.Trisha's odyssey succeeds on several levels. King renders her consciousness of increasing peril beautifully, from the ""first minnowy flutter of disquiet"" in her guts to her into-the-wild tumbles to her descent into hallucinations, the nicest being her beloved Red Sox baseball pitcher Tom Gordon, whose exploits she listens to on her Walkman. The nature writing is accurate, tense, and sometimes lyrical, from the maddening whine of the no-see-um mosquito to the profound obbligato of the ""Subaudible"" (Trisha's dad's term for nature's intimations of God). Our identification with Trisha deepens as we learn about her loved ones: Dad, a dreamboat whose beer habit could sink him; loving but stubborn Mom; Trisha's best pal, Pepsi Robichaud, vividly evoked by her colorful sayings (""Don't go all GIRLY on me, McFarland!""). The personal associations triggered by a full moon, the running monologue with which she stays sane--we who have been lost in woods will recognize these things.
In King's revealing Amazon.com interview, he said the one book he wishes he'd written was Lord of the Flies.

Taking the job means accepting a painful pay cut, giving up perks like free Louboutins, and moving back in with her parents, but Adrienne is certain that her new position will be the making of her career.

Jacob Hunt is a teen with Asperger's syndrome. He's hopeless at reading social cues or expressing himself well to others, though he is brilliant in many ways.

I see in the reviews that people are complaining about her using the same devices over and over again, but since this is my first exposure, I didn't see any of that and it didn't bother me. 
 I really enjoyed this, 3 stars aside; again, why can't we have half stars? I found the multiple perspectives to be very interesting, and each voice was very distinctly different, although I could have done without the different fonts in each chapter; that just made my eyes hurt. I didn't really mind the present tense writing, since it made the whole thing seem more urgent and immediate, although that's normally a major pet peeve of mine. 
 I was really impressed with her research, and also the deep, raw emotion she conveyed through the different voices. I have been a caregiver and a child of a caregiver, so I identified deeply with Emma and Theo. I have worked with people in the situation of Jacob, so I felt for him. I have been the attorney beating his (her) head against a wall trying to help a client who acts for all the world like he doesn't want help, although it's really his inability to express it, or to offer thanks.

 I have also had the phone calls with the therapists who want to talk bout their political beliefs about drugs and vaccines, and that's nice, SHUT UP ALREADY YOU'RE HURTING THE CLIENT. So I found the book deeply upsetting, not because the content bothered me, but because it went straight to my gut and almost made me queasy. That's why it's 3 stars, because while I liked it, it made my stomach churn too much for me to really say I enjoyed it.

1451,Horns,Joe Hill,2010,2010,"Ignatius Perrish spent the night drunk and doing terrible things. He woke up the next morning with a thunderous hangover, a raging headache . . . and a pair of horns growing from his temples.
At first Ig thought the horns were a hallucination, the product of a mind damaged by rage and grief. He had spent the last year in a lonely, private purgatory, following the death of his beloved, Merrin Williams, who was raped and murdered under inexplicable circumstances. A mental breakdown would have been the most natural thing in the world. But there was nothing natural about the horns, which were all too real.
Once the righteous Ig had enjoyed the life of the blessed: born into privilege, the second son of a renowned musician and younger brother of a rising late-night TV star, he had security, wealth, and a place in his community. Ig had it all, and more--he had Merrin and a love founded on shared daydreams, mutual daring, and unlikely midsummer magic.
But Merrin's death damned all that. The only suspect in the crime, Ig was never charged or tried. And he was never cleared. In the court of public opinion in Gideon, New Hampshire, Ig is and always will be guilty because his rich and connected parents pulled strings to make the investigation go away. Nothing Ig can do, nothing he can say, matters. Everyone, it seems, including God, has abandoned him. Everyone, that is, but the devil inside. . . .",Nonfiction,Intermediate,2,10,15,12.5,14,3.92,68131,4.0,"I loved this. It's very imaginative and really horrible (you know, in the good way), and pretty funny in places. The story is original and off-kilter and the psychology of each character is masterfully revealed. 
 Mysteries abound, and the trail of crumbs leading to their resolution is tantalizing. 
 Ig is fantastic. He's just, you know, this guy. Except he'd not just a guy, and he never was ""just"" anything. I loved the childhood stuff. His whole morality was realistic and understandable and though it was pretty ""normal,"" it wasn't boring. Ig wasn't boring, is what I'm trying to say. He was brave and loyal and fun. I also thought the Hill did a helluva (ha) job creating a sense of danger, in said childhood. I was nervous the whole time. It was clear that there was a lot not-right with Lee, and I worried for Ig every time he came in contact with him. I can't say enough how much I enjoyed Ig's evolution, from sad-sack-loser-murder suspect to, well, to what he becomes. 
 Merrin could have been a total Mary Sue, but she had a bit of an edge when she was allowed center stage. She was a little too good to be true at times, but not unbearably so. 
 Lee was fascinating, and Terry was...hmm. He'd be a good older brother to have, I think. I didn't get as much of a handle on him, but he was loyal to Ig and loved him, and that was handled really well. 
 I was gutted by the stuff that Ig's family said to him under the influence of the horns. Ugh, especially the Vera stuff. I think the whole Vera thing was completely justified (without giving too much away, she totally deserved it). 
 Oh, and I have to say I adored what happened with Posada and Stutz. I'd have liked to know more, repercussion-wise, about the priest and the nun. The think about Merrin's dad, at the end, was a nice touch.

Faced with a new year but no new love, Phoebe concocts a different kind of resolution.

Factor in meddlesome colleagues, friends with benefits, getting frisky al fresco and maybe, possibly, true love and Phoebe's got her work cut out for her.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,5,9,12,10.0,6,3.94,1074,4.0,"The List is a book that caught my eye because it looked like a story that would be full of hilarious disasters as well as some romance. The List follows the story of Phoebe Henderson, a thirty something woman who's been single for over a year after she found her boyfriend in bed with his boss. The book begin's on New Year's Eve with Phoebe partying in a hotel with her friends as she does every year, but she wants the new year to be different. Instead of making those resolutions that nobody ever keeps like I will go to the gym everyday or I will eat healthier food, she decides she's going to improve her sex life. So, she decides to a create a list of ten things. Ten new things to do in bed that she's never tried before. But first, she's got to find someone to help her... 
 Although the main plot of the book revolves around Phoebe and her sex life, this isn't a work of erotica. Sure, a lot of sexually explicit material but it doesn't quite cross the boundary into erotica and it's by nothing like Fifty Shades of Grey (though there is some bondage involved). I suppose it would be rather interesting to take a feminist slant on The List because it's all about a woman striving for sexual liberation, rather than a boyfriend or a husband. Sex isn't a taboo subject in this novel and it's okay for women to have multiple sexual partners without her seemingly 'easy' or 'slutty'. This story isn't about a woman who just wants to have more sex, it's about a woman who actually wants to make a change in her life and sex is a major part of that. 
 I like that the main character, Phoebe, seems to be a relatively 'normal' person. She's hasn't got some sort of glamorous job or amazing figure, she isn't insanely rich and she doesn't fall in love with a prince. This story is all so ordinary and that's what makes it so good. It isn't 'ordinary' in a bad way, I simply mean that it's slightly more realistic than other novels to the point where I could actually envisage most the characters being real people. This is actually quite a feat since a lot of the characters do very stupid and things throughout, but I never thought 'this is ridiculous'. I guess the fact that this book seems almost 'real' is what makes it so funny. 
 That said, I found the ending to be a little disappointing. I have to admit that I couldn't predict what the ending would be as Bolouri doesn't tie all the lose strings up until the very, very end which means that there are multiple possibilities for an ending throughout and I liked this. However, when it became clear what the ending was going to be, I felt like everything was really rushed and that when I finished reading the book I found myself wanting to know more. As The List is a standalone novel this is a little frustrating. It's not like there was a massive chunk of the story missing or anything, I just wish there had been a few more pages added to the end. 
 All in all, I found The List to be a highly amusing and easy read. I really liked all the characters as they seemed like 'real' people and this made it easy to get into Phoebe's world. Phoebe, as a character, is admirable and I think this book is perfect for women who are in a bit of rut and are looking for that extra push to make a change in their lives. It doesn't have to involve sexual experimentation as it does with Phoebe, but certain aspects of this book are pretty inspiring. If you're the sort of person that feels uncomfortable reading about sex, then this probably isn't the book for you. Then again, like Phoebe, you could be brave and give new things a try!",0.0,0,2916,8718.84,2.99,943,3,2,4

Suddenly the Hunt family, who only want to fit in, are directly in the spotlight. For Jacob's mother, Emma, it's a brutal reminder of the intolerance and misunderstanding that always threaten her family.

1469,Ender'S Shadow,Orson Scott Card,1999,1999,"Ender's Shadowis being dubbed as a parallel novel to Orson Scott Card's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Ender's Game. By ""parallel,"" Card means that Shadowbegins and ends at roughly the same time as Game, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity's fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of Shadow, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know.
Although it may seem like Shadowis merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous Ender's Game, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of Ender's Gamehinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, Shadowmanages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that Shadow, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. --Craig E. Engler",Nonfiction,Intermediate,1,15,15,15.0,2,4.3,1211,5.0,"As great as Ender's Game. Obviously it probably couldn't stand on it's own, but it is an excellent companion novel to Ender's Game.

1481,The Blind Assassin,Margaret Atwood,2000,2001,"Margaret Atwood takes the art of storytelling to new heights in a dazzling novel that unfolds layer by astonishing layer and concludes in a brilliant and wonderfully satisfying twist. Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and cliches of the 1930s and 1940s, The Blind Assassin is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience.
It opens with these simple, resonant words: ""Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge."" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a- novel. Entitled The Blind Assassin, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.
For the past twenty-five years, Margaret Atwood has written works of striking originality and imagination. In The Blind Assassin, she stretches the limits of her accomplishments as never before, creating a novel that is entertaining and profoundly serious. The Blind Assassin proves once again that Atwood is one of the most talented, daring, and exciting writers of our time.

But with the unexpected return of Claude, Edgar's paternal uncle, turmoil consumes the Sawtelles' once peaceful home.

Written by one of fiction's most audaciously original talents Anansi Boysis a kaleidoscopic journey deep into myth that is at once startling, terrifying and fiercely funny.
Includes extra material: An interview with Neil Gaiman and reading-group discussion questions.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,3,1,13,7.333333333333333,2,4.01,1919,4.0,"To be quite honest with you, I didn't particularly like the first third of this book. It's got nothing to do with the way it's written (Neil Gaiman is as funny and imaginative as ever), it was something else. The things is, I'm a sucker for sibling relationships and I was pleasantly surprised to find one in this book. But Spider and Fat Charlie spend the first half of this book arguing and generally making each others lives hell and it just made me uncomfortable. There were other things too, like Charlies personality and the plot itself, while not being bad at all, they just didn't appeal to me that greatly. 
 HOWEVER, I continued reading and I am now unbelievably happy I did. After, well, not half the book, but almost, the plot changes. To me it seems as if the books has got two different stories in it, the story of Spider and Charlie's relationship and then the story of everything else. Everything else takes over half way through the book, and it gets really interesting. It also forces Charlie and Spider to start acting like brothers and working together instead of tearing each other apart, and that made me like especially Fat Charlie a lot more. 
 What really turned this book around for me, though, was the ending. I sit here, a day after finishing it, with a feeling of absolute satisfaction. I rarely get that from a book, sure I've read books with brilliant, fantastic endings, books that ended exactly the way I wanted them to, but never one that left me so satisfied on all fronts. I believe the biggest contributive to this feeling is Charlie. The one and only. He undergoes some serious changes in the book, and comes out on the other side as one of my favourite characters in fiction. His change from someone I sort of dislike, to someone I utterly love is so complete, and so brilliantly done, that I can't help but feel satisfied. 
 This is why in the end it gets 4 stars. It wasn't perfect, perhaps, but it was still fantastic. 
 Oh, and perhaps I should mention, I listened to some of the audiobook at one point, and while I'm not usually a fan of this, I was pleased I did it, because it helped me sort out my ""inner Spider"" voice. I'd gotten the way he talks completely wrong, and I liked him a lot better when I got it right. (I know it sounds that weird it should matter that much, but there was really quite a difference between my Spider and the audiobook's Spider.

 I find it hard to review these books. How do you review books that are Fantasy classics? These are books that everybody already knows are good. I find it difficult to express how great these books are. I mean besides Lord of the Rings this has to be considered the best classic Epic Fantasy right? Well I guess I will just take it book by book and see what happens. This is yet another great book in this series. What a wonderful story. Awesome characters. The worldbuilding is just fantastic. Robert Jordan deserves his reputation as the outstanding author he was. This series deserves it's place near the top of all epic fantasy. The adventures of Rand, Perrin, and Mat are truly epic. Classic fantasy at it's best. You have reluctant heroes, Dark powers, magic, diverse people, and great battles. 
 Overall another great book in the series. It has some wonderfully memorable moments. It is also is beginning to slow down a bit. I don't mind so much because I am so attached to the characters and the story, but I can see were all the complaining comes from. I am looking forward to continuing this fantastic series. 
 The only regret I have with this book, and the series is that I did not read it sooner! I can see now that I am going to be obsessed with this series. I finally know what all the hype was about from all the WoT fans out there. Now I am one of you. I wanted to read the whole series this year (As you can see I am very behind). 
 As you know if you have read my reviews before I am not about long reviews with synopsis and spoilers. I just give my opinion on my experience with this book and you can take it from there. Now on to the next book.

It tells a heartbreaking, fascinating and absorbing story of a woman with multiple personality disorder, which is a dissociative disorder. I've heard over the years that the story is more fiction than non-fiction, but I still like the book just as much as I did when I believed it was 100% true.

1498,The Blind Assassin,Margaret Atwood,2000,2001,"Margaret Atwood takes the art of storytelling to new heights in a dazzling novel that unfolds layer by astonishing layer and concludes in a brilliant and wonderfully satisfying twist. Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and cliches of the 1930s and 1940s, The Blind Assassin is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience.
It opens with these simple, resonant words: ""Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge."" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a- novel. Entitled The Blind Assassin, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.
For the past twenty-five years, Margaret Atwood has written works of striking originality and imagination. In The Blind Assassin, she stretches the limits of her accomplishments as never before, creating a novel that is entertaining and profoundly serious. The Blind Assassin proves once again that Atwood is one of the most talented, daring, and exciting writers of our time. Like The Handmaid's Tale, it is destined to become a classic.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,7,6,14,8.857142857142858,15,3.95,100153,4.0,"- So are you still trudging through the Margaret Atwood? 
 - George, you should stop being so dismissive! Have you ever read it? 
 - Well, I think I got as far as chapter three. Typical po-mo cleverness with a story inside a story inside... anyway, I decided I couldn't take any more, so I gave up. 
 - So do you want to know what it's about? 
 - You're going to tell me, aren't you? 
 - Only if you want me to. 
 - Okay, okay. I want you to. Snuggle up and tell me all about it. Satisfied? 
 - Mmm. Well, satisfied for now anyway. You know, George, you actually might like it. Some of it's a bit depressing, but there's this very sexy thread where in each episode she meets her lover, and they lie in bed together and he tells her this bizarre science-fiction story... 
 - A bit like we're doing now? 
 - A bit. 
 - I like that. So what kind of story is it? 
 - Well, he's a pulp SF writer, so it's very pulpy, but in a good way. There's this planet with three suns and seven moons and deadly mountains haunted by beautiful nude undead women with azure hair and eyes like snake-filled pits... 
 - That does sound sexy. I like the snake-filled pits too. 
 - I knew you would. And he's telling it in a very clever, ironic way, and some of the time he's just having fun, and some of the time it's sort of about him and her. 
 - Where does the blind assassin come in? 
 - Well, in the science-fiction story, there's this character who's a blind master assassin. That's sort of the guy telling the story. And he falls in love with this beautiful girl, who's supposed to be sacrificed on the altar. She's sort of the girl he's telling the story to. 
 - How could a master assassin be blind? 
 - Honestly, George, don't be so literal about everything. Anyway, you liked Daredevil, didn't you? 
 - Okay, you got me. Carry on. 
 - Well, the science-fiction story is the innermost one. The guy and the girl are characters in a book that was written by a girl who killed herself by driving off a bridge... 
 - Why did she kill herself? 
 - You don't find out until the end of the book. It's a whydunnit... 
 - You mean there's a plot and everything? 
 - Honestly, George, of course there's a plot! There's even a twist. 
 - Wow. Okay, so the girl killed herself driving off the bridge? 
 - Yes, and her sister, who's now very old, is writing about her and her book, and what happened to make her write it. 
 - And I suppose the book she wrote is about stuff that happened to her and her sister? 
 - Could be. I don't want to drop too many spoilers. 
 - I still don't see why it has to be so complicated. 
 - Well, you thought Inception was great, didn't you? All those layers? 
 - Yeah... 
 - Okay, it's a bit like that. It really works. But you'd have trouble explaining why to someone who hadn't seen it. 
 - Mmm. 
 - Mmm? 
 - You know, it's Valentine's Day. 
 - It is. Sorry, I won't try and sell you any more Margaret Atwood for a while. George. Mmm. 
 - Mmm. 
 - Mmm!

1499,The Signature Of All Things,Elizabeth Gilbert,2013,2014,"In The Signature of All Things, Elizabeth Gilbert returns to fiction, inserting her inimitable voice into an enthralling story of love, adventure and discovery. Spanning much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the novel follows the fortunes of the extraordinary Whittaker family as led by the enterprising Henry Whittaker--a poor-born Englishman who makes a great fortune in the South American quinine trade, eventually becoming the richest man in Philadelphia. Born in 1800, Henry's brilliant daughter, Alma (who inherits both her father's money and his mind), ultimately becomes a botanist of considerable gifts herself. As Alma's research takes her deeper into the mysteries of evolution, she falls in love with a man named Ambrose Pike who makes incomparable paintings of orchids and who draws her in the exact opposite direction -- into the realm of the spiritual, the divine, and the magical. Alma is a clear-minded scientist; Ambrose a utopian artist -- but what unites this unlikely couple is a desperate need to understand the workings of this world and the mechanisms behind all life.
Exquisitely researched and told at a galloping pace, The Signature of All Things soars across the globe--from London to Peru to Philadelphia to Tahiti to Amsterdam, and beyond. Along the way, the story is peopled with unforgettable characters: missionaries, abolitionists, adventurers, astronomers, sea captains, geniuses, and the quite mad. But most memorable of all, it is the story of Alma Whittaker, who -- born in the Age of Enlightenment, but living well into the Industrial Revolution -- bears witness to that extraordinary moment in human history when all the old assumptions about science, religion, commerce, and class were exploding into dangerous new ideas. Written in the bold, questing spirit of that singular time, Gilbert's wise, deep, and spellbinding tale is certain to capture the hearts and minds of readers.

At first Ig thought the horns were a hallucination, the product of a mind damaged by rage and grief. He had spent the last year in a lonely, private purgatory, following the death of his beloved, Merrin Williams, who was raped and murdered under inexplicable circumstances. A mental breakdown would have been the most natural thing in the world. But there was nothing natural about the horns, which were all too real.
Once the righteous Ig had enjoyed the life of the blessed: born into privilege, the second son of a renowned musician and younger brother of a rising late-night TV star, he had security, wealth, and a place in his community. Ig had it all, and more--he had Merrin and a love founded on shared daydreams, mutual daring, and unlikely midsummer magic.
But Merrin's death damned all that. The only suspect in the crime, Ig was never charged or tried. And he was never cleared. In the court of public opinion in Gideon, New Hampshire, Ig is and always will be guilty because his rich and connected parents pulled strings to make the investigation go away. Nothing Ig can do, nothing he can say, matters. Everyone, it seems, including God, has abandoned him.

 The beginning of the story was bleh for me because I just wanted to get to the boat and I didn't see any reason for that beginning. Then when you're on the boat and the beginning is used against the main character, Lo Blacklock, I began to understand. 
 Lo is a travel journalist and is finally getting to go on a trip because her boss is preggers. Unfortunately for her, she sees a body get thrown off the boat, no one believes her, she has no proof and when she does get proof, it gets removed. She wonders if she's crazy or what. 
 I just wanted to get to the end to see what in the world was going on and who did what, when and how. I certainly didn't think it was actually what happened. Then throughout the book there were reports of Lo Blacklock's death and they found a body and I was like, ""What?""

A subsequent team, including a sign-language-speaking simian named Amy, follows the original team's tracks only to be subjected to more mysterious and grisly gorilla attacks. If you can look past the breathless treatment of '80s technology, like voice-recognition software and 256K RAM modules (the book was written in 1980), you'll find the same smart use of science and edge-of-your-seat suspense shared by Crichton's other work. --Paul Hughes

 Bridget came across as charming and endearing in the first book but here she becomes annoying and irritating. I (or the readers) love her int he first book because Bridget is not flawless.

GOD IS DEAD
MEET THE KIDS
Fat Charlie Nancy is not having a good week. His estranged father recently dropped dead on a karaoke stage and has left Fat Charlie with much more than embarrassment. Because, you see, Charlie has discovered that his dad wasn't just any dad. He was Anansi the trickster spider-god. Anansi is the spirit of rebellion, able to overturn the social order, create wealth out of thin air, and even baffle the devil. No wonder Fat Charlie's life is about to be turned upside down.
Written by one of fiction's most audaciously original talents Anansi Boysis a kaleidoscopic journey deep into myth that is at once startling, terrifying and fiercely funny.
Includes extra material: An interview with Neil Gaiman and reading-group discussion questions.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,3,1,13,7.333333333333333,2,4.01,1919,4.0,"To be quite honest with you, I didn't particularly like the first third of this book. It's got nothing to do with the way it's written (Neil Gaiman is as funny and imaginative as ever), it was something else. The things is, I'm a sucker for sibling relationships and I was pleasantly surprised to find one in this book. But Spider and Fat Charlie spend the first half of this book arguing and generally making each others lives hell and it just made me uncomfortable. There were other things too, like Charlies personality and the plot itself, while not being bad at all, they just didn't appeal to me that greatly. 
 HOWEVER, I continued reading and I am now unbelievably happy I did. After, well, not half the book, but almost, the plot changes. To me it seems as if the books has got two different stories in it, the story of Spider and Charlie's relationship and then the story of everything else. Everything else takes over half way through the book, and it gets really interesting. It also forces Charlie and Spider to start acting like brothers and working together instead of tearing each other apart, and that made me like especially Fat Charlie a lot more. 
 What really turned this book around for me, though, was the ending. I sit here, a day after finishing it, with a feeling of absolute satisfaction. I rarely get that from a book, sure I've read books with brilliant, fantastic endings, books that ended exactly the way I wanted them to, but never one that left me so satisfied on all fronts. I believe the biggest contributive to this feeling is Charlie. The one and only. He undergoes some serious changes in the book, and comes out on the other side as one of my favourite characters in fiction. His change from someone I sort of dislike, to someone I utterly love is so complete, and so brilliantly done, that I can't help but feel satisfied. 
 This is why in the end it gets 4 stars. It wasn't perfect, perhaps, but it was still fantastic. 
 Oh, and perhaps I should mention, I listened to some of the audiobook at one point, and while I'm not usually a fan of this, I was pleased I did it, because it helped me sort out my ""inner Spider"" voice. I'd gotten the way he talks completely wrong, and I liked him a lot better when I got it right. (I know it sounds that weird it should matter that much, but there was really quite a difference between my Spider and the audiobook's Spider. So I can recommend that!)",15.0,1,790,1572.1,1.99,142,2,2,4

The beautiful, cool Junan is wed to Li Ang in an arranged marriage, and is surprised when she falls in love with him. During the 1930s when Japan invades China, soldier Li Ang is stationed in a far city. Pregnant Junan is unable to travel so she sends plain, poetic Yinan to care for his household.

1512,Ender'S Shadow,Orson Scott Card,1999,1999,"Ender's Shadowis being dubbed as a parallel novel to Orson Scott Card's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Ender's Game. By ""parallel,"" Card means that Shadowbegins and ends at roughly the same time as Game, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity's fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of Shadow, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know.
Although it may seem like Shadowis merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous Ender's Game, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of Ender's Gamehinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, Shadowmanages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that Shadow, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. --Craig E. Engler",Nonfiction,Intermediate,1,15,15,15.0,2,4.3,1211,4.0,"I enjoyed this book better than Ender's Game, of which this is the sequel. There was so much more depth to this book and more background information about the Battle School. It was good to see it in the perspective of Bean instead of Ender. Even though I knew what was coming, it still didn't lack some suspense as there were a few new situations we weren't aware of in Ender's Game. I am looking forward to reading more in this series.

Really bad. Really, really, really bad. Plus, some of the plot points simply made no sense. There are certain things you can suspend your disbelief to and that's fine and normal when it comes to any form of fiction, as long as it makes sense in their world the author created, but there is a limit. There's no way a detective would bring the mother of a victim along with him to interview witnesses and get statements. It..... No, just no. 
 Unless, he wasn't really a detective and was only hired to act like one so Kate could find the truth. If this was the case, then I'm fine with it. However, that doesn't happen. He's just a cop who is investigating the suspicious death of a girl and decides that it would be fun to let the dead girl's mom take lead in the investigation. 
 Yea...that would never happen. Never. 
 Also, the adults sounded and acted like teenagers. Once you get to the end, you'll understand what I mean. The whole thing was just ridiculous. 
 Great potential here, but it's wasted by bad writing, a plot that falls short, and characters that are just too stupid and not believable. 
 I'm seriously disappointed, because I really wanted to like this book and it just fell flat. I could probably write more about how the relationship between Kate and Amelia was mostly showing not telling and despite making it seem like the two were super close, they felt really distant from one another. Or I could write about how the whole Ben subplot was creepy and awkward. Or I could even talk about the Magpies, whose secret circle isn't really all that secret. Or even about how everyone magically reveals their secrets within the last few pages, wrapping up all of the loose ends in a convenient little bow. 
 But I won't. 
 Because the main problem with this novel isn't really the plot, or the lack of brains the characters seem to have, it's the writing. I almost feel like with a better author the stupid plot points maybe would have become plot perks or something. Instead, the book is just lackluster and boring. And a novel with this much potential and this kind of plot shouldn't be boring. 
 Overall: I know there are a lot of people who loved this. Loved it to the point that it's going to be a movie starring Nicole Kidman. But I didn't like it. It was boring. It was unbelievable. And I just didn't enjoy reading this. This is McCreight's debut novel and she did have great ideas, so I'll probably pick up her next book to see what she'll come up with next.

Spanning much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the novel follows the fortunes of the extraordinary Whittaker family as led by the enterprising Henry Whittaker--a poor-born Englishman who makes a great fortune in the South American quinine trade, eventually becoming the richest man in Philadelphia. Born in 1800, Henry's brilliant daughter, Alma (who inherits both her father's money and his mind), ultimately becomes a botanist of considerable gifts herself. As Alma's research takes her deeper into the mysteries of evolution, she falls in love with a man named Ambrose Pike who makes incomparable paintings of orchids and who draws her in the exact opposite direction -- into the realm of the spiritual, the divine, and the magical. Alma is a clear-minded scientist; Ambrose a utopian artist -- but what unites this unlikely couple is a desperate need to understand the workings of this world and the mechanisms behind all life.
Exquisitely researched and told at a galloping pace, The Signature of All Things soars across the globe--from London to Peru to Philadelphia to Tahiti to Amsterdam, and beyond. Along the way, the story is peopled with unforgettable characters: missionaries, abolitionists, adventurers, astronomers, sea captains, geniuses, and the quite mad. But most memorable of all, it is the story of Alma Whittaker, who -- born in the Age of Enlightenment, but living well into the Industrial Revolution -- bears witness to that extraordinary moment in human history when all the old assumptions about science, religion, commerce, and class were exploding into dangerous new ideas.

 This story of a woman with sixteen personalities, purportedly based on real life, hooked me at the time of reading it. It was one of the factors getting me interested in ""pop"" psychology. Now I hear that it has been challenged (like so many similar books), but that does not take away from its fascination. 
 The book is well-written, even though the scenes of child abuse (by Sybil's schizophrenic mother) are graphic and disturbing. However, it lost a bit of steam towards the end, as there is no clear description of Sybil's healing process.

1523,This Is How You Lose Her,Junot Díaz,2012,2012,"On a beach in the Dominican Republic, a doomed relationship flounders. In the heat of a hospital laundry room in New Jersey, a woman does her lover's washing and thinks about his wife. In Boston, a man buys his love child, his only son, a first baseball bat and glove. At the heart of these stories is the irrepressible, irresistible Yunior, a young hardhead whose longing for love is equaled only by his recklessness--and by the extraordinary women he loves and loses: artistic Alma; the aging Miss Lora; Magdalena, who thinks all Dominican men are cheaters; and the love of his life, whose heartbreak ultimately becomes his own.
In prose that is endlessly energetic, inventive, tender, and funny, the stories in This Is How You Lose Herlay bare the infinite longing and inevitable weakness of the human heart. They remind us that passion always triumphs over experience, and that ""the half-life of love is forever.""",Nonfiction,Intermediate,6,6,15,8.833333333333334,5,3.75,68125,2.0,"This is a collection of short stories about Yunior. Yunior is a louse. All the men in his life are serial cheaters from his father to his brother to his best friend. Yes, there is a pitch that this is part of the Dominican Culture -- but frankly I can speak with women friends of mine from France, Spain, Italy, Russia, Germany and England and every single one of them knows this guy or has dated this clown. He screws around on women, and when he is caught and discarded there is great chest thumping and hair tearing and he learns...nothing. 
 Mr. Diaz provides imagery fireworks -- great use of language, flying sentences, created a real louse of a character (Yunior) who keeps you reading because, well it's like watching a bad driver wreck his same car in the same way 5 or six times. 
 My big problem with this book is that is left me unmoved and oddly unfeeling, considering the subject matter. Took me a while to figure it out. 
 There is not one fully drawn women character in any of these stories. In fact, there is one story that took me until page six to figure out it was supposed to be a female character. The women are merely devices to allow Yunior to react to something. Even he, Mr Diaz, on his website talks about his inability to create female characters -- he's male. Had the writer gotten past this, as many male writers do, he coud have opened up the story to a real look at this explosive topic.",216.0,1,31536,169663.68,5.38,865,5,2,3
1524,The Bonesetter'S Daughter,Amy Tan,2001,2001,"Ruth Young and her widowed mother, LuLing, have always had a tumultuous relationship. Now, before she succumbs to forgetfulness, LuLing gives Ruth some of her writings, which reveal a side of LuLing that Ruth has never known. . . .
In a remote mountain village where ghosts and tradition rule, LuLing grows up in the care of her mute Precious Auntie as the family endures a curse laid upon a relative known as the bonesetter. When headstrong LuLing rejects the marriage proposal of the coffinmaker, a shocking series of events are set in motion-all of which lead back to Ruth and LuLing in modern San Francisco. The truth that Ruth learns from her mother's past will forever change her perception of family, love, and forgiveness.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,16,2,14,8.375,9,3.98,997,3.0,"Like The Joy Luck Club, this book is about relationships between mothers and daughters, and the importance of knowing each other's life stories. In the first part of the book, we meet Ruth, a first generation Chinese-American working as a ghostwriter for New Age self-help books in California. She has a hard time asserting herself in her ten-year relationship with her boyfriend. Her mother, LuLing, has been recently diagnosed with dementia, and can no longer live alone. LuLing is depressed, critical, sends her daughter on guilt trips, and threatens to commit suicide whenever she is crossed. She believes in superstitions and curses, and needs to communicate with the dead when she makes important decisions. 
 The second part of the book tells the story of LuLing and the bonesetter's daughter back in China. This memoir written by LuLing, was my favorite part of the book. LuLing was part of a rural family that made high quality ink that was used in calligraphy. Both LuLing and her mother faced difficult challenges, and were never totally accepted by her father's family. In her teens, LuLing was taken in by missionaries during the Japanese occupation of China, and she later immigrated to the United States. LuLing's journal gives Ruth the knowledge to understand her mother better, and to make sense of Ruth's childhood. 
 The third part of the book is set in the present, and easy solutions are found for both LuLing's and Ruth's problems. A thread seems to tie the three generations of women together in strong, but difficult, mother-daughter relationships. 
 I had mixed feelings about this book. The first part of the book, about Ruth's problems and LuLing's negative parenting, dragged for me. The second part, set in China, was exciting with wonderful characters--the bonesetter grandfather, the wicked relatives, LuLing's first love, the suicidal nursemaid. The short third part brought things together well, but seemed to promise an almost too rosy future.",9.0,1,266,263.34,0.99,340,1,3,2

But one night, Marian answers a knock on the door . . . only to find Kirby Rose, an eighteen-year-old girl with a key to a past that Marian thought she had sealed off forever. From the moment Kirby appears on her doorstep, Marian's perfectly constructed world--and her very identity--will be shaken to its core, resurrecting ghosts and memories of a passionate young love affair that threaten everything that has come to define her.

It never really gets any better and in fact, the last 50 pages i just breezed through. No doubt about it, this was a book all about adoption. I also felt this was MUCH more Kirby's story than Marion's. I didn't feel like we really got to know this shallow woman - perhaps because half of the book was written from Kirby's point-of-view.

Our hero is selected, and when asked what he would like, opts for a single bell from Santa's sleigh. 
 I knew that I could have any gift I could imagine. But the thing I wanted most for Christmas was not inside Santa's giant bag. What I wanted more than anything was one silver bell from Santa's sleigh. When I asked, Santa smiled. Then he gave me a hug and told an elf to cut a bell from a reindeer's harness. The elf tossed it up to Santa. He stood, holding the bell high above him, and called out, ""The first gift of Christmas!""

(An Introductory Note)
The Langoliers
Secret Window, Secret Garden
The Library Policeman
The Sun Dog",Nonfiction,Intermediate,22,1,13,3.3181818181818183,12,3.9,77840,4.0,"A re-read after more than twenty years. Will it stand up? 
 Short answer: Absolutely. :) 
 The Langoliers fits snugly in the New Weird category, pretty much entirely esoteric SF with gremlin-types, alternate dimenions and/or time travel on a plane... There are no snakes here! :) The characters are a blast and we've got a firm horror vibe going on here where we are kept guessing as to who among all these random sleepers will make it to the end. Thoroughly enjoyable novella, but not my favorite. It's probably best that it was relegated to a TV movie. :) 
 My favorite is a toss up between Secret Window, Secret Garden, and The Library Police. 
 First, though, Secret Window, Secret Garden, which only slightly resembles the movie with Johnny Depp, or at least more or less. :) 
 This one was pretty fantastic for the writing insights, the plagiarism scare, the descent into paranoia, and the general ultimate break from reality. What's better than a writer being driven completely crazy by a story and/or a man with a definite grudge over a story? No spoilers, but so many wonderful twists happen, couldn't help but fall in love all over again. 
 And then there's The Library Police, which is a wonderful twist on early childhood nightmares, a diatribe on fear, Red Licorice, and a cool twist on vampirism. It was definitely probably the most effective and convoluted of all the novellas in this book, I think, and also the most scarily fantastic, diving into some of the most weird and eerie escapades, even outdoing Secret Window, Secret Garden on several levels, but maybe not as much for the MC. 
 The last novella, The Sun Dog, is classic SK not only for setting dropping and character dropping, but also in the twist he's known for... turning everyday objects into a nightmare of continuing and evolving proportions, driving all those involved into a deeper and deeper despair and fear. :) 
 Does SK have a think about mad dogs? Even Cujo was referenced here. But the dog in the photograph has got to be even better in this novella. It's absolutely more elusive and menacing, giving up on immediate danger and far-off menace for a much more paranormal and evil menace that gave me, at least, a more pervasive and ongoing fear. 
 It also happened to be my least favorite of the bunch, but it was still effective. :) 
 The middle two were plainly amazing, though. :)",74.0,1,37368,201039.84,5.38,779,5,5,4

 I wasn't really feeling this book. It was semi-similar to Since You've Been Gone by Morgan Matson in the sense that there is a introverted and shy main character who has always been outshined by her outgoing best friend and finds her confidence throughout. I LOVED Since You've Been Gone (my second to last read before this one) and I continually was thinking ""Wow, I liked that book better. I wish I was re-reading that book."" (even though they are pretty different books). I love many of Sarah Dessen's books and bought this one five years ago because of that (back in the days when BookTube wasn't a thing and I had limited knowledge of other authors), but I never really felt the urge to pick this one up (hence the reason it was last on my TBR list). 
 As for the book, I didn't really like or connect to any of the characters and Macon was my absolute least favorite. I also felt like this book dragged even though it was less than 300 pages long.

1530,Congo,Michael Crichton,1980,2015,"If you saw the 1995 film adaptation of this Crichton thriller, somebody owes you an apology. While you're waiting for that to happen, try reading the vastly more intelligent novel on which the movie was based. The broad lines of the plot remain the same: A research team deep in the jungle disappears after a mysterious and grisly gorilla attack. A subsequent team, including a sign-language-speaking simian named Amy, follows the original team's tracks only to be subjected to more mysterious and grisly gorilla attacks. If you can look past the breathless treatment of '80s technology, like voice-recognition software and 256K RAM modules (the book was written in 1980), you'll find the same smart use of science and edge-of-your-seat suspense shared by Crichton's other work. --Paul Hughes

Additionally, the characters tasked with finding the lost city of Zinj -- expedition leader Karen Ross, mercenary Charles Munro, gorilla expert Peter Elliot, and of course, female gorilla Amy -- were very well developed considering how fast the story moved and the length of the novel. 
 However, while I really do like the directness of Crichton's prose, the novel was a bit too frenetic to build the tension that Crichton seemed to desire, and the deus ex machina ending The remaining team members escaping in a hot air balloon found inside the crashed plane. seemed rather convenient considering the difficulties the characters had travelling to that point.

That being said, even though I have read nearly everything he has written under any pen name, this is the only review I plan to write for the extensive King library. 
 What is unique about this book was that it barely stepped into the usual worlds of Stephen King. It is a story about how a young girl survives being lost in the woods. And while there are some supernatural elements in it, they are not the overriding storyline. The focus is more on her psychological battle to survive. It's a tale of courage and the strength of will.

But Kate's stress over leaving work quickly turns to panic when she arrives at the school and finds it surrounded by police officers, fire trucks, and an ambulance.

Reconstructing Ameliais about secret first loves, old friendships, and an all-girls club steeped in tradition. But, most of all, it's the story of how far a mother will go to vindicate the memory of a daughter whose life she couldn't save.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,1,16,16,16.0,2,3.82,88672,5.0,"This book. This. Fucking. Book. You see all those other reviews talking about how it was unputdownable, and how they never believed something so cliche before this book? You know how you're rolling your eyes right now at those comments? Stop it. They are all true. This book handily usurped Gone Girl as the best book I have read in the past year. Make no mistake, however, this book is absolutely heartwrenching in so many ways I cannot describe absent spoilers. 
 This book is many things, which makes it incredibly difficult to genre classify. It is a poignant story about a single mother and successful career woman (Kate) doing the best she can to raise daughter, but following Amelia's death, she cannot escape her own regrets and guilt over what happened, feeling like had she been a better parent, she could have prevented it. 
 It is also a beautiful coming of age tale for 15 year old Amelia, as well as several of the tertiary teenage characters, and explores first love and heartbreak, and the bonds of friendship anbd loyalty, in a delicate and beautiful, yet highly realistic, way. 
 Perhaps most important, this is a book about secrets. Secrets abound in this book. Everyone has a secret, and by the end, you will know their secrets too. Portions of the book have a very Gossip Girl feel, and I mean that in the best way possible. The reader is provided juicy tidbits of gossip as the story unfolds, and these developments are made in such a way that you can't help but want to hear more, because it gives true insight into the world Amelia lived in, and the person she was. The pacing was absolutely excellent. 
 The story vacillates between events unfolding in the present and events that occurred in the past. Each chapter is narrated by either Kate or Amelia, except those in an epistolary format, constructed through texts, and facebook and blog posts. I found this a brilliant formatting choice, as the story unfolded for the reader practically simultaneously as it did for Kate. 
 Oh god, the characters in this book. So real, so multi-faceted. So relatable. Even the more ""cliched"" characters had dimensions and layers. I don't have kids, but I truly felt for Kate. My heart broke for her. Perhaps it is because for a portion of my life I was raised every day by a single mom, working a full time job, who often had to leave me with babysitters until early evening. I can understand that a mother may feel guilty about that, even if many people, her children included, do not believe that she should. Likewise, I strongly identified with Amelia, who fully understood why her mom was so absentee. 
 This book really drilled home the point that the quality of the time they spent together mattered so much more than the quantity. The emotions in this book. Oh, they run the gamut - jealousy, betrayal, hatred, admiration, and love. There is so much love in this book. The love Kate and Amelia feel for each other oozes off the pages. I won't say much more about the nuanced emotions and relationships present in the book, lest I spoil. 
 Also, it appears that high school girls are still bitches. I graduated before household internet was mainstream; before AOL's seemingly self-replicating floppies provided millions of households with free coasters. High school tormenting was much more covert in those days, rumors spread through whispers and giggles in the hallway, and you just hoped that the rumors died before proliferating throughout the school. This book makes deft use of the ways in which the digital age have changed the rumor mill, and thus, changed the ways in which high schoolers can torment each other in perpetuity. Nothing dies on the internet. The digital footprint is always there. Makes it much harder to forget and move onto the next rumor. 
 Ultimately, I cannot recommend this book enough. I was only about 80 or 100 pages in last night when I curled up in bed with my Nook, as I do every night, planning to read a couple chapters as I fell asleep. Next thing I knew, I was 150 pages in, it was pretty late, but I could read ""just one more chapter."" Then 200...then 300...by the time I finished, it was far later than I should ever be awake during the week, but I regret not one moment of it.",401.0,1,5427,5372.73,0.99,447,4,1,4

This just felt like a mashup of a lot of classic dystopian novels rolled up into one, but it never really got close to the level of any of the books it was trying to be. A little bit of The Giver with some Fahrenheit 451 maybe some 1984 and then some elements of any other dystopian novel. This just never took off for me for some reason. 
 I was definitely drawn to the idea of the book and the world it described. The thought of a world controlled by language and what words must be used was interesting, but it played out more ridiculous on the book. I think the concept is good, just not enough there to make me care. Even at the beginning when the first bit of intrigue occurs and Marlo shows up unexpectedly and you're trying to figure out who he is and all that... I was just bored. 
 Hey, and it was cool how things sort of mirror our own world. The story of Noah's Ark is there, I mean with the same name and all, and there is this rebuilding and starting a new world after crazy events. That was cool. Like I said, there was some good stuff here that just needed someone to come along and breathe more life into it. I would go through an entire chapter sometimes and find my mind wandering off, and then I would snap back into it and realize I hadn't missed much. 
 So if dystopian is your thing, gives this a shot later this year. I've found plenty of great reviews out there. I just love the books it draws inspiration from, but felt this one didn't come anywhere close to being what it could have been. Oh, and the fact that you only get 500 words to use is a cool idea, but whew boy is it hard to read. It just got kind of silly. That's all.

And just as she gives up on finding a man who feels the same way, she meets warm, wonderful Ben. Things seem too good to be true when they fall in love and agree to buck tradition with a satisfying, child-free marriage. Then the unexpected occurs: one of them has a change of heart. One of them wants children after all. This is the witty, heartfelt story about what happens to the perfect couple when they suddenly want different things. It's about feeling that your life is set and then realizing that nothing is as you thought it was--and that there is no possible compromise. It's about deciding what is most important in life, and taking chances to get it.

Enter the lawyers. Nate O'Riley is fresh out of rehab, a disgraces corporate attorney handpicked for his last job: to Rachel Lane at any cost.

 Despite being fully engaged by the story, there are a few things I didn't like about the book. I found the main character Nate O'reilly completely unsympathetic. I was very disappointed that the story started out with such a bang and then ended with a whimper. Once again, Grisham could have used a better editor.

To the surprise and dismay of many, ownership was assumed by a 23-year-old college dropout, named Willie Traynor. The future of the paper looked grim until a young mother was brutally raped and murdered by a member of the notorious Padgitt family. Willie Traynor reported all the gruesome details, and his newspaper began to prosper.
The murderer, Danny Padgitt, was tried before a packed courthouse in Clanton, Mississippi. The trial came to a startling and dramatic end when the defendant threatened revenge against the jurors if they convicted him. Nevertheless, they found him guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison.

1541,The Blind Assassin,Margaret Atwood,2000,2001,"Margaret Atwood takes the art of storytelling to new heights in a dazzling novel that unfolds layer by astonishing layer and concludes in a brilliant and wonderfully satisfying twist. Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and cliches of the 1930s and 1940s, The Blind Assassin is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience.
It opens with these simple, resonant words: ""Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge."" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a- novel. Entitled The Blind Assassin, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.
For the past twenty-five years, Margaret Atwood has written works of striking originality and imagination. In The Blind Assassin, she stretches the limits of her accomplishments as never before, creating a novel that is entertaining and profoundly serious. The Blind Assassin proves once again that Atwood is one of the most talented, daring, and exciting writers of our time. Like The Handmaid's Tale, it is destined to become a classic.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,7,6,14,8.857142857142858,15,3.95,100153,4.0,"- So are you still trudging through the Margaret Atwood? 
 - George, you should stop being so dismissive! Have you ever read it? 
 - Well, I think I got as far as chapter three. Typical po-mo cleverness with a story inside a story inside... anyway, I decided I couldn't take any more, so I gave up. 
 - So do you want to know what it's about? 
 - You're going to tell me, aren't you? 
 - Only if you want me to. 
 - Okay, okay. I want you to. Snuggle up and tell me all about it. Satisfied? 
 - Mmm. Well, satisfied for now anyway. You know, George, you actually might like it. Some of it's a bit depressing, but there's this very sexy thread where in each episode she meets her lover, and they lie in bed together and he tells her this bizarre science-fiction story... 
 - A bit like we're doing now? 
 - A bit. 
 - I like that. So what kind of story is it? 
 - Well, he's a pulp SF writer, so it's very pulpy, but in a good way. There's this planet with three suns and seven moons and deadly mountains haunted by beautiful nude undead women with azure hair and eyes like snake-filled pits... 
 - That does sound sexy. I like the snake-filled pits too. 
 - I knew you would. And he's telling it in a very clever, ironic way, and some of the time he's just having fun, and some of the time it's sort of about him and her. 
 - Where does the blind assassin come in? 
 - Well, in the science-fiction story, there's this character who's a blind master assassin. That's sort of the guy telling the story. And he falls in love with this beautiful girl, who's supposed to be sacrificed on the altar. She's sort of the girl he's telling the story to. 
 - How could a master assassin be blind? 
 - Honestly, George, don't be so literal about everything. Anyway, you liked Daredevil, didn't you? 
 - Okay, you got me. Carry on. 
 - Well, the science-fiction story is the innermost one. The guy and the girl are characters in a book that was written by a girl who killed herself by driving off a bridge... 
 - Why did she kill herself? 
 - You don't find out until the end of the book. It's a whydunnit... 
 - You mean there's a plot and everything? 
 - Honestly, George, of course there's a plot! There's even a twist. 
 - Wow. Okay, so the girl killed herself driving off the bridge? 
 - Yes, and her sister, who's now very old, is writing about her and her book, and what happened to make her write it. 
 - And I suppose the book she wrote is about stuff that happened to her and her sister? 
 - Could be. I don't want to drop too many spoilers. 
 - I still don't see why it has to be so complicated. 
 - Well, you thought Inception was great, didn't you? All those layers? 
 - Yeah... 
 - Okay, it's a bit like that. It really works. But you'd have trouble explaining why to someone who hadn't seen it. 
 - Mmm.

When headstrong LuLing rejects the marriage proposal of the coffinmaker, a shocking series of events are set in motion-all of which lead back to Ruth and LuLing in modern San Francisco. The truth that Ruth learns from her mother's past will forever change her perception of family, love, and forgiveness.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,16,2,14,8.375,9,3.98,997,3.0,"Like The Joy Luck Club, this book is about relationships between mothers and daughters, and the importance of knowing each other's life stories. In the first part of the book, we meet Ruth, a first generation Chinese-American working as a ghostwriter for New Age self-help books in California. She has a hard time asserting herself in her ten-year relationship with her boyfriend. Her mother, LuLing, has been recently diagnosed with dementia, and can no longer live alone. LuLing is depressed, critical, sends her daughter on guilt trips, and threatens to commit suicide whenever she is crossed. She believes in superstitions and curses, and needs to communicate with the dead when she makes important decisions. 
 The second part of the book tells the story of LuLing and the bonesetter's daughter back in China. This memoir written by LuLing, was my favorite part of the book. LuLing was part of a rural family that made high quality ink that was used in calligraphy. Both LuLing and her mother faced difficult challenges, and were never totally accepted by her father's family. In her teens, LuLing was taken in by missionaries during the Japanese occupation of China, and she later immigrated to the United States. LuLing's journal gives Ruth the knowledge to understand her mother better, and to make sense of Ruth's childhood. 
 The third part of the book is set in the present, and easy solutions are found for both LuLing's and Ruth's problems. A thread seems to tie the three generations of women together in strong, but difficult, mother-daughter relationships. 
 I had mixed feelings about this book. The first part of the book, about Ruth's problems and LuLing's negative parenting, dragged for me.

The Sun Dog",Nonfiction,Intermediate,22,1,13,3.3181818181818183,12,3.9,77840,4.0,"A re-read after more than twenty years. Will it stand up? 
 Short answer: Absolutely. :) 
 The Langoliers fits snugly in the New Weird category, pretty much entirely esoteric SF with gremlin-types, alternate dimenions and/or time travel on a plane... There are no snakes here! :) The characters are a blast and we've got a firm horror vibe going on here where we are kept guessing as to who among all these random sleepers will make it to the end. Thoroughly enjoyable novella, but not my favorite. It's probably best that it was relegated to a TV movie. :) 
 My favorite is a toss up between Secret Window, Secret Garden, and The Library Police. 
 First, though, Secret Window, Secret Garden, which only slightly resembles the movie with Johnny Depp, or at least more or less. :) 
 This one was pretty fantastic for the writing insights, the plagiarism scare, the descent into paranoia, and the general ultimate break from reality. What's better than a writer being driven completely crazy by a story and/or a man with a definite grudge over a story? No spoilers, but so many wonderful twists happen, couldn't help but fall in love all over again. 
 And then there's The Library Police, which is a wonderful twist on early childhood nightmares, a diatribe on fear, Red Licorice, and a cool twist on vampirism. It was definitely probably the most effective and convoluted of all the novellas in this book, I think, and also the most scarily fantastic, diving into some of the most weird and eerie escapades, even outdoing Secret Window, Secret Garden on several levels, but maybe not as much for the MC. 
 The last novella, The Sun Dog, is classic SK not only for setting dropping and character dropping, but also in the twist he's known for... turning everyday objects into a nightmare of continuing and evolving proportions, driving all those involved into a deeper and deeper despair and fear. :) 
 Does SK have a think about mad dogs? Even Cujo was referenced here. But the dog in the photograph has got to be even better in this novella. It's absolutely more elusive and menacing, giving up on immediate danger and far-off menace for a much more paranormal and evil menace that gave me, at least, a more pervasive and ongoing fear. 
 It also happened to be my least favorite of the bunch, but it was still effective. :) 
 The middle two were plainly amazing, though. :)",74.0,1,37368,201039.84,5.38,779,5,5,5

She's sick of her life, though. Sick of the rules of being a Parker-King. She wants something more, even if it isn't forever. Somewhere in history there was that one time where hot, no-strings-attached sex didn't end badly, right? Finding comfort in the arms of a former SEAL is easy, not falling for one . . . not so much.
Noah left the military and moved to New York for one reason: his daughter. Not for some uptight businesswoman--a Manhattan elitist. So when Grace offers him the kind of relationship that no hot-blooded man can turn down, he should say no. And when her seemingly put-together life spins out of control, and his instincts to protect and save kick in, he should turn away. But he doesn't.

 I find it hard to review these books. How do you review books that are Fantasy classics? These are books that everybody already knows are good. I find it difficult to express how great these books are. I mean besides Lord of the Rings this has to be considered the best classic Epic Fantasy right? Well I guess I will just take it book by book and see what happens. This is yet another great book in this series. What a wonderful story. Awesome characters. The worldbuilding is just fantastic. Robert Jordan deserves his reputation as the outstanding author he was. This series deserves it's place near the top of all epic fantasy. The adventures of Rand, Perrin, and Mat are truly epic. Classic fantasy at it's best. You have reluctant heroes, Dark powers, magic, diverse people, and great battles. 
 Overall another great book in the series. It has some wonderfully memorable moments. It is also is beginning to slow down a bit. I don't mind so much because I am so attached to the characters and the story, but I can see were all the complaining comes from. I am looking forward to continuing this fantastic series. 
 The only regret I have with this book, and the series is that I did not read it sooner! I can see now that I am going to be obsessed with this series. I finally know what all the hype was about from all the WoT fans out there. Now I am one of you. I wanted to read the whole series this year (As you can see I am very behind).

Only King could write a story where the narrator is so present, so 'heavy' and make it all the more fulfilling because of it. Plus Flagg, for me, is one of the best characters ever created (how I wish I could make myself 'dim'...) - he's evil, scary, believable (which is some feat, for a magician who can shoot flames from his forefinger) but most of all, he's compelling.

1563,Ender'S Shadow,Orson Scott Card,1999,1999,"Ender's Shadowis being dubbed as a parallel novel to Orson Scott Card's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Ender's Game. By ""parallel,"" Card means that Shadowbegins and ends at roughly the same time as Game, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity's fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of Shadow, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know.
Although it may seem like Shadowis merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous Ender's Game, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of Ender's Gamehinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, Shadowmanages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that Shadow, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. --Craig E. Engler",Nonfiction,Intermediate,1,15,15,15.0,2,4.3,1211,3.0,"Originally posted on SpecFic Junkie. 
 I remember being excited as a kid when I saw this in the ""New"" section at one of the University of Texas libraries. I remember my mother and I thinking it was pretty decent. And that's the feeling I get from it now. It's okay, but doesn't stand up to the later Ender books, like Speaker for the Dead or Xenocide. It also deals with religion very differently, which isn't surprising to me. 
 The whole point of the Ender's Shadow series is that Orson Scott Card realized there was a lot more story to tell, especially considering the rather large time jump between Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. Originally, he'd planned to let another author pen the series, but as he delved into the idea, he fell in love with it too much to give away. 
 Ender's Shadow follows the story of Bean, one of the children that was part of Ender's Dragon army. The story starts with Bean's early childhood as a starving street kid. We learn that he's incredibly smart, both in intelligence and street smarts, which we see through him saving a crew of kids on the street (partially to save himself) and when he gets taken under the wing of a nun who wants to educate him. 
 When he's on the street, Bean comes across his own Peter. He convinces Poke, the leader of the crew, that in order to survive, they need protection from one of the ""bullies."" When they take down Achilles, Bean sees that the best end for all of them is to kill Achilles to make a statement. He's too dangerous alive. 
 Instead, Poke shows mercy, and pretty much takes over the crew, turning them into his ""family."" But when another bully who was brought down by Achilles in the line for the soup kitchen is released from the hospital, Achilles tells everyone he must flee. Bean leaves and sees Achilles kiss, then kill, Poke. He then realizes that Achilles plans to pit the murder on Ulysses, the other bully, in order to better sway the street kids to his favor. 
 Bean also realizes that he will never be safe from Achilles. 
 When Bean eventually gets into Battle School, he's treated like Ender was originally. Unfortunately, coming after Ender, he's also constantly compared to him. So what Bean has to do is separate himself from Ender, to prove that he's his own man. He uses a lot more subterfuge than Ender to make this point, creating a teacher account to go into those records and crawling around in the vents. 
 In the end, we find out that Bean is somewhat the mastermind behind choosing the members of Dragon Army, and so in many ways, the success to that experiment. 
 All-in-all, the plot is kind of fun if you were invested in Ender's Game more than the later books and is clearly written for that audience. Nothing is really that subtle or profound. There are no real moral statements to be made, beyond the obvious. Obviously Bean comes in contact with Achilles again and bests him. Obviously Bean is shown to have great potential. None of this is shocking or really tells us that much beyond the plot of the story. 
 What was kind of surprising to me is the way religion is treated in the story. Almost all of Orson Scott Card's books have somewhat flirted with religion. Ender's Game had the least of it, actually, even though the reason Ender exists is because his father was a Catholic and was looking for an excuse to have a third child. Speaker for the Dead dealt heavily with religion and religious morality with the Catholic nature of the colony and the idea of bringing religion to the uneducated aliens. Xenocide and Children of the Mind both dealt with religion as well, though in a heavily negative light. 
 In Ender's Shadow, though, religion is shown to be flawed as an institution (the nun in the story doesn't think she'll be taken back by her sisters after her work) but beautiful and profound to the individual. The religious morality isn't a hit over the head, but it certainly is more constant, albeit downplayed, throughout the entire work. 
 It's not uncommon for the Mormon church to push successful authors to show more religious viewpoints in their works over time. I almost wonder if that's what's happening to Orson Scott Card. While he was overtly religious in some of his other works (re-writing the Book of Mormon as scifi, anyone?) the Ender series was his bread-and-butter, and didn't really examine religion in a positive light. 
 Mostly, I found Ender's Shadow to be a fun, but simplistic read. After reading it, I don't expect to get much out of the other novels. However, considering Ender's Game was a completely different read than the later books, maybe they'll up in complexity over time.",2.0,1,416,411.84,0.99,250,3,1,3

On the death of her master, Letta is suddenly promoted to Wordsmith, charged with collecting and saving words.

This just felt like a mashup of a lot of classic dystopian novels rolled up into one, but it never really got close to the level of any of the books it was trying to be. A little bit of The Giver with some Fahrenheit 451 maybe some 1984 and then some elements of any other dystopian novel. This just never took off for me for some reason. 
 I was definitely drawn to the idea of the book and the world it described. The thought of a world controlled by language and what words must be used was interesting, but it played out more ridiculous on the book. I think the concept is good, just not enough there to make me care. Even at the beginning when the first bit of intrigue occurs and Marlo shows up unexpectedly and you're trying to figure out who he is and all that... I was just bored. 
 Hey, and it was cool how things sort of mirror our own world. The story of Noah's Ark is there, I mean with the same name and all, and there is this rebuilding and starting a new world after crazy events. That was cool. Like I said, there was some good stuff here that just needed someone to come along and breathe more life into it. I would go through an entire chapter sometimes and find my mind wandering off, and then I would snap back into it and realize I hadn't missed much. 
 So if dystopian is your thing, gives this a shot later this year. I've found plenty of great reviews out there. I just love the books it draws inspiration from, but felt this one didn't come anywhere close to being what it could have been. Oh, and the fact that you only get 500 words to use is a cool idea, but whew boy is it hard to read. It just got kind of silly. That's all.

At first, Lo's stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for--and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo's desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong...

 When I first started the book last night, I couldn't put it down. I wanted to get to the ship and see what was going on. Then once we were on there, I wanted to keep going but sleep took me away. 
 The beginning of the story was bleh for me because I just wanted to get to the boat and I didn't see any reason for that beginning. Then when you're on the boat and the beginning is used against the main character, Lo Blacklock, I began to understand. 
 Lo is a travel journalist and is finally getting to go on a trip because her boss is preggers. Unfortunately for her, she sees a body get thrown off the boat, no one believes her, she has no proof and when she does get proof, it gets removed. She wonders if she's crazy or what. 
 I just wanted to get to the end to see what in the world was going on and who did what, when and how. I certainly didn't think it was actually what happened. Then throughout the book there were reports of Lo Blacklock's death and they found a body and I was like, ""What?"" 
 It's all crazy train, er, crazy boat, but I did enjoy it. Unfortunately, I didn't love it near enough to buy the book with the awesome cover. Or did I?

Soon the king's oldest son, Peter is imprisoned at the top of a high tower, the Needle, for his father's murder, while his younger brother Thomas inherits the throne.
Only Peter knows the truth of his own innocence, and the truth of the evil that is Flagg. And only Peter can save Delain from the horror Flagg has in store. He has a plan, but it is dangerous and desperate and if he fails there will be no second chance.

Plus Flagg, for me, is one of the best characters ever created (how I wish I could make myself 'dim'...) - he's evil, scary, believable (which is some feat, for a magician who can shoot flames from his forefinger) but most of all, he's compelling.

Years of simmering tensions finally reach a breaking point on an unseasonably cold afternoon in New York City as Melody, Beatrice, and Jack Plumb gather to confront their charismatic and reckless older brother, Leo, freshly released from rehab. Months earlier, an inebriated Leo got behind the wheel of a car with a nineteen-year-old waitress as his passenger.

Melody, a wife and mother in an upscale suburb, has an unwieldy mortgage and looming college tuition for her twin teenage daughters. Jack, an antiques dealer, has secretly borrowed against the beach cottage he shares with his husband, Walker, to keep his store open.

I'd spent the previous couple of months looking up suicides on the Internet, just out of curiosity. And nearly every single time, the coroner says the same thing: ""He took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed.""

When Elspeth Noblin dies of cancer, she leaves her London apartment to her twin nieces, Julia and Valentina. These two American girls never met their English aunt, only knew that their mother, too, was a twin, and Elspeth her sister. Julia and Valentina are semi-normal American teenagers--with seemingly little interest in college, finding jobs, or anything outside their cozy home in the suburbs of Chicago, and with an abnormally intense attachment to one another.
The girls move to Elspeth's flat, which borders Highgate Cemetery in London. They come to know the building's other residents. There is Martin, a brilliant and charming crossword puzzle setter suffering from crippling Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; Marjike, Martin's devoted but trapped wife; and Robert, Elspeth's elusive lover, a scholar of the cemetery. As the girls become embroiled in the fraying lives of their aunt's neighbors, they also discover that much is still alive in Highgate, including--perhaps--their aunt, who can't seem to leave her old apartment and life behind.

At midnight, one of them clapped sarcastically, and a couple of others laughed, and that was it-Happy New Year to you, too. You could have turned up to that party as the happiest person in London, and you'd still have wanted to jump off the roof by five past twelve. And I wasn't the happiest person in London anyway. Obviously.

New Year's Eve was a night for sentimental losers. It was my own stupid fault. Of course there'd be a low-rent crowd up there.

When Elspeth Noblin dies of cancer, she leaves her London apartment to her twin nieces, Julia and Valentina. These two American girls never met their English aunt, only knew that their mother, too, was a twin, and Elspeth her sister. Julia and Valentina are semi-normal American teenagers--with seemingly little interest in college, finding jobs, or anything outside their cozy home in the suburbs of Chicago, and with an abnormally intense attachment to one another.
The girls move to Elspeth's flat, which borders Highgate Cemetery in London. They come to know the building's other residents. There is Martin, a brilliant and charming crossword puzzle setter suffering from crippling Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; Marjike, Martin's devoted but trapped wife; and Robert, Elspeth's elusive lover, a scholar of the cemetery. As the girls become embroiled in the fraying lives of their aunt's neighbors, they also discover that much is still alive in Highgate, including--perhaps--their aunt, who can't seem to leave her old apartment and life behind.

Every family has its problems. But even among the most troubled, the Plumb family stands out as spectacularly dysfunctional. Years of simmering tensions finally reach a breaking point on an unseasonably cold afternoon in New York City as Melody, Beatrice, and Jack Plumb gather to confront their charismatic and reckless older brother, Leo, freshly released from rehab. Months earlier, an inebriated Leo got behind the wheel of a car with a nineteen-year-old waitress as his passenger. The ensuing accident has endangered the Plumbs joint trust fund, ""The Nest,"" which they are months away from finally receiving. Meant by their deceased father to be a modest mid-life supplement, the Plumb siblings have watched The Nest's value soar along with the stock market and have been counting on the money to solve a number of self-inflicted problems.
Melody, a wife and mother in an upscale suburb, has an unwieldy mortgage and looming college tuition for her twin teenage daughters. Jack, an antiques dealer, has secretly borrowed against the beach cottage he shares with his husband, Walker, to keep his store open. And Bea, a once-promising short-story writer, just can't seem to finish her overdue novel. Can Leo rescue his siblings and, by extension, the people they love? Or will everyone need to reimagine the future they've envisioned? Brought together as never before, Leo, Melody, Jack, and Beatrice must grapple with old resentments, present-day truths, and the significant emotional and financial toll of the accident, as well as finally acknowledge the choices they have made in their own lives.

 Newest pet peeve: When the marketing department in a publishing house decides it would be a great idea to promote just about any new psychological thriller as ""The NEW Gone Girl"" to sell the hell out of it. This seems unfair to me. If a person loved Gone Girl-they could be disappointed, and if they hated Gone Girl-they might not give it a chance. 
 I loved Gone Girl! I loved THE SILENT WIFE! THE SILENT WIFE is NOT Gone Girl. Yes, there are a few similarities. A toxic marriage, husband and wife narrators, and unlikable (for most readers) main characters, but to me this is where the similarities end. 
 Setting: 
 Chicago in Autumn. 
 The Players: 
 ""Him"" Todd (the husband) -A despicable man in his mid-40s, a perpetual cheater who has zero self-awareness, and uses his childhood traumas as an excuse to do whatever he pleases no matter who it hurts. (the typical 40 year old man really).....kidding. 
 ""Her"" Jodi (the wife) -A non-confrontational part-time psychologist, part-time Martha Stewart-esque housewife-who because of childhood trauma, has learned to bury anything unpleasant so deep that it is like it never happened. 
 The Plot: 
 After 20 years in a ""common law marriage"" Todd knocks up his best friends daughter and decides to leave Jodi completely penniless. Jodi decides Todd should die. 
 As usual I read quite a few reviews before writing mine, and as usual I am going to disagree with a lot of them. Cause that's how I roooollllll......or maybe it is because I have no idea what I am talking about. I just don't get why some reviewers have to like the people they are reading about, to like a book. Did you like Betty Jane Hudson or Blanche in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? How about Reality T.V's Richard Hatch on Survivor, some of you I am sure watched..and loved to hate. So what is so different about fiction novels? I adore books with flawed characters! I loved to hate Todd in THE SILENT WIFE. I loved every shake of my head when I read his thoughts, and every time I caught myself rolling my eyes at his stupidity. He was real. I hated that he was real, but sadly enough I have met more men like him than I care to mention, and I loved Jodi! I sympathized with Jodi. It was completely believable to me that she would turn out to be exactly as she is because of her past and regardless of her profession (I am the daughter of a psychiatrist-and believe me speaking from experience, they don't say psychiatrists have the craziest families for no reason.) 
 This is a wonderful debut fiction novel from Susan Harrison, and I was very sad to read- in an article about her death in April/2013- that it will also be her last.",339.0,1,28728,194201.28,6.76,897,5,2,4

Meet Martin, JJ, Jess, and Maureen. Four people who come together on New Year's Eve: a former TV talk show host, a musician, a teenage girl, and a mother. Three are British, one is American. They encounter one another on the roof of Topper's House, a London destination famous as the last stop for those ready to end their lives.
In four distinct and riveting first-person voices, Nick Hornby tells a story of four individuals confronting the limits of choice, circumstance, and their own mortality. This is a tale of connections made and missed, punishing regrets, and the grace of second chances.
Intense, hilarious, provocative, and moving, A Long Way Downis a novel about suicide that is, surprisingly, full of life.

Maureen
Why is it the biggest sin of all? All your life you're told that you'll be going to this marvelous place when you pass on. And the one thing you can do to get you there a bit quicker is something that stops you getting there at all. Oh, I can see that it's a kind of queue-jumping. But if someone jumps the queue at the post office, people tut. Or sometimes they say ""Excuse me, I was here first."" They don't say ""You will be consumed by hellfire for all eternity."" That would be a bit strong.
Martin
I'd spent the previous couple of months looking up suicides on the Internet, just out of curiosity. And nearly every single time, the coroner says the same thing: ""He took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed."" And then you read the story about the poor bastard: His wife was sleeping with his best friend, he'd lost his job, his daughter had been killed in a road accident some months before . . . Hello, Mr. Coroner? I'm sorry, but there's no disturbed mental balance here, my friend. I'd say he got it just right.

And when you feel a bit down in the dumps sometimes you need something relatable and so I gave this a go. 
 Do you know that feeling when you're stuck in a long bus ride with friends or you stay over at a close friend's house and you talk about meaningful things all night? That's the feel I kind of got from this book. The kind of feeling that shows you even smack talk can give warmth and fuck yous are really I care for yous. The story is told between four narrators at a conversational level that really sets the mood of the novel. These four people find themselves atop the same tower at New Years Eve planning to commit suicide. Unsurprisingly, they postpone, get to talking and somehow their differences in character causes their interactions to be a bit comical. It's really amazing to see how Nick Hornby is able to balance the tightrope between comical and relatable. Obviously there's something gooey that pulls you in but there's also enough humor to make you stay. 
 What I really appreciated about A Long Way Down is its heartfelt tone. It could have easily been overtly dramatic and begging but it refused to look at suicide that way. It was playful without being offensive, and had just the right amount of crankiness for something with such a sensitive topic. It also doesn't hurt that most of the characters are British, cause those people have a lot of attitude. A bizarre ball of humanity, fun, and wisdom this is. 
 This book dealt with the issues of depression and suicide in a really fascinating manner. It presented four different characters, with four different circumstances. I guess it wants to say that each person has their own story, they have their own problems, and consequently their own journeys. But what this book emphasized is togetherness and company when battling these problems. These four people didn't have anyone they can turn to, and so by some weird act of fate, they found each other. Sometimes all you need is someone to be with, not even to talk to, but just knowing that someone is there for you, that can be a big relief. The four of them drew strength from each other. Maybe that's all there is to a meaningful life: good company. 
 You know that feeling when you've been traveling a few hours with your friends and you've had too much fun talking about stuff you don't want the ride to end? Maybe life's like that. Maybe finding the right people to enjoy the ride with will make you stay. Maybe that's enough of a reason to take the long way down.",55.0,1,4440,17715.600000000002,3.99,1046,4,2,2

(I clearly seem to be of the minority here, but I'm fine with that.) I had high hopes for this one going in--another brilliantly written cover flap did the trick--but my expectations were never met, and by mid-way, I stopped hoping and assuming that they eventually would be. In fact, this one almost didn't get finished; sheer perseverance pushed me through. 
 The Nest is about the Plumb siblings, four middle-agers whose lives are thrown into tumult when the eldest, Leo, gets himself into trouble yet again--drugs, a Porsche and a pretty young thing complete the cliche--and their mother nearly depletes ""the nest,"" their trust fund, which they are all expecting to inherit soon, to get him out of this bind. His siblings, Jack, Bea, and Melody are outraged and anxiety-filled, worrying about their personal financial situations, which have escalated to the point of emergency because they assumed they'd have the nest to bail them out, and now it's nearly gone. Leo and his siblings struggle to find a way out of the mess he started, and isn't sure how to remedy, while dealing with the intricacies of their own lives. 
 The problem with The Nest is that this novel could've been written by ANYONE. I saw no extraordinary skill, no ambition, no originality, no nothing. Even the endings were all hastily done, formulaic bow ties fit for day-time TV. In short, I was not impressed. The Nest fell so flat for me that there was nearly an audible ""splat"" sound ringing in my ears throughout the entire reading process. The writing was mediocre, at times hitting on pithy narrative prose that occurred so infrequently that I have to believe they were flukes, one-offs: 
 ""Maybe she would slip Melody some cash, enough for some Botox or a facial or something to brighten her pallor. She was the youngest and somehow the most faded, as if the Plumb DNA had thinned with each conception, strong and robust with Leo and each child after being--a little less."" 
 That was one of the better lines of this novel (in addition to the 9/11 nationalism sarcasm), but unfortunately it also sums up how I felt about this one--strong and robust packaging and selling of this novel only for each chapter to impress me less and less. The characters here were so uninteresting, so unremarkable, that I could hardly keep them straight. They were all either blah, like Melody, or cliche--oh, the cliches here! 
 I can't even really fully discuss the glaring rudimentary stereotypes running rampant in this one. There was the drunken, ice queen of a matriarch who dressed in a sexy robe for her daughter's 12th birthday (one of the more interesting characters, whom we hardly saw, but the cliche smacked me in the face). Then there was Matilda Rodriguez, the naive Hispanic girl who ""called everyone Mami or Papi"" despite their age--cliche, yawn--and Simone, the supposedly cool, urban, street smart black girl (honestly, already the shallow cliche in this novel's setting) who says, ""That's tight"" a lot. Tight? REALLY? Tight? What decade is this, please? This one was absolutely deserving of the eye-roll, that she would stake her novel on such underdeveloped outlines of overdone stereotypes (and that it would then be praised as great writing really confounded me). Then we shan't forget the cliche of the gay sibling who wanted lots of random, casual sex in sleazy nightclubs (I literally forgot his name and had to look above to write it here, Jack) who marveled at his luck at dodging AIDS (really?), and the list actually does go on. There were so many cliches thrown into this one that it was like the literary equivalent of Scary Movie. This element in and of itself revealed that Sweeney is as out of touch with the real world as her characters are, and that made the read unenjoyable--in fact, a chore. It wasn't nearly pushed far enough to be satire; this is really the world she wanted to paint, which would have been fine, possibly even funny, as a satire but nothing more than that. 
 The Nest also had too many superfluous characters and story lines! (I'm looking at you Robohook man, and the guy from the 9/11 towers--and his daughters, and his dog, and his deceased wife, oh my!) This one had the makings of a good read and it even had a few glimmers of entertainment value (but they weren't nearly enough to up the number of stars). This novel wasn't even really ABOUT ""the nest."" It stopped even being about that about 1/3 of the way through, and I nearly forgot what the commotion of the plot line was all about in the first place. 
 If you want to read about WASPy yacht problems (1st world problems that no one cares about other than the self-absorbed people experiencing them), endless whining about not receiving a large, undeserved amount of money, and story lines that suffered because of the sheer number of them squeezed in here, you've come to the right place. I definitely would not recommend this novel to anyone who would even remotely consider themselves a Millennial (whether by age or by temperament). I started to give this one 2 stars, because I finished it, but then realized that that was my own accomplishment, not this novel's. 1 star. *

1589,Her Fearful Symmetry,Audrey Niffenegger,2009,2009,"Six years after the phenomenal success of The Time Traveler's Wife, Audrey Niffenegger has returned with a spectacularly compelling and haunting second novel set in and around Highgate Cemetery in London.
When Elspeth Noblin dies of cancer, she leaves her London apartment to her twin nieces, Julia and Valentina. These two American girls never met their English aunt, only knew that their mother, too, was a twin, and Elspeth her sister. Julia and Valentina are semi-normal American teenagers--with seemingly little interest in college, finding jobs, or anything outside their cozy home in the suburbs of Chicago, and with an abnormally intense attachment to one another.
The girls move to Elspeth's flat, which borders Highgate Cemetery in London. They come to know the building's other residents. There is Martin, a brilliant and charming crossword puzzle setter suffering from crippling Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; Marjike, Martin's devoted but trapped wife; and Robert, Elspeth's elusive lover, a scholar of the cemetery. As the girls become embroiled in the fraying lives of their aunt's neighbors, they also discover that much is still alive in Highgate, including--perhaps--their aunt, who can't seem to leave her old apartment and life behind.
Niffenegger weaves a captivating story in Her Fearful Symmetry about love and identity, about secrets and sisterhood, and about the tenacity of life--even after death.",Nonfiction,Novice,3,6,14,10.0,9,3.24,64364,5.0,"This was difficult to put down but I deliberately tried to read slowly beause it was such a pleasure to read. Niffenegger is one of the finest contemporary writers and noone does longing and stymied love better than she does. 
 This book reminded me of ""Time Traveler's Wife"" as well as ""The Lovely Bones."" The stories center on an apartment building right off of Highgate Cemetery in London. One apartment belongs to Elspeth Noblin who dies on the first page of the book and bequeaths the apartment to her twin nieces in America, with the stipulation that they must live there for a year before selling and that their mother, Elspeth's own twin, can never set foot in the apartment. The top floor apartment is occupied by Martin, who suffers terribley from OCD. Niffenegger's rendering of OCD is the most painful and seemingly realistic depiction that I've come across. Elspeth's somewhat younger lover lives in the first floor apartment and works as a tour guide at Highgate Cemetery.

He is a committed cheater. She lives and breathes denial. He exists in dual worlds. She likes to settle scores. He decides to play for keeps. She has nothing left to lose. Told in alternating voices, The Silent Wife is about a marriage in the throes of dissolution, a couple headed for catastrophe, concessions that can't be made, and promises that won't be kept.

Generous-hearted and wickedly insightful, The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishingmaps the progress of Jane Rosenal as she sets out on a personal and spirited expedition through the perilous terrain of sex, love, and relationships as well as the treacherous waters of the workplace.

 Her characters proceed with humor, but it is not cheeky or plucky. If her characters were brought to life on tv, it would be a drama, not a comedy. 
 Like my favorite short story collection of all time, The Nick Adams Stories, the protagonist, Jane Rosenal observes the world as a teenager through her early adulthood.

1593,The Nest,Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney,2016,2016,"A warm, funny and acutely perceptive debut novel about four adult siblings and the fate of the shared inheritance that has shaped their choices and their lives.
Every family has its problems. But even among the most troubled, the Plumb family stands out as spectacularly dysfunctional. Years of simmering tensions finally reach a breaking point on an unseasonably cold afternoon in New York City as Melody, Beatrice, and Jack Plumb gather to confront their charismatic and reckless older brother, Leo, freshly released from rehab. Months earlier, an inebriated Leo got behind the wheel of a car with a nineteen-year-old waitress as his passenger. The ensuing accident has endangered the Plumbs joint trust fund, ""The Nest,"" which they are months away from finally receiving. Meant by their deceased father to be a modest mid-life supplement, the Plumb siblings have watched The Nest's value soar along with the stock market and have been counting on the money to solve a number of self-inflicted problems.
Melody, a wife and mother in an upscale suburb, has an unwieldy mortgage and looming college tuition for her twin teenage daughters. Jack, an antiques dealer, has secretly borrowed against the beach cottage he shares with his husband, Walker, to keep his store open. And Bea, a once-promising short-story writer, just can't seem to finish her overdue novel. Can Leo rescue his siblings and, by extension, the people they love? Or will everyone need to reimagine the future they've envisioned? Brought together as never before, Leo, Melody, Jack, and Beatrice must grapple with old resentments, present-day truths, and the significant emotional and financial toll of the accident, as well as finally acknowledge the choices they have made in their own lives.

(He died on July 31st, 2012 at the age of 86.) The triumphant arc of Vidal's literary career wasn't solely a mastery of language, though that never hurts. Handsome, poised, slim, charismatic, able to hold his own in verbal fisticuffs without losing his imperious cool, Vidal was the premiere star author of his generation, the one who elevated the role of talk-show guest to a command performance--a theatrical event. He brought the electronic crackle of the TV screen to his prose and the tactical precision of his prose to combat debate on TV. His near-violent altercations on camera with William F.

 William Halleck is a successful lawyer living in upper middle class splendor in a Connecticut suburb with his wife and daughter, and his biggest problem is that he's overweight. His perfect life is upset when he accidently run over an old Gypsy woman when he was *ahem* distracted behind the wheel. Since Billy is one of the solid taxpayers who plays golf with all the right people the whole mess is quickly tidied up in court without him getting so much as a ticket. However, another old Gypsy puts a whammy on him and suddenly Billy can't keep weight on no matter how much he eats. As he becomes a shadow of his former self Billy sets out on a desperate quest to track down the Gypsy and try to convince him to lift the curse of growing thinner. 
 This was the last of the novels Stephen King released under the pen name of Richard Bachman before his cover was blown shortly after its publication. (In fact, he gets cute by having a couple of characters describe the situation as sounding like a King novel.) As with the other Bachman books it seems like Uncle Stevie ran leaner and meaner in this one. He keeps the story focused tightly on its key concept, but he's also delivering some nice subtext about American culture. We've got a nicely ironic curse of a man's thoughtless greedy consumption being turned back on him as well as exploring the hypocritical way that the decent folk of New England will have their fun with the Gypsies and then run them out of town. 
 One of the strongest points here is in Halleck as a character. Billy seems like a decent guy who genuinely feels guilty about the death he inadvertently caused, and he's got the brains and courage to face up to the bizarre situation and act to save himself. However, he also went along with sweeping the whole mess under the rug, and he's willing to turn to a dangerous friend when he's really in trouble. So there's a nice mix in him that he's both somewhat willing to take responsibility even as he trying to wriggle out of the consequences of it.

It follows Moon two years after his suspension from duty for not following house rules; he is back on the scene but still has a nagging feeling that his superiors are out to get him.
The story starts with the discovery of a body hidden under a pile of leaves in the middle of a wood. This sets Moon off on an investigation that will prove to be full of surprises. The body belongs to a small-time criminal named Sean Mattox who has been shot at close range with a shotgun. Nothing, however, links Mattox to the place where his body is found. and with the forensic evidence thin on the ground, Moon quickly finds himself confronted by one dead end after the other.
Aided once again by his journalist friend, Jo Lyon, Moon uncovers a trail which eventually leads to a case of sex abuse and then to a missing person. At first nothing seems to connect the strange goings-on up lonely country lanes until Moon starts to make a startling series of discoveries. Can he solve the mystery of who killed Sean Mattox?

In a remote mountain village where ghosts and tradition rule, LuLing grows up in the care of her mute Precious Auntie as the family endures a curse laid upon a relative known as the bonesetter. When headstrong LuLing rejects the marriage proposal of the coffinmaker, a shocking series of events are set in motion-all of which lead back to Ruth and LuLing in modern San Francisco.

In the first part of the book, we meet Ruth, a first generation Chinese-American working as a ghostwriter for New Age self-help books in California. She has a hard time asserting herself in her ten-year relationship with her boyfriend. Her mother, LuLing, has been recently diagnosed with dementia, and can no longer live alone. LuLing is depressed, critical, sends her daughter on guilt trips, and threatens to commit suicide whenever she is crossed. She believes in superstitions and curses, and needs to communicate with the dead when she makes important decisions. 
 The second part of the book tells the story of LuLing and the bonesetter's daughter back in China. This memoir written by LuLing, was my favorite part of the book. LuLing was part of a rural family that made high quality ink that was used in calligraphy. Both LuLing and her mother faced difficult challenges, and were never totally accepted by her father's family. In her teens, LuLing was taken in by missionaries during the Japanese occupation of China, and she later immigrated to the United States. LuLing's journal gives Ruth the knowledge to understand her mother better, and to make sense of Ruth's childhood. 
 The third part of the book is set in the present, and easy solutions are found for both LuLing's and Ruth's problems. A thread seems to tie the three generations of women together in strong, but difficult, mother-daughter relationships. 
 I had mixed feelings about this book. The first part of the book, about Ruth's problems and LuLing's negative parenting, dragged for me. The second part, set in China, was exciting with wonderful characters--the bonesetter grandfather, the wicked relatives, LuLing's first love, the suicidal nursemaid. The short third part brought things together well, but seemed to promise an almost too rosy future.",9.0,1,266,263.34,0.99,340,1,3,2

I never could have expected a story so involving and complex. The characters come to life on the pages, and the storyline is brilliant in its everyday commonness. 
 Summer Sisters follows the lives of Caitlyn Somers and Victoria Leonard, two unlikely girls from different social backgrounds. Caitlin invites Victoria to stay the summer with her and her father who lives in Martha's Vineyard; shy Victoria can't imagine why a girl so glamorous as Caitlin would want to be friend someone as boring as herself. The two of them form a complex friendship of love and rivalry that spans from the 1970s to the 1990s. 
 These girls share moments of soaring loyalty and heartbreaking betrayal, and I was glued from the very first page. The settings are so real, part of them I could have plucked from my own childhood.

When Elspeth Noblin dies of cancer, she leaves her London apartment to her twin nieces, Julia and Valentina. These two American girls never met their English aunt, only knew that their mother, too, was a twin, and Elspeth her sister. Julia and Valentina are semi-normal American teenagers--with seemingly little interest in college, finding jobs, or anything outside their cozy home in the suburbs of Chicago, and with an abnormally intense attachment to one another.

1615,First Sight,Danielle Steel,2013,2013,"NEW YORK TIMESBESTSELLER
Paris, L.A., and the world of ready to wear fashion provide rich backdrops for Danielle Steel's deeply involving story of a gifted designer whose talent and drive have brought her everything--except the ability to erase her past and trust relationships.
FIRST SIGHT 
New York. London. Milan. Paris. Fashion Week in all four cities. A month of endless interviews, parties, and unflagging work and attention to detail at the semiannual ready to wear fashion shows--the famous pret-a-porter. At the center of the storm and avalanche of work is American Timmie O'Neill, whose renowned line, Timmie O, is the embodiment of casual chic, in fashion and for the home. She has created a business that inspires, fills, and consumes her life.
With an unerring instinct for what the next trend will be, an innate genius for business, tireless labor, and sheer fearlessness, starting from nothing, over two decades Timmie has built an international empire that has brought her enormous satisfaction and success. In a world where humility and compassion are all too rare, her humor, kindness, integrity, and creativity are inspirational. Yet as blessed as she feels by her success, Timmie harbors the private wounds of a devastating childhood and past tragedy. She is too smart, too experienced, and too hurt to want much in her personal life beyond a succession of convenient, very limited relationships. Always willing to take risks in business, she never risks her heart.
But despite her well-ordered and highly controlled world, it turns out that Timmie O'Neill is not immune to magic when it strikes. And it strikes in Paris during Paris Fashion Week, when an intriguing Frenchman comes into her life when she gets sick. At first, Timmie and Jean-Charles Vernier are only patient and physician. They become confidants and friends, corresponding at a safe distance between Paris and Los Angeles once she goes home. There is every reason why they must remain apart. But neither can deny their growing friendship and the electricity that sparks whenever they meet.
First Sightis as complex and compelling as modern life itself. Careers, families, histories, losses, duty, obligation, and fear of losing control and getting hurt. It is a tale of daring to take risks, and losing control just enough to have a life, when the opportunity presents itself. When two very different worlds and strong-willed people collide, everything changes in an instant, as they confront the age-old question of whether to lay oneself bare and risk intimacy--or not.

And will they do it together or apart?",Fiction,Intermediate,5,4,14,9.8,11,3.49,13,5.0,"it was a very good book as always, her book always have a story that some can relate to.

1622,The Round House,Louise Erdrich,2012,2012,"An exquisitely told story of a boy on the cusp of manhood who seeks justice and understanding in the wake of a terrible crime that upends and forever transforms his family.
One of the most revered novelists of our time - a brilliant chronicler of Native-American life - Louise Erdrich returns to the territory of her bestselling, Pulitzer Prize finalist The Plague of Doves with The Round House, transporting readers to the Ojibwe reservation in North Dakota. It is an exquisitely told story of a boy on the cusp of manhood who seeks justice and understanding in the wake of a terrible crime that upends and forever transforms his family.
Riveting and suspenseful, arguably the most accessible novel to date from the creator of Love Medicine, The Beet Queen, and The Bingo Palace, Erdrich's The Round House is a page-turning masterpiece of literary fiction - at once a powerful coming-of-age story, a mystery, and a tender, moving novel of family, history, and culture.",Fiction,Intermediate,12,12,16,14.25,14,3.91,69142,5.0,"The Round House is a knockout of a book. 
 Louise Erdrich is one of the true deities in America's literary Olympus. With The Round House she has used her mythic creative powers to give us a book that can be read as a page-turner about a terrible crime, the attempt to identify the criminal and take action, or as a rich, layered look at a culture in a place and time, and a lad coming of age within it, the tale imbued with telling details, a colorful palette of imagery and cultural significance. Or best of all, both. 
 The story opens with a father and son trying to remove invasive tree roots from the foundation of their home. This being Erdrich, you can figure that roots of one sort and another will figure in the story. Antone Bazil Coutts, known as Joe, is thirteen years old. His father, also Antone Bazil, is a judge with great reverence for the law. When Joe's mother, Geraldine Coutts, is brutally beaten and raped she retreats into the security of solitude, not only to allow herself time to heal, but to try to protect her family, and others as well. The thrust of the story is the puzzle of who and why. Erdrich drops clues along the way like a seasoned writer of detective fiction. 
 How we understand the world is informed by the stories we are told, the culture in which we are raised. Christians are raised on stories of magical abundance from a few loaves and fishes, reincarnation, angels, a sometimes communicative if often cranky, creator. A colorful local priest offers Christian teaching. Many of the Ojibwe we meet here have friends or relations who are believers. 
 The Ojibwe have their legends too. Erdrich shows this by imbuing her tale with magical realism. Native lore is both told in stories and shown as living reality. This is a world in which the shadow of a passing crane becomes an angel on a bedroom wall, a world in which a twin feels the presence of a doppelganger, of her separated other, and in which the evil spirit, a wendiigoo, in a dark man seeks to devour the spirits of others. Ghosts figure in the story. Joe sees one. His father reports having seen ghosts as well. Mooshum, Joe's beloved grandfather, explains something about ghosts to Joe. Other characters as well report seeing ghosts or having their own other-worldly experiences. We see the Ojibwe affiliating with and being protected by various animals. Joe seeks guidance by visiting his clan totem, herons. Another tale is told of an Ojibwe being saved by a turtle. And an old bison communicates with one young brave in a legend. In addition family names include Larks and Coutts, and a town physician is Doctor Egge. I won't ask which came first. 
 We see the events in Hoopdance, North Dakota, through Joe's eyes. Joe has a group of pals, most importantly his studly bff, Cappy. They see things through a more contemporary lens, Star Trek: The New Generation (TNG), the series having begun less than a year prior. The boys' use of TNG stories, lore in this context, offers them meaningful language with which to define elements of their world. Of particular interest is the episode called 
 Skin of Evil 
 . Don't check it out until you are reading the book. The relevance will be immediately obvious. The boys' banter and relationships give the feel of a Stephen King story, one of those in which he particularly shines at portraying young people. Together with Native beliefs and Christian teaching, we have an unusual trinity of primary interpretive influences. 
 What is the Round House? We learn it's history and generation from Mooshum. It is a meeting place and is supposed to be a safe haven, a building the Ojibwe, one in particular, were told to construct by a spirit. Religious ceremonies, among other events, take place there. And yet it has been violated, just as tree roots attempted to insert themselves in the foundation of Joe's house. We learn the story of the building's genesis, see it in benign contemporary use, and see it again, under less than benign circumstances. It is also situated in a location near where sundry jurisdictions intersect, Ojibwe, state, federal, the perplexity of which figures in the tale. 
 There is a cornucopia of riches in Erdrich's construction. Joe's father's respect for the law is almost religious, and is mirrored by the knowledge of and contempt for the law expressed by the baddie. Native lore is compared to that of classic Greece. There are plentiful references made here that inform the story. Classics like the Iliad, Shakespeare, Plato and more recently, Dune, which resonates, with a young man taking on adult responsibilities. Bazil refers to his Handbook of Federal Indian Law as his bible. This compares with the priest and his actual Bible and Mooshum, Joe's grandfather, with his oral history and tribal spiritual beliefs. Is Bazil's belief in the law any more magical than Father Travis's belief in an eternal creator? Is Father Travis's belief in a resurrected savior any more out there than believing that one can communicate with an elderly bison? 
 Clothing is used to great effect as well. When one key character is in the hospital, two relations don his clothing as a way of feeling close to him. A woman with a dicey past is shown to full effect by the costume she dons. After an infection of the spirit, a woman says that some Ojibwe women ""dressed me in a new ribbon dress they made. I started healing and felt even better."" And the counterpart, nakedness, is also revelatory. 
 Hiding away permeates, from Geraldine hiding in her home and inside herself, to Nanabush, a character in a story, hiding inside the carcass of a dead bison, to the genesis of the Round House as a physical manifestation of the bison's carcass, a safe place, a hideaway. 
 Erdrich's work is imbued, not only with Native American characters, but with a look at Native reality on the ground, the buildings, the legal challenges, the extended family relations, in addition her use of magical realism. We are told of Native encounters with bison, turtles and cranes. We are also shown how Native people have been treated by the American legal system. That Joe's father has such long-term faith in the merits of the law is impressive, maybe inspirational and possibly sad. 
 Her compelling story carries us along at a nice pace. We get to enjoy interesting travel companions on this journey, people we want to spend time with, particularly Joe, and while we are getting from here to there, (maybe on a shuttle craft?) we are treated to a fascinating look at things we might not have seen before, ideas we might not have encountered, history we might not have known. 
 If you have read Erdrich before you know how good she is. If you have not read her before you are in for a treat. So if you get the urge to dash out and pick up a copy of The Round House all I can advise is make it so. You will definitely engage. 
 PS - In case, for some reason, you do not want to jump to the provided link, here is a very spoilerish bit on the TNG episode noted above. Skin of Evil is a Star Trek: New Generation story the boys refer to. In it a powerful, blob-like creature, torments several of the Enterprise crew, even killing one. An element of this being is that it feels terribly lonely, abandoned by its own kind. Here, Linden, our psycho killer, is the one who truly feels empty, which is ironic since he was the twin who was kept. His damaged sibling, Linda, has felt his presence all her life, and experiences emptiness, but never turned to such darkness. In the TNG episode, Armus, the baddy, was acting out of a feeling of abandonment. (Linden = wiindigoo = Armus) The twist here is that the child who was literally abandoned turned out to be a good person, while the one who was kept became a monster.

1623,The Exorcist,William Peter Blatty,1971,1994,"Four decades after it first shook the nation, then the world, William Peter Blatty's thrilling masterwork of faith and demonic possession returns in an even more powerful form. Raw and profane, shocking and blood-chilling, it remains a modern parable of good and evil and perhaps the most terrifying novel ever written.",Fiction,Intermediate,55,1,10,3.5636363636363635,16,4.14,128301,5.0,"Because I basically now only read books for research material for my writing projects, and doing reviews on them would be BORING... I decided to post some thoughts on books that influenced my life. When I say ""influenced"" it could be profound... or even a book that I enjoyed so much that I it became a marker for a particular type of genre of entertainment that I have since enjoyed all my life. 
 I'd like to share a few thoughts on the book ""The Exorcist."" 
 The novel is a big influence on me, both professionally and personally. The book was a huge sensation when it was first published and then a few years later it was made into a famous motion picture that changed Hollywood forever. Most people have only seen the film and not read the novel. That may not be as true with people who are my age because at the time of its initial release, it was the book to read. 
 The novel was written around 1969 by William Peter Blatty and published in 1971. And though the author has claimed otherwise, the book was immediately a hit. Excuse me while I run through the plot in a few brief sentences. If you don't know the story of this book via the famous film, then your biggest worry is more along the lines of someone discovering where you've landed your flying saucer. 
 A Washington D.C. teenager, Regan MacNeil, becomes possessed by a demon and her mother eventually turns to a young priest, Father Karris, to perform an exorcism. The young priest is not experienced in such matters so he brings in an older priest, Father Merrin, to perform the rites of expulsion. The confrontation between good and evil climaxes with the demon being excised from Regan but at a cost to the living. 
 According to Wikipedia - ""It was inspired by a 1949 case of demonic possession and exorcism that Blatty heard about while he was a student in the class of 1950 at Georgetown University, a Jesuit school."" 
 Neither I nor my friends knew any of the above when we got a hold of the novel in paperback. By this time the year was 1973. I was 13 years old, going to junior high school, and the book for a few weeks was a major distraction in our lives. I distinctly remember the day I first read the illicit passages from the novel. The paperback was being passed around class while the teacher was obliviously giving his lesson on... whatever. When the book finally was handed to me, it looked like some sacred holy book -- dog eared, marked up, and otherwise showing all the signs of having been through the sweaty fingers of hundreds of the devoted. 
 ""Just read the underlined parts."" That was the mantra being said as it was slipped underneath chairs or buried in the middle of a text book as it made its way around the room from student to student. 
 The ""underlined parts"" were like nothing I had ever read before... heard anyone talk about before... even imagined before! It had a young girl saying filthy things, doing awful things... and some of those nasty things were sexual... and religious... combined! I mean a cross jammed into her private parts while saying obscene things about Jesus Christ!!!!! 
 I think I got about only half way through the underlined parts before the guy sitting behind me tapped my shoulder and urged me to hand over the book. I wasn't a slow reader; it was just that there were stuff that I couldn't help reading dozens of times! I handed the book over, but a few days later I secretly obtained my own copy of the novel. 
 I read ""The Exorcist"" from cover to cover in a day and then read it again. This was the beginning of a long affair with the book. And it had nothing to do with the salacious stuff. Okay, well maybe a little... but the nasty bits isn't why I have read the book nearly a half dozen times since. 
 The fascination with the writing is because of Blatty's ambitious attempt to grabble with the concepts of good vs. evil within the context of a commercial thriller. Indeed, his thoughtful philosophical probing would just a few years later seem ridiculously quaint and redundant when other imitators in the genre jettisoned that aspect of the novel in their own attempts to follow up the commercial success of Blatty's book. When Blatty wrote the book he was a successful Hollywood screenwriter who would take off time from working on scripts for serious writing - novels. For him, the deeper exploration of religious and philosophical concepts probably was the reason for devoting time to writing the book in the first place. It was almost as if that he decided to throw in a riveting thriller plot so he didn't have to share his dark ruminations by himself. 
 Blatty's depiction of Regan's ""possession"" is complicated, ambiguous, and far more nuanced than the screenplay (which Blatty also wrote, winning an academy award) for the famous movie. But that's what books can do that other mediums often fall short of. The amazing thing about looking back at the book from a modern vantage point is to see how much ""doubt"" Blatty raises about the ""demonic possession"" even though the mental health field then wasn't even in the same ballpark with today's modern practices. The fact that Blatty spends more than a fair amount of time exploring the medical possibilities to explain Regan's bizarre behavior seems almost prophetic. 
 Also in the book, using Father Karris as his surrogate, Blatty plays around with a lot of questions... musings... doubts concerning the problems facing humanity. Years before he took on writing the novel, the author studied to be a Jesuit priest and there's little doubt that the failure or problems associated with Blatty not answering the order's call ended up informing the development of the Father Karris character. In fact, the most shocking aspect of the novel is how a plot that is ostensibly about good vs. evil has so much lack of faith on the side of good. It is just one of several miraculously time resistant reasons that this book is still such a great read! 
 Years later, after my initial reading of the book, in 1989 to be exact, I had and encounter with William Friedkin, the director of the movie ""the Exorcist."" Friedkin, was in the middle of directing another supernatural movie hoping to resurrect a career that had a few peaks, but too many valleys since his celebrated blockbuster film from 1973. 
 The movie was titled ""The Guardian"" and I was there because I was just starting out my career as a writer, working for ""Fangoria"" magazine. Often times this is the only way a punk like me gets a chance to spend some time with a director of such great accomplishments - my career escalator was going up from the bottom floor... and Friedkin's career escalator was stuck between floors. 
 Asking Friedkin questions about ""The Exorcist"" was a natural part of the interview. His latest production was clearly an attempt to get back to that early high water mark. Unfortunately, none of his answers concerning his masterpiece yielded any insight, except an unintentional one -- I learned that often times artists don't age as well as their creations. 
 We discussed his relationship with Blatty... the book... the movie they worked on together and why a sequel of ""the Exorcist"" had neither involved, reportedly because of disagreements they endured over the years involving the one project that made them both famous. 
 ""Blatty and I argued a lot,"" Friedlin said to me that day. ""I wish it wasn't the case. The sequel was an abomination. The simple explanation is we didn't always see eye to eye. And neither of us wanted to look the other way."" 
 They would end up having more disagreements over the years, but neither would see the success of their collaboration exceeded, or even approached. Which probably also reveals something insightful about the fragility and complexity of achieving artistic greatness. 
 I was supposed to have a follow-up interview with Friedkin the next day but it was cancelled. I was told later by a member of the crew that the director of ""the Exorcist, ""the French Connection,"" (but also ""Jade"" and ""Blue Chips"") had a disagreement with someone on the set, pulled down his pants and stormed off the soundstage. His comeback film would bomb both commercially and critically a few months later. 
 William Peter Blatty never pulled his pants down in public, but he did over the years make every effort to reveal his soul in his later work. And though he never achieved anything remotely as deep or groundbreaking as his 1971 novel, there were flashes of brilliance in ""The Ninth Configuration"" and ""Dimiter."" 
 The last influence Blatty's work had on me personally came in the literary sequel to ""the Exorcist"" entitled ""Legion."" The book unfortunately was not a return to the artistic quality of his masterpiece. The film based on his novel, which Blatty himself directed, captures some shocking moments and has a few interesting set pieces. But alas, missing from both the book and the movie was any real attempt to further the discussion about the bigger questions of good vs. evil... except at the very end of the novel. 
 The coda of ""Legion"" I found to be very profound. And it was something that stayed with me for years and years. Truth be told, it ended up being the first piece of the puzzle when I began conceiving of the plot for ""Demon Days - Angel of Light."" Reaffirming that it's possible that a writer working at the top of his game can possess you for decades and never let go of your soul.",1.0,0,468,1399.3200000000002,2.99,219,2,5,5

 I thought Cal and Min were both very likable characters who you root for. And Cal has some pretty awesome lines about how Min should love herself just the way she is (no matter what her mother has to say about it!).",0.0,0,106,846.94,7.99,1266,1,3,3

Claudia Parr has everything going for her. A successful editor at a publishing house in Manhattan, she's also a devoted sister, aunt, and friend.

First, the unthinkable: a security breach at a secret U.S. government facility unleashes the monstrous product of a chilling military experiment. Then, the unspeakable: a night of chaos and carnage gives way to sunrise on a nation, and ultimately a world, forever altered. All that remains for the stunned survivors is the long fight ahead and a future ruled by fear of darkness, of death, of a fate far worse.
As civilization swiftly crumbles into a primal landscape of predators and prey, two people flee in search of sanctuary. FBI agent Brad Wolgast is a good man haunted by what he s done in the line of duty. Six-year-old orphan Amy Harper Bellafonte is a refugee from the doomed scientific project that has triggered apocalypse. He is determined to protect her from the horror set loose by her captors. But for Amy, escaping the bloody fallout is only the beginning of a much longer odyssey spanning miles and decades towards the time and place where she must finish what should never have begun.

 Version: Unabridged Audiobook 
 Publisher: Random House Audio 
 Narrated by: Scott Brick (mostly), Adenrele Ojo & Abby Craden (read small passages) 
 I borrowed the audiobook version from my library after seeing it on all sorts of ""best of/must read/best book eva!"" lists. I swear I saw this title repeated so many times in various feeds that the damn thing had been imprinted on my brain and I requested it mindlessly from the library. What I didn't realize though was how long it was until my request came in. Even my librarian commented on the girth of the thing and complained in front of several other patrons that ""I always request the big ones"". Well, that was embarrassing. And it's not even true most of the time. 
 Sheesh, is everyone socially awkward or do I attract this sort of comment? 
 Anyway, where does one even begin with such a tome of a book? It is painfully long and spans nearly a century and features a cast of plenty that made my head spin. It starts out well enough and focuses on the tumultuous early life of a young child named Amy. I really felt for Amy and just as I was getting to know her the book switches gears and outlines a program to develop a race of super humans. Experimental injections are performed on twelve death row inmates and eventually Amy . . . Things go awry (surprise, surprise) and the world as we know it ends when a virus that turns humans into bloodthirsty beasts changes the landscape forever more. 
 Then the book fast forwards, oh almost a hundred years or so, and follows a group of survivors trying to make the best of their world which is still overrun with ""virals"". The First Colony, as they call themselves, live their lives during the day, some of them tucking themselves safely away at night while others keep a lookout for active virals. The virals can't abide sunlight and lights keep them away. But the batteries that allow the lights to function are starting to fail . . . This section of the book pretty much bored the hell out of me. It goes on for hundreds of pages, without too much of anything exciting or engaging happening. We get glimpses into the characters but never truly get to know any of them that well. Too many of these people all blend into one, especially the men who (in this audio version at least) all came across as very similar. They sound similar and there was nothing distinctive about their personalities to help me tell them apart. A few of the women (Sara, Mousami, Elisha) fare a little better. Also, way too many of these First Colony people spend their time lamenting about the fact that they are married to someone but longing for love from another, Um what? Why the heck, in a world where you could be eaten by a viral at any moment, wouldn't you express your feelings to the one you adore and find a little happiness? It didn't make sense and now that I'm finished with the book it still doesn't make sense. I guess people are idiots in the future too. The other thing that didn't make sense was the segregation of the children who are kept oblivious of the dangers of the world and live separately from their families. These people were like sheep, just mindlessly going along with the flow. Why no parents ever stood up and demand change was really unbelievable to me. Wouldn't most parents want to spend every available moment with their child instead of sequestering them with a Teacher until they're eight years old? I just didn't get it and it made me care a lot less about all of them. 
 This review is getting as long as the book so I'll try wrapping it up. The last third does pick up the pace and is actually worth reading. Amy plays a large role in the story. Things all gel together and the big picture is super interesting but the getting there? Not so much. The book is mostly humorless and read in an intensely serious tone by narrator Scott Brick. He does a decent job with the material but at times I completely tuned out without realizing it and had to rewind entire chapters at a time. Now I realize this isn't supposed to be a laugh-fest but a little humor to lighten things up here and there, or even one sarcastic character, would've gone a long way to make the story go down easier for me. And it's all about me, isn't it? I like darkness but this book is too long to be so somber. I realized things were indeed dire when I smiled after a dog viewed a puddle of vomit as an unexpected present. Yeah, I was looking for humor wherever I could get it. 
 I spent nearly two weeks listening to this on audio and I'm relieved it's over. It drained me but not emotionally which is a shame. It was a chore to get through most of it and I probably won't seek out the next one but don't quote me on that . . .",16.0,1,795,3172.05,3.99,141,2,3,3

While I've never read the original novel, I have seen Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now and so made the connection quite quickly. Of course, since Conrad's time the issues have changed and yet in other respects they are perennial. Marina's journey of self-discovery, triggered by its physical counterpart, is also one of those universal themes explored in fiction. 
 'State of Wonder' turned out to be one of those books that I found engaging from its opening pages and could hardly put down. At heart it was an adventure story and there was plenty of excitement as well as an examination of the ethics surrounding medical research and environmental issues. I loved the strength of the story-line, its characters and most of all the Amazon setting. 
 Part of this immediate sense of connection was linked to my work earlier in life with environmental charities where we were advocating the importance of the rainforest along with my continued commitment to the welfare of indigenous peoples, especially in this region. Patchett captures the heat, humidity and the insects of the tropics very effectively. It made me happy that I now live in a part of the world with less exotic flora and fauna. 
 Both this and The Song of Achilles were my favourites among the six short-listed titles for the 2012 Orange Prize. I did favour this one in the final vote due to the issues it explored. It has left me keen to read other novels by Patchett.",10.0,1,605,1210.0,2.0,179,2,3,3

1637,The Blind Assassin,Margaret Atwood,2000,2001,"Margaret Atwood takes the art of storytelling to new heights in a dazzling novel that unfolds layer by astonishing layer and concludes in a brilliant and wonderfully satisfying twist. Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and cliches of the 1930s and 1940s, The Blind Assassin is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience.
It opens with these simple, resonant words: ""Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge."" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a- novel. Entitled The Blind Assassin, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.
For the past twenty-five years, Margaret Atwood has written works of striking originality and imagination. In The Blind Assassin, she stretches the limits of her accomplishments as never before, creating a novel that is entertaining and profoundly serious. The Blind Assassin proves once again that Atwood is one of the most talented, daring, and exciting writers of our time. Like The Handmaid's Tale, it is destined to become a classic.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,7,6,14,8.857142857142858,15,3.95,100153,4.0,"- So are you still trudging through the Margaret Atwood? 
 - George, you should stop being so dismissive! Have you ever read it?

 - So do you want to know what it's about? 
 - You're going to tell me, aren't you? 
 - Only if you want me to. 
 - Okay, okay. I want you to. Snuggle up and tell me all about it. Satisfied? 
 - Mmm. Well, satisfied for now anyway. You know, George, you actually might like it. Some of it's a bit depressing, but there's this very sexy thread where in each episode she meets her lover, and they lie in bed together and he tells her this bizarre science-fiction story... 
 - A bit like we're doing now? 
 - A bit. 
 - I like that. So what kind of story is it?

 - That does sound sexy. I like the snake-filled pits too. 
 - I knew you would. And he's telling it in a very clever, ironic way, and some of the time he's just having fun, and some of the time it's sort of about him and her. 
 - Where does the blind assassin come in? 
 - Well, in the science-fiction story, there's this character who's a blind master assassin. That's sort of the guy telling the story. And he falls in love with this beautiful girl, who's supposed to be sacrificed on the altar. She's sort of the girl he's telling the story to. 
 - How could a master assassin be blind? 
 - Honestly, George, don't be so literal about everything. Anyway, you liked Daredevil, didn't you? 
 - Okay, you got me. Carry on.

 - Why did she kill herself? 
 - You don't find out until the end of the book. It's a whydunnit... 
 - You mean there's a plot and everything? 
 - Honestly, George, of course there's a plot! There's even a twist. 
 - Wow. Okay, so the girl killed herself driving off the bridge? 
 - Yes, and her sister, who's now very old, is writing about her and her book, and what happened to make her write it. 
 - And I suppose the book she wrote is about stuff that happened to her and her sister? 
 - Could be. I don't want to drop too many spoilers. 
 - I still don't see why it has to be so complicated. 
 - Well, you thought Inception was great, didn't you? All those layers? 
 - Yeah...

1638,The Lighthouse,P. D. James,2005,2012,"Shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2012 Shortlisted for New Writer of the Year in the 2012 Specsavers National Book Awards On the outer deck of a North Sea ferry stands Futh, a middle-aged and newly separated man, on his way to Germany for a restorative walking holiday. After an inexplicably hostile encounter with a hotel landlord, Futh sets out along the Rhine. As he contemplates an earlier trip to Germany and the things he has done in his life, he does not foresee the potentially devastating consequences of things not done. ""The Lighthouse,"" Alison Moore's first novel, tells the tense, gripping story of a man trying to find himself, but becoming lost.",Fiction,Intermediate,7,5,13,9.142857142857142,3,3.38,3458,4.0,"This is a story about emptiness; it is a story about how people long for what they do not have, and look for it everywhere and in everyone: it's a story about empty people and empty lives. And in this Moore provides an excellent case study in the characterisation of Futh, a man who embodies an extreme sense of loneliness. 
 It's also about futility and the fruitless nature of such longing. Instead of living in the now and making the most of what we do have the human mind always seeks such impossibilities. This creates a stream of consciousness like feel to some parts of the book. Futh may pick up an item or smell a certain smell and he is drawn back in time, ultimately, relaying his memories and demonstrating how they constantly reassert themselves in his present state. He is unable to move on and escape from the past so he can get on with his life. He has gone on holiday to get over his break-up with his wife, but instead spends the entire trip reminiscing about times gone by. 
 Moore chronicles the life of this sad character, a man rejected by his farther and abandoned by his mother who still seeks some sense of parental love long into his forties. He never got over these early problems in his developmental stages; thus, they are carried through to adulthood. At times it felt like Moore based her character, and his psychological issues, on the Freudian stages of psychosexual development. Futh has developed a strong sense of oedipal complex; he looks for his mother in other women, and especially his wife. She reminds him of his early memories, and he is drawn to the scent that activates his memories. It's why she became frustrated with him, which isn't overly surprising. 
 In his pocket Futh carries the lighthouse, a miniature perfume bottle holder that is his last physical link to his mother. He rubs it in his pocket when he gets nervous. He carries it around with him everywhere and seeks comfort in the caressing of it. It embodies her, a sense of warmth, safety and direction a mother should give to her son. The narrative is interposed with references to this safe-haven, this idealised place or person, which Futh is seeking throughout his life. He becomes a semi-functional being, a man who is deeply socially awkward, incompetent and perhaps even slightly impotent. This longing hangs over his life and prevents him from, essentially, enjoying anything and deriving any sense of success of personal achievement. 
 ""And Futh, looking at the lighthouse, wondered how this could happen--how there could be this constant warning of danger, the taking of all these precautions, and yet still there was all this wreckage."" 
 I think this book is an extremely effective exploration into one man's mind. If anything, Alison Moore shows how early childhood experiences shape a man and linger on for the rest of his life unless he actively attempts to break the cycle. And the ending she leaves us with is utterly open to interpretation, the story echoed on long after I finished reading it. I recommend it highly.",67.0,1,3996,30889.08,7.73,619,3,2,2

1645,The Interestings,Meg Wolitzer,2013,2013,"The summer that Nixon resigns, six teenagers at a summer camp for the arts become inseparable. Decades later the bond remains powerful, but so much else has changed.
In The Interestings, Wolitzer follows these characters from the height of youth through middle age, as their talents, fortunes, and degrees of satisfaction diverge. The kind of creativity that is rewarded at age fifteen is not always enough to propel someone through life at age thirty; not everyone can sustain, in adulthood, what seemed so special in adolescence.
Jules Jacobson, an aspiring comic actress, eventually resigns herself to a more practical occupation and lifestyle. Her friend Jonah, a gifted musician, stops playing the guitar and becomes an engineer. But Ethan and Ash, Jules's now-married best friends, become shockingly successful--true to their initial artistic dreams, with the wealth and access that allow those dreams to keep expanding.
The friendships endure and even prosper, but also underscore the differences in their fates, in what their talents have become and the shapes their lives have taken. Wide in scope, ambitious, and populated by complex characters who come together and apart in a changing New York City, The Interestingsexplores the meaning of talent; the nature of envy; the roles of class, art, money, and power; and how all of it can shift and tilt precipitously over the course of a friendship and a life.",Fiction,Intermediate,4,11,13,11.75,13,3.54,160,5.0,Great book!

On his deathbed, their father extracts a promise: Anya will tell her daughters a story; it is one she began years ago and never finished. This time she will tell it all the way to the end.
The tale their mother tells them is unlike anything they've heard before--a captivating, mysterious love story that spans more than sixty years and moves from frozen, war-torn Leningrad to modern-day Alaska.

1647,The Boston Girl,Anita Diamant,2014,2014,"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Red Tent and Day After Night, comes an unforgettable coming-of-age novel about family ties and values, friendship and feminism told through the eyes of a young Jewish woman growing up in Boston in the early twentieth century.
Addie Baum is The Boston Girl, born in 1900 to immigrant parents who were unprepared for and suspicious of America and its effect on their three daughters. Growing up in the North End, then a teeming multicultural neighborhood, Addie's intelligence and curiosity take her to a world her parents can't imagine - a world of short skirts, movies, celebrity culture and new opportunities for women. Addie wants to finish high school and dreams of going to college. She wants a career and to find true love.
Eighty-five-year-old Addie tells the story of her life to her twenty-two-year-old granddaughter, who has asked her ""How did you get to be the woman you are today?"" She begins in 1915, the year she found her voice and made friends who would help shape the course of her life. From the one-room tenement apartment she shared with her parents and two sisters, to the library group for girls she joins at a neighborhood settlement house, to her first, disastrous love affair, Addie recalls her adventures with compassion for the naive girl she was and a wicked sense of humor.
Written with the same attention to historical detail and emotional resonance that made Anita Diamant's previous novels bestsellers, The Boston Girl is a moving portrait of one woman's complicated life in twentieth-century America, and a fascinating look at a generation of women finding their places in a changing world.",Fiction,Intermediate,12,6,15,11.583333333333334,7,3.79,53055,3.0,"When Addie Baum's granddaughter asks her how she came to be the woman she is today, Addie embarks on a trek down memory lane. It is now 1985 as she relates her life story to granddaughter Ava, but her story goes back many, many years. Addie, now at the wise age of eighty-five, was born to Jewish-Russian immigrants but was born in America and lived her entire life in Boston. The novel is written in a conversational tone as granddaughter and grandmother bond through the sharing of these vivid memories. Addie's mind is sharp and her storytelling is spirited. 
 Addie had spark and was a real go-getter. This was a struggle for her - her parents had old-fashioned values and often butted heads with Addie. Her mother lived a hard life, did not want to leave her home country, and as a result turned into a bitter woman. Addie could never seem to please her mother and this distressed her but did not crush her spirit. Her mother believed a woman's place was in the home and such phrases as ""Marriage and children are a woman's crown"" were frequently hurled in Addie's direction. When Addie meets Miss Chevalier, her own ambition is stimulated when this forward-looking woman proclaims ""I believe that girls need gumption, too, especially in this day and age. I believe you are a girl with gumption."" So begins Addie's leap into the world of library reading clubs, Saturday clubs, and ""girls camp"" at the Rockport Lodge. Much to her mother's dismay, she joins the ranks of working women. Her mother could grumble all she wanted, but the income from Addie's job made a big impact on the family's financial situation. ""What could she really do? Without what I earned, she would be back to sewing sheets ten hours a day and eating potatoes every night. Money is power, right?"" We learn much about what it was like for a woman earning a living during the years surrounding the 1920s. 
 Addie's story touches on a wide range of topics and historic events including World War I, sexual assault, orphan trains, the flu epidemic, suicide, child labor laws, prohibition, and a slew of others. These subjects were discussed in a manner you would expect between grandmother and granddaughter - with brevity and with the gravity due to such topics, but without too much depth. It was interesting to get a snapshot of such events from Addie's viewpoint. Heartwarming tales of friendship and family were also emphasized, and I really enjoyed those snippets of her narrative. Overall, I would say this is a sweet story, easy to read, and worth your time if you want a light overview of a young woman's life during early 20th century America. I was not truly inspired by the writing itself. Having been a huge fan of Diamant's novel The Red Tent, I perhaps expected a bit more complexity and richness in the prose. However, this read more like a memoir; one which I believe would have been more enjoyable had I listened to rather than read Addie's words. I applauded Addie's independence and enthusiasm for life.",67.0,1,4280,21357.2,4.99,1120,4,2,3

But despite its impressive sales, many were disappointed by The Talisman. Rather than a truly chilling epic, what we got was a rather derivative and by-the-numbers fantasy saga. So fans were reluctant to be too hopeful about their second collaboration... but we needn't have worried. Black Houseis much more like it, although even here King and Straub have not quite delivered the ultimate horror marathon--this is a psycho-thriller in the vein of Thomas Harris, but none the worse for that. And there are supernatural elements. This is the tale of a small American town held in the grip of evil. Three children have vanished, abducted by a monster called The Fisherman (after a legendary murderer) with a craving for children's flesh. Ex-detective Jack Sawyer, dealing with his own personal problems (in which he is tormented by visions of another world), is keen to stay away from the horrors of this case, recognising how bad involvement will be for him. But--guess what?--Sawyer is soon supping full on the horrors, and the reader is in for an exhilarating (and highly disturbing) experience. Jack is a powerfully realised protagonist, and his journey into the dark world of The Fisherman is genuinely unsettling. Although more of King's fingerprints are on this one than Straub's (notably the conflicted hero, struggling with his own demons), the co-authors' individual styles merge indivisibly in this highly impressive chiller. --Barry Forshaw",Fiction,Intermediate,15,1,15,7.866666666666666,15,3.99,45,4.0,"Charles Burnside brought shivers down my spine.

On October 1, God is in His heaven, the stock market stands at 10,140, most of the planes are on time, and Clayton Riddell, an artist from Maine, is almost bouncing up Boylston Street in Boston. He's just landed a comic book deal that might finally enable him to support his family by making art instead of teaching it. He's already picked up a small (but expensive!) gift for his long-suffering wife, and he knows just what he will get for his boy Johnny. Why not a little treat for himself? Clay is feeling good about the future.
That changes in a hurry. The cause of the devastation is a phenomenon that will come to be known as The Pulse, and the delivery method is a cell phone. Everyone's cell phone. Clay and the few desperate survivors who join him suddenly find themselves in the pitch-black night of civilization's darkest age, surrounded by chaos, carnage, and a human horde that has been reduced to its basest nature...and then begins to evolve.
There is really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clay, an arrow points home to Maine, and as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north they begin to see crude signs confirming their direction. A promise, perhaps. Or a threat...

 The story centers around a mass event that turns anyone who happens to be on their cell phone at the time into a zombie. Mass chaos ensues and a small group of survivors bands together and tries to figure out what is going on and how to stop it. Some of the plot-line does have some similarity to The Stand, but the characters are fairly unique, the dialog is good, and the action keeps rolling along at a fairly brisk pace.

 This is my second favorite Emily Giffin book (behind Something Borrowed). There was a similar dynamic between Ellen and Margot, much like that of Rachel and Darcy in Something Borrowed. While the premise of the book wasn't the same, you get the same test of loyalty since Ellen is married to Margot's older brother Andy. In fact, I would say that the test of loyalty might be stronger due to the blood relationship between Margot and Andy. 
 Anyways, I don't want to say too much, I had a feeling as to how the book would end given the title...it was just my intrigue to see how Ellen would get from point a to point b. 
 The premise of the story is something I think most people can relate to, male or female, as at some point in our lives I suspect we have all felt the same way about the road not taken. Whether it be a relationship, a job, college...etc. So this made Ellen very easy to relate to...

The book's premise starts off promising enough; high school sweethearts meet again at the funeral of a mutual friend some 25 years later and rekindle their romance... a romance it turns out that had never really ebbed. Dawson Cole, one of the main characters, comes from a family of violent lawbreakers and thugs, while Amanda Collier, the other main character, comes from a wealthy, upstanding family. You get the picture: star-crossed lovers whose personal circumstances ultimately short-circuit their relationship. Great stuff, huh, and vintage Sparks! Then the story and plot begin to unravel for me. 
 First of all, there is the ""ghost"" that keeps showing up at critical times in Dawson's life. This metaphysical ""spirit"" gave the story a cheesy quality and I found it hard to take it seriously. I mean after all, this is not a ""Twilight"" novel! Then there were the letters that Tuck (the deceased friend whose funeral caused Dawson and Amanda to be brought back together again) wrote to Dawson and Amanda. The purpose of the letters is made moot because of the book's contrived ending. Why include these letters in the story if they had absolutely no bearing in the book's finale? It doesn't make any sense! 
 Finally, Spark's, once again, has the chance to have one of his novels end well, yet decides, also once again, to end it tragically. Yes, I know that life isn't an endless series of ""happily ever after"" moments...but neither is it an endless series of tragedies either. You'd think Sparks would have learned to mix it up a bit with the endings to his novels, because he is becoming predictable and to me, that means boring. The ending to ""The Best of Me"" was so contrived and predictable, that I already knew what was going to happen when the ""ghost"" led Dawson to the honky tonk bar!

In a Balkan country mending from years of conflict, Natalia, a young doctor, arrives on a mission of mercy at an orphanage by the sea. By the time she and her lifelong friend Zora begin to inoculate the children there, she feels age-old superstitions and secrets gathering everywhere around her. Secrets her outwardly cheerful hosts have chosen not to tell her. Secrets involving the strange family digging for something in the surrounding vineyards. Secrets hidden in the landscape itself.
But Natalia is also confronting a private, hurtful mystery of her own: the inexplicable circumstances surrounding her beloved grandfather's recent death. After telling her grandmother that he was on his way to meet Natalia, he instead set off for a ramshackle settlement none of their family had ever heard of and died there alone. A famed physician, her grandfather must have known that he was too ill to travel. Why he left home becomes a riddle Natalia is compelled to unravel.
Grief struck and searching for clues to her grandfather's final state of mind, she turns to the stories he told her when she was a child. On their weeklytrips to the zoo he would read to her from a worn copy of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, which he carried with him everywhere; later, he told her stories of his own encounters over many years with ""the deathless man,"" a vagabond who claimed to be immortal and appeared never to age. But the most extraordinary story of all is the one her grandfather never told her, the one Natalia must discover for herself. One winter during the Second World War, his childhood village was snowbound, cut off even from the encroaching German invaders but haunted by another, fierce presence: a tiger who comes ever closer under cover of darkness. ""These stories,"" Natalia comes to understand, ""run like secret rivers through all the other stories"" of her grandfather's life. And it is ultimately within these rich, luminous narratives that she will find the answer she is looking for.",Fiction,Novice,4,6,13,9.75,9,3.37,66742,1.0,"Thank goodness for other reviewers with more patience than me - I was able to understand more about the book in an hour browsing the discussion/review pages on Goodreads than 3 weeks wrestling with the Tiger. After checking others views on the book to make sure it wasn't entirely my fault that the Tiger and I didn't bond, here's the criticisms I still maintain: 
 And using bullet points, because I love 'em: 
 - The fables: It's not that I can't do magical realism, I absolutely can. Marquez; Allende; Esquivel; Saramago; Yes please, serve me up. It's not even that 'The Deathless Man' and 'The Tiger's Wife' are empty stories - the opposite in fact. The problem is a) the stilted nature in which the fables are told b) the link between the two central fables being so precarious as to be utterly unconvincing - is it magic realism or isn't it? I don't think Obreht can decide and c) the fables are buried, to the extent that you feel as though they are being deliberately concealed from you, in a mountain of pointless (though A+) descriptions about inanimate objects (I'll get to that later, it deserves its own bullet point). 
 - Boredom: Other brave reviewers have already said it; even ones who have been so generous as to still dole out 3 and 4 stars. And that is that it all feels a bit pointless. What's the story actually about? What am I left with (apart from a headache?). If you ask me in two weeks I flat out just won't know. 
 - ""A lack of emotion"": (That's actually a quote from the The Guardian's review). Lets use some concrete examples. Natalia and Zora? Their friendship, apparently as old as they are, has about as much depth to it as puddle of water. Why wouldn't Natalia share the news of her Grandfather's death with her so-called ""best friend""? What life experiences had they been through that made them the kind of kids that get kicks out of dissecting, in fairly gruesome circumstances, pigs hearts? Not your average teenage girls, surely - but we wouldn't know because Natalia tells us nothing about what makes her tick (let alone the elusive chain-smoking Zora). And Natalia's Grandfather, arguably the most important character in the book - why are there great gaping holes in what we know about his life? We have such incredible (read ""bbbooooring"") detail surrounding Luka, his mother, his brothers, his father, his musical aspirations, his ten year sabbatical and tragic love songs that aren't even borne out of his own experiences, and for what? I think it is supposed to explain why he ultimately turned into a henous wife-beating monster. Er, sorry, no - it doesn't actually. Just as all the inane detail (pages and pages) about Darisa The Bear's childhood and how it shaped him in becoming a hunter of such great repute in later life - I still fail to see how any of this early detail was relevant to the whole of the story. Or maybe there was no point, and that is the point - ""we're just telling stories"". Oh, Ok!! But, just so you know, it's freaking boring! In my view, the balance of power in this novel is held by the wrong characters - the depth is given to stories that frankly don't deserve it, while complete superficiality (at best) is all that is afforded to the stories that actually matter. 
 - The long, long-winded descriptions: Yes, Obreht can write. If this is an exercise in cramming adjectives into sentences (or WOW words, as we call them in Year 2), yep, she succeeded. And she's 25, the youngest ever Orange Prize winner. Ok, I get it, she's talented! But what use is this without a real life actual story to tell? (see above). Primarily, Obreht's talent is directed towards describing places, objects, and events, (without emotion, as I said before) in the kind of detail only God would notice. And THAT there is probably my main criticism of the book - because remember, we're dealing with a first person narrative. I'm sorry, but a person does not walk into a room and take notice of the way a painting sits half an inch to the left on a wall covered in a fine film of whoknowswhat while some animal scratches beneath the heavy brown floor boards, the ones with the rusty nails protruding out of them threateningly. Here's an example (much better than mine, naturally). 
 ""The street below dead-ended in a flattened patch of pale grass, bordered on either side by netless goal frames. A slide and some tire swings had been set up on the lip of a wheat field that caught the afternoon light and held it in a shivering glare. Beyond that lay the graveyard, white crosses turned out toward the sea. The wind had subsided, and the road was deserted except for a single motted goat, tethered to the fence post of what looked like an enormous metal box opposite the clinic. The BEER sign braced against an oil drum under the awning was to be believed, this was the bar"". 
 Well written? Yes. Riveting? No. Even more implausibly, the vast majority of the time Natalia is recalling this detail based on what she has heard second, third, even fourth hand - or from her grandfather eons earlier. Even if I am to suppose Natalia has some super-human memory that allows her to recall all these minor threads in minute detail, I can't get past the idea that anyone walks around (doing nothing, going nowhere) ""thinking"" to themselves this way. I admit plenty of excellent books combine first person narrative with contextual descriptions of scene or atmosophere (I just finished When God Was a Rabbit - perfect example of the right balance) - but it's usually very subtle. Broken up with dialogue, events, oooh, I don't know - something actually happening once in a while. But Obreht's descriptive passages can go on for pages and pages and none of it adds anything at all to the PLOT (it's not an evil word people). It reminded me of reading a police report, or court transcript. A flowery one, to be sure, but that is the kind mundane observations and recollection of events that you're wading through. I needed more action, more convincing dialogue. Natalia was a person herself without a story, without a VOICE of her own; how ironic is that, being that it's a story about stories. And then when Natalia gets on to recounting what she's been able to glean from the memories of the villagers still living today, and also from her Grandfather based on what he told her before he died, that's when my raised eyebrow really begins to hurt. It's woolly and impossible to tether. 
 - And then there's the grating fact that it's devoid of place. The country, the city, the warring factions, all nameless. Why? Why? Why? 
 I probably didn't need to write such a long review. Goodness knows I already want the last three weeks of precious book reading time back.

 When the wife of a prominent lawyer goes missing at a dinner party, a police search is begun as soon as they are informed. Finding her body in a well in the garden is the beginning of a case for Simpson's detective, Inspector Thanet, which exposes an extremely dysfunctional family: distant father, mother with compulsive shopping and adultery habits, daughter with unsuitable fiancee, another daughter who disappeared four years ago with her own unsuitable boyfriend, never to be heard of again. 
 The Mintar family could provide material for several crime novels; they have a large number of problems and secrets. It is a case where Thanet has almost too many avenues of enquiry, and, taken by itself, the novel would be a superior if traditional mystery. Looking at in relation to the series as a whole, one aspect of Dead and Gone really stands out. Part of the mystery involves incest between a brother and sister who do not know that they are related. This theme has come up before in the Thanet series, and while it provides a variety of convincing motives for murder and other crimes, it is a device which Simpson has now unfortunately used too frequently.",0.0,0,436,2175.64,4.99,238,3,4,3
1659,Sycamore Row,John Grisham,2013,2013,"Seth Hubbard is a wealthy man dying of lung cancer. He trusts no one. Before he hangs himself from a sycamore tree, Hubbard leaves a new, handwritten, will. It is an act that drags his adult children, his black maid, and Jake into a conflict as riveting and dramatic as the murder trial that made Brigance one of Ford County's most notorious citizens, just three years earlier.
The second will raises far more questions than it answers. Why would Hubbard leave nearly all of his fortune to his maid? Had chemotherapy and painkillers affected his ability to think clearly? And what does it all have to do with a piece of land once known as Sycamore Row?",Fiction,Intermediate,22,1,13,4.590909090909091,8,3.98,57537,4.0,"Reading the first fifty pages of Sycamore Row I experienced two very different emotions. Firstly, and I can't remember this happening before, I couldn't help but grin as I lost myself in every page, in fact I wasn't aware I was grinning until I heard my mobile ringing and looked away from the book - smiling! The second emotion was anger. Not of Grisham's writing, his narrative or style, but Seth's distant family. Racist, obnoxious, opinionated and just plain vile - you can't help but feel for Lettie the black housekeeper, a housekeeper tasked with looking after the house and an ailing Seth Hubbard for the last three years. Upon his death and his family's arrival Lettie is cast aside like a mess on a shoe, left to fend for her family and unemployed. 
 Now that I've finished Sycamore Row I can categorically say that those emotions never went away. They would bubble and fester, they weren't always present but it was as if they were stuck in limbo, waiting to emerge just like a pocket of air escaping water throughout the entire story. You never quite knew where the bubble would burst but you knew it would at some point. 
 This is without doubt the best legal thriller I've read this year, hands down the best. Set at a terrific pace this multi layered story evolves and evolves and just when you think it can't go anywhere, that the end is in nigh, the book suddenly branches off in a fresh direction, a new perspective, and Grisham introduces a new witness or a different focus to the investigation. This really is clever and sharp witted stuff! 
 Characterisation is key to any book and it was so satisfying for me to find out what happens to Jake Brigance and his family following the trial of Carl Lee Hailey. Three years down the line he's still dining out on the plaudits and fame from the case - even if the money and rewards aren't as forthcoming - and finds himself stuck in a rut doing the same old cases day in day out. Our protagonist had hoped to have moved on to bigger and better things but alas his loss is our literary gain. 
 John Grisham has brought together an eclectic mix of old and new characters. They all play their part in a legal thriller that is both entertaining and evocative. Even the nasty characters are enjoyable; they all help to add depth and colour to the book but Jake, Ozzie and Lucien carry the book as far as I'm concerned. 
 I enjoyed where the book takes the reader and where it ends and hopefully in a few years' time we'll be allowed to revisit Ford County and experience life in Reuben Atlee's courtroom once again through the eyes of Jake Brigance. With sharp dialogue, atmospheric narrative and a sagacious storyline, Sycamore Row is one not to be missed. Highly recommended.",96.0,1,3969,29013.39,7.31,627,3,5,3

Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled.

 Ohhh Sophie and Alex! What am I going to do with you two!? Other than shout at you and make my husband and pups give me looks of, what in the world is she doing over there? ;) 
 This was a really fun read. A bit steamy but not overly so. The characters, as you see above, are equally as fun. Sophie and Alex are both enigmas and you just hope by the end that they will get their crap together instead of letting so much get in the way! They have both been bitten and although they have a fabulous night of passion, neither thinks they'll see the other, but they do and that one night of passion slowly grows into something more. 
 I love the way the plot is paced. These two do jump into bed rather quickly but they are both consenting adults so this really did add to, not take away from the story for me. Actually it was that night that the basis of the story revolves around. It's actually quite frustrating but also a little hilarious how they dance around each other. Alex drives me a little crazy but I really think they both did at different parts of the book. 
 ""I've no expectations tonight, Sophie"" 
 Sophie was saved from having to make a reply as the doors opened on her floor. She quickly stepped out and made her way to her apartment. He was always so in tune with what she was thinking. Were her feelings written all over her face? Or had their night together created a connection between them that couldn't be broken? But if that were true, why couldn't she feel or see wht Alex was thinking? Perhaps it was etter that she didn't. She had to try to sever their connection, otherwise working with him would be evern harder than she tought it would be. 
 She held the door open for him and he indicated for her to precede him into the room. She turned the lights on, but dimmed them so they created a soft glow. The full moon created a ghostly pattern on the river and was shining in through her window. 
 ""How would you like your coffee?"" she asked as she made her way into the kitchen to turn her automatic coffee machine on. ""I can give you an espresso, cappuccino, latte, or flat white."" 
 She tried to control the shivers coursing through her as he came up to stand behind her. Even after all they'd been through that evening, his aftershave wafted over her. 
 He whistled softly. ""That's an impressive machine. You must like your coffee."" 
 Do you SEE what I mean here? These two, H O T! No sex in that scene but boy did I need some water through this entire book. It's fabulous. 
 The only character I didn't like was of course Neil but he is in the plot for a reason, so we all hate him. And I so do. It was Phoebe that really made this for me though. She is just one of those gals that made me feel like I would tell all of my secrets to and never regret it.

Being an ""old soul"" was obviously exhausting for the main character and at times for me as the listener as well. I had to pay very close attention to the date at the beginning of each section or end up hopelessly lost about the direction of the story. This was exacerbated by a dysfunctional Playaway that would turn off when I hit the slightest bump in the car and revert to a different part of the story. However, as the lives built, layer upon layer of deeper meaning developed for every action, thought, and moment through the story. As always, the language that Atkinson uses is sumptuously beautiful. The idyllic setting developed in a small British village through two world wars, as well as some of London and pre-war Germany, was fascinating.

1672,The Rosie Effect,Graeme Simsion,2015,2014,"Don Tillman and Rosie Jarman are back. If you were swept away by Graeme Simsion's international smash hit The Rosie Project, you will love The Rosie Effect.
The Wife Project is complete, and Don and Rosie are happily married and living in New York. But they're about to face a new challenge.
Rosie is pregnant.
Don sets about learning the protocols of becoming a father, but his unusual research style gets him into trouble with the law. Fortunately his best friend Gene is on hand to offer advice: he's left Claudia and moved in with Don and Rosie.
As Don tries to schedule time for pregnancy research, getting Gene and Claudia back together, servicing the industrial refrigeration unit that occupies half his apartment, helping Dave the Baseball Fan save his business and staying on the right side of Lydia the social worker, he almost misses the biggest problem of all: he might lose Rosie when she needs him most.
Get ready for The Rosie Effect, the new hilarious and heart-wrenching romantic comedy of the year.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,16,16,16.0,12,3.56,1065,2.0,"I'm SO UPSET to give this book only two stars. I'm tempted to bump it up to three stars, because there are definitely some good parts to it and because I absolutely loved the first book, but honestly right now it feels like a two star book. 
 While the first book wasn't perfect, I found it to be utterly charming. Everything about it was so sweet and fun and real. The Rosie Effect, by contrast, feels like ... well, it feels like an author rushing out a sequel to capitalize on the enormous success of the first book. I'm not saying that was the author's intent, but that's what it feels like. 
 Both Rosie and Don clearly have some issues, but it's the way they work together that made the first book work so well. Rosie is a tough character to get, but it seems like she like understands and accepts Don and is making progress in her own life. Don, on the other hand, doesn't logically feel like Rosie is his match, but he connects with her and loves her despite that. Obviously when you have a sequel that's based on a romantic pair you need to throw a wrench in their lives and cause chaos, because otherwise you don't have a story. What I didn't expect was a total reversal of these roles from the first book. I didn't expect the characters to regress. 
 Despite being the titular character, Rosie is basically absent for a lot of this book. She's in the background completing her thesis and generally being every kind of stereotype for an absent-minded shrew of a pregnant woman. Seriously, I wanted to strangle Rosie for the things she was doing and saying. Obviously she's a character with issues, but she was also sweet and fun and accepting. I didn't see any of that here, and it really upset me to see the author write Rosie this way. 
 There are so many other things that made me dislike this one. Don's actions were beyond ridiculous. There are the social faux pas that I would expect from his character, and then there were things that went WAY over the top. There's also the way Gene was part of this book, of which I would say there was way too much of his character -- there was really no point to his part in the story. And then, probably most importantly, is the fact that this book doesn't really have much of a plot. It's all about marital problems, lack of communication, and a crazed social worker (surprise! it's a female character acting completely unprofessionally and illogically) taking out her own issues on Don. Of course things happen, but it really feels like one long ramble with very little purpose to it. 
 I was so looking forward to this one after enjoying The Rosie Project so much, but honestly I would suggest stopping after the first book. This was such a disappointment.",22.0,1,4360,48134.4,11.04,1068,4,1,3
1673,Doctor Sleep,Stephen King,2013,2013,"Stephen King returns to the characters and territory of one of his most popular novels ever, The Shining, in this instantly riveting novel about the now middle-aged Dan Torrance (the boy protagonist of The Shining) and the very special 12-year-old girl he must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals.
On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless - mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky 12-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the ""steam"" that children with the ""shining"" produce when they are slowly tortured to death.
Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant ""shining"" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes ""Doctor Sleep.""
Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan's own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra's soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of hyper-devoted fans of The Shining and wildly satisfy anyone new to the territory of this icon in the King canon.",Fiction,Intermediate,21,1,15,6.857142857142857,8,4.1,98088,5.0,This was definitely my favorite of King's recent works.,0.0,0,361,357.39,0.99,283,1,4,5
1674,Ender'S Shadow,Orson Scott Card,1999,1999,"Ender's Shadowis being dubbed as a parallel novel to Orson Scott Card's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Ender's Game. By ""parallel,"" Card means that Shadowbegins and ends at roughly the same time as Game, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity's fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of Shadow, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know.
Although it may seem like Shadowis merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous Ender's Game, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of Ender's Gamehinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, Shadowmanages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that Shadow, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. --Craig E. Engler",Nonfiction,Intermediate,1,15,15,15.0,2,4.3,1211,4.0,"If you liked Ender's Game, this book complements that story as we follow Bean, learning of his origins before Battle School and getting a taste of the inner workings of his mind. While there is some overlap of the storyline between the two novels, it doesn't feel like all that much material is repeated. The novel also benefits from a much more fleshed out world than of that depicted in Ender's Game (no surprise, of course, but nice none the less). Recommended.",0.0,0,416,411.84,0.99,250,3,1,4
1675,The One And Only,Emily Giffin,2014,2014,"Thirty-three-year-old Shea Rigsby has spent her entire life in Walker, Texas--a small college town that lives and dies by football. Raised alongside her best friend Lucy, the daughter of Walker's legendary head coach Clive Carr, Shea was too devoted to her hometown team to leave. Instead she stayed in Walker for college, even taking a job in the university athletic department after graduation, where she has remained for more than a decade. But when an unexpected tragedy strikes the tight-knit Walker community, Shea's comfortable world is upended, and she begins to wonder if the life she's chosen is really enough for her. As she gives up her safety net to set out on an unexpected path, Shea discovers unsettling truths about the people and things she has always trusted most--and is forced to confront her deepest desires, fears, and secrets.",Fiction,Excellent,6,1,14,6.666666666666667,8,3.11,4661,1.0,"Here is what I learned from reading this book: 
 1. Emily Giffin's favorite word is ""smirk."" Her characters do a *lot* of smirking. If Emily had been allotted a certain number of uses of the word ""smirk"" (or ""smirked"" or ""smirking"") for the duration of her life, she would have used them all up in the 413 pages of this book. 
 2. Fictional Texans who treat football as a religion are almost as annoying as Texans who treat football as a religion IRL. 
 3. Ms. Giffin needs to learn that the phrase has to do with a bad feeling ""in the pit of one's stomach."" Here is a direct quote: ""I didn't answer her question, just turned and walked out the door, a pit in my stomach."" What kind of pit? A peach pit? An avocado pit? An armpit? 
 4. When I am inclined to quit reading a book because it's so annoying, I should listen to my inclinations. 
 For the record, I kept on with this one because I was waiting for the big payoff. I was doomed to disappointment. The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, the writing is clunky and amateurish, and Emily Giffin needs a much better editor.",61.0,1,4293,12836.070000000002,2.99,572,4,3,3
1676,Empire Falls,Richard Russo,2001,2002,"Richard Russo--from his first novel, Mohawk, to his most recent, Straight Man--has demonstrated a peerless affinity for the human tragicomedy, and with this stunning new novel he extends even further his claims on the small-town, blue-collar heart of the country.
Dexter County, Maine, and specifically the town of Empire Falls, has seen better days, and for decades, in fact, only a succession from bad to worse. One by one, its logging and textile enterprises have gone belly-up, and the once vast holdings of the Whiting clan (presided over by the last scion's widow) now mostly amount to decrepit real estate. The working classes, meanwhile, continue to eke out whatever meager promise isn't already boarded up.
Miles Roby gazes over this ruined kingdom from the Empire Grill, an opportunity of his youth that has become the albatross of his daily and future life. Called back from college and set to work by family obligations--his mother ailing, his father a loose cannon--Miles never left home again. Even so, his own obligations are manifold: a pending divorce; a troubled younger brother; and, not least, a peculiar partnership in the failing grill with none other than Mrs. Whiting. All of these, though, are offset by his daughter, Tick, whom he guides gently and proudly through the tribulations of adolescence.
A decent man encircled by history and dreams, by echoing churches and abandoned mills, by the comforts and feuds provided by lifelong friends and neighbors, Miles is also a patient, knowing guide to the rich, hardscrabble nature of Empire Falls: fathers and sons and daughters, living and dead, rich and poor alike. Shot through with the mysteries of generations and the shattering visitations of the nation at large, it is a social novel of panoramic ambition, yet at the same time achingly personal. In the end, Empire Falls reveals our worst and best instincts, both our most appalling nightmares and our simplest hopes, with all the vision, grace and humanity of truly epic storytelling.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,14,14,14.0,12,3.91,91773,5.0,"The small Maine town of Empire Falls has seen better days. The local and once booming timber and textile industries have run their course and all that remains is the abandoned and decrepit real estate of what once was. 
 The blue collar workers of this small New England community struggle to find the few jobs remaining that allow them to keep the wolf at the door and food on the table, ever hopeful of revitalized opportunities. 
 And it is here that we meet Miles Roby, manager of The Empire Grill. Miles is a good and decent man who did not always dream of flipping burgers and taking care of the grill, in fact at one time he had promising opportunities slated for his future. But then life, as it is wont to do, bit back and he answered an urgent call to return home from college and help care for his ailing Mother. 
 The vast majority of the real estate and by extension the job opportunities in Empire Falls are owned and controlled by the Whiting family or to be more precise, Francine Whiting. 
 This really is not a plot driven novel. The real bounty here lay in the character development of the residents of Empire Falls that we largely come to know through Miles Roby. And oh my word, what a treasure trove of characters they are. So real and flawed, everyday folk, fleshed out so well by Russo's pen that you may find yourself recognizing a few of them within your own circle of associates, friends and family. Seriously I am so astounded by the raw talent on display here. These people walk, talk and breathe, stagger and stink all over these pages. And such a wide cast of people, each saddled with their own histories, beliefs, resentments, weaknesses, dreams and strengths and real life struggles. I feel like I know them all intimately. 
 When you get to know people that well, for better or worse, you care about what happens to them. And there is a lot going on here. Miles is on the cusp of a divorce and his ex's future husband loves to hang about and taunt him. His brother is a recovering addict and Miles just can't be sure he won't fall off the wagon. Then there is his teenage daughter Tick who is spreading her own wings while coping with the ruins of her parents marriage. His employer, the stoic Francine, maintains a strange hold over Miles and his father is the most colourful, odiferous vagrant you are ever likely to meet. And so many more. 
 What Russo has accomplished here in Empire Falls is nothing short of masterful. It is a social novel on a grand scale that reflects real life issues with all the inherent joys and sorrows, beauty and blisters. This is epic storytelling that will extend its gracious arms in welcome and bruise your battered, hopeful heart.",109.0,1,5292,15823.080000000002,2.99,458,4,1,2

In the afterword he mentions that Charlie isn't based on his daughter but that his daughter allowed Charlie to be herself and that's apparent in the way he writes her. Really well done, although for fans of King, knowing he can write the stuffing out of a kid isn't that surprising, so it was the tenderness of the relationship that took me off guard and made me appreciate this book so much. It was a nice switch from the usual parent/child stuff he does (ahem Pet Semetary, Delores Cliaborne, The Talisman, etc.) 
 That being said, about half or two thirds of the way through (it's so hard to tell on an eReader) Andy and Charlie don't always appear together and it lost some of it's magic. The villains are compelling and the intrigue of the government agency worked to keep the pages turning, but I confess that I found Charlie and Andy both less interesting without the other. The climax is one of King's best so the last 20% or so it regained it's page turner (or clicker) status and I put it down feeling very satisfied and pleased that I'd read this old school King at last. 
 I'd recommend this book to pretty much anyone, there's no real horror and it's about as sci-fi as Quantum Leap, so don't let the author or subject matter put you off. It's ultimately, like so much Stephen King, an examination of childhood, the loss of innocence, and the power of the individual.

You would think that being all of them are criminals they would all be in jail, instead they seemed to have the run of the town with no one to stop them.

 Tess was the highlight of the book for me. I loved how tough she was, even where there were times that she should have curled up in a ball blubbering. I found Tess's family's feud with the Bycrafts to be interesting, especially considering who she was dating.

In the heat of a hospital laundry room in New Jersey, a woman does her lover's washing and thinks about his wife. In Boston, a man buys his love child, his only son, a first baseball bat and glove.

In prose that is endlessly energetic, inventive, tender, and funny, the stories in This Is How You Lose Herlay bare the infinite longing and inevitable weakness of the human heart. They remind us that passion always triumphs over experience, and that ""the half-life of love is forever.""",Nonfiction,Intermediate,6,6,15,8.833333333333334,5,3.75,68125,5.0,Love this!

1687,The Storyteller,Harold Robbins,1986,2012,"Anna and Abel couldn't be more different. They are both seventeen and in their last year of school, but while Anna lives in a nice old town house and comes from a well-to-do family, Abel, the school drug dealer, lives in a big, prisonlike tower block at the edge of town. Anna is afraid of him until she realizes that he is caring for his six-year-old sister on his own. Fascinated, Anna follows the two and listens as Abel tells little Micha the story of a tiny queen assailed by dark forces. It's a beautiful fairy tale that Anna comes to see has a basis in reality. Abel is in real danger of losing Micha to their abusive father and to his own inability to make ends meet. Anna gradually falls in love with Abel, but when his enemies begin to turn up dead, she fears she has fallen for a murderer. Has she? Award-winning author Antonia Michaelis moves in a bold new direction with her latest novel: a dark, haunting, contemporary story that is part mystery, part romance, and part melodrama.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,8,15,9.058823529411764,4,4.1,107,5.0,"""I'm not answering any questions,"" he said, smiling. ""I'm not one of the answering people. I'm the storyteller."" 
 Abel Tannatek is the storyteller. He is a young man hiding an ugly reality behind pretty words and magical happenings. 
 In order to find out what he is hiding, we are forced to slowly watch as the layers of his true self are revealed, one ugly layer at a time. Secrets are the only method of survival in a world where you can count on no one but yourself. Secrets are the only choice you have when you must protect the life of an innocent. 
 Enter Anna. Sheltered, clueless Anna. She has no idea of the darkness and danger outside of her safe little world. 
 It's late, Anna...they'll be waiting for you, at home...in that house where the air is always blue...they'll be worried. 
 A chance meeting between the school's drug dealer and an innocent, sheltered student came about because of a lost doll. Had Anna not found the doll, she would have carried on her life as usual. There would be no danger, no mystery, no killing for her to know about. One might say that finding the doll was the worst thing that could have happened to her. I would disagree. 
 Abel is a broken human being. He's broken to the point of ill repair, yet Anna still sees something in him that's worth saving. As we see Abel through Anna's eyes, we are shown just how much a person will endure in order to spare a life so precious to him - the life of a tiny little girl in a pink jacket. 
 Abel and Anna bond through time shared as Abel spins wonderful fairytales into existence for his younger sister. Real life becomes the backdrop for the fantasy. Characters in reality become characters in the story. A mystery starts to unfold as characters in the story become bigger players in crimes which start taking place in the real world. Who is the killer? Why does Abel seem to have so much to hide? Why are other people interested in what Abel and Anna are up to? 
 I can't divulge much without going into spoiler territory. The Storyteller is so beautifully written. The depth of character and layers of detail are heart-breakingly intricate. After I finished, I was left with a few different emotions. Anger and sadness were probably the two most prominent, but I can't say that I have any regrets reading this book. I had a hard time putting my reader down because the story of Abel and Anna was such a pull. 
 As for the character flaws...I suppose I should address those. Both Abel and Anna disappointed me in a way because of their actions, yet I felt as if their actions made them more real. Abel was abused, so he had no other experience to draw from in learning how to interact with others. Anna had an empty but satisfactory life and she craved more than her own existence inside of a pretty box. Abel was able to give her something she'd never had before and because of this, she was quick to forgive at times when others wouldn't.

1688,The Magicians,Lev Grossman,2009,2010,"A thrilling and original comingof- age novel about a young man practicing magic in the real world
Quentin Coldwater is brilliant but miserable. A senior in high school, he's still secretly preoccupied with a series of fantasy novels he read as a child, set in a magical land called Fillory. Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery.
He also discovers all the other things people learn in college: friendship, love, sex, booze, and boredom. Something is missing, though. Magic doesn't bring Quentin the happiness and adventure he dreamed it would. After graduation he and his friends make a stunning discovery: Fillory is real. But the land of Quentin's fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he could have imagined. His childhood dream becomes a nightmare with a shocking truth at its heart.
At once psychologically piercing and magnificently absorbing, The Magicians boldly moves into uncharted literary territory, imagining magic as practiced by real people, with their capricious desires and volatile emotions. Lev Grossman creates an utterly original world in which good and evil aren't black and white, love and sex aren't simple or innocent, and power comes at a terrible price.",Fiction,Novice,1,9,9,9.0,13,3.48,93,4.0,"I only came to read this book by way of Warwick's excellent review, for which I am grateful because I really enjoyed the book. Also because without it, I would likely have simply dismissed this book out of hand as genre fiction or, worse, young adult. (This is my particular narrow-minded streak, and it may be keeping me even now from some perfectly fine writing. I have not learned my lesson about it, though, as you will see below.) 
 In any case, I think he's very much on the nose about escapism and readers and how they are at work in this book, and I have little to add on that score*. I do, however, note in perusing others' reactions to it, a new generation of escapism taking hold among those who have decided that Quentin, and with him, Grossman, are somehow misogynists, that this book is not morally pure. 
 It's true that Quentin is a bad boyfriend. He's callow, and selfish, and he cheats on his girlfriend for no reason, hurts her deeply, and then, when she sleeps with someone else, feels angry and hurt in turn, despite having done the same thing to her. He drinks too much, he has no real purpose, he thinks very little about other people except in relation to himself, he's status conscious, he hates himself, and he's difficult to love, and has a hard time loving others. I wouldn't want him to be my boyfriend (but then again, I'm also not 20, just post-college, and drifting.) But none of that makes him a misogynist, and it certainly doesn't make the author one for depicting him in all his dysfunctional glory. Empathizing with him, even; though I would argue that the ability to empathize is part of the novelist's charge, and part of the reader's. There's a deeply ungenerous and problematic view of relationships here, and of people, and of politics, and of literature, and I see it growing, everywhere, all the time, and it makes me angry, sad, and more than a little afraid. 
 Relationships are not a contract. Certainly the feelings that they occasion are not. You can't seriously say to a person, ooops, you're in the wrong, so you cede all rights, on the inside of your head, to be ever hurt or upset, to ever feel betrayed or jealous. Maybe you have no right to CLAIM certain things as a result of your feelings, but to feel them to begin with? Feelings can't be governed by contract, and morality doesn't work like a contract in any case. This kind of judgment is insane. OF COURSE Quentin is still jealous, even though he's in the wrong. What would a book where he wasn't even look like? What would he look like? The beast that eats people's hands? 
 Also, this is not about feminism. I've been wanting to say this for a long time to a good many people. Going through works of fiction, finding men you don't like (which appears to be nearly all of them at this count) and then loudly condemning them on social media, even though they don't even exist, IS NOT FEMINISM. I'm a 45 year old woman and I've been a feminist all my life and I am not ceding that title to this big pack of whiny, useless, spoiled children who don't know the difference between words and actions, depicting something and endorsing it, fiction and reality. You kids can get the hell off my lawn. 
 And about literature. I'm not sure what an approved literature would look like, but I'm starting to think that these twinned desires -- a consumerism which says you get it how you want it, even for art, and an terrifying neo-puritanism that condemns every human failing as though it were a genocide -- are responsible for the plague of adults reading children's books**. Because if what people want is a morally sanitized, grossly oversimplified fantasy where everyone you don't like or disagree with is either a convert or the vanquished by the end, and you get to be a princess, you can't do better than Narnia. This book is exactly about that readerly impulse, and today's neo-puritans are no different than Lewis's cranky christianity***. It's easier to condemn Grossman as morally objectionable than it is to enter into this problem with him and discuss it, but that doesn't mean it's the right response. 
 I'm going to get and read the other two books in this series, and I'm going to do it for my own pleasure and also for spite. Then maybe I'll read a little Jonathan Franzen, pissing off people from a variety of positions on the ideological spectrum, split a couple of infinitives, and finish everything up by doing a little dance. 
 *Warwick is, as should be obvious, in no way responsible for the opinions in the rant that follows, which are mine and mine alone. 
 **ooops, there it is again, my narrow-minded streak, someone somewhere is reeling for the painful force of those words as though they were a bullet, someone somewhere is harmed by that bit of dangerous speech, it's practically like I killed a man! 
 ***Ironic little side note: I also read a couple of reviews of Lewis's original books which condemn THEM as misogynist as well. Much as I think he's an ideological simpleton and a total killjoy, this is one area where he seems perfectly unobjectionable. You really have to be looking for the offense to find it. I think people should maybe stop looking so hard. If they don't want to enjoy their perfectly nice lives, I guess I can't force them, but I wish they'd take their censorious mitts off my literary experience and stop ruining it for the rest of us. So far, some new literature seems to still be written for adults, and the back catalog has not yet been burned, but I'd like to keep it that way, thanks very much.",11.0,1,1692,1675.08,0.99,55,3,2,1

Here, in his newest work, Sparks tells a story about making the greatest commitment of all...loving someone forever.
The Rescue
When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks - risks no one else in the department would ever take - to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate.
Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone.
During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love.
In The Rescue Nicholas Sparks weaves his inimitable spell, immersing us in the passions and the surprising complexities of modern relationships-and in doing so, teaching us something about our own.",Fiction,Intermediate,14,1,14,8.071428571428571,12,4.1,143722,2.0,"I really didn't like Taylor.

1690,The Blind Assassin,Margaret Atwood,2000,2001,"Margaret Atwood takes the art of storytelling to new heights in a dazzling novel that unfolds layer by astonishing layer and concludes in a brilliant and wonderfully satisfying twist. Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and cliches of the 1930s and 1940s, The Blind Assassin is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience.
It opens with these simple, resonant words: ""Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge."" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a- novel. Entitled The Blind Assassin, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.
For the past twenty-five years, Margaret Atwood has written works of striking originality and imagination. In The Blind Assassin, she stretches the limits of her accomplishments as never before, creating a novel that is entertaining and profoundly serious. The Blind Assassin proves once again that Atwood is one of the most talented, daring, and exciting writers of our time.

When he becomes a father himself, he must balance the demands of caring for a young family with his determination to write great literature. A Death in the Family is a Proustian exploration of his past, in which Knausgaard creates a universal story of the struggles u great and small u that we all face in our lives. A Death in the Family is a profoundly serious, gripping and hugely readable work written as if the author's very life were at stake.",Fiction,Intermediate,16,9,16,13.6875,1,4.07,143,5.0,"My first impression of Karl Ove Knausgaard came from a black and white photograph published with a review of his book ""A Time For Everything"" in The New York Review of Books. 
 He is seen smoking against the rugged Norwegian landscape, hair disheveled, wearing an old, battered tee-shirt, lost in thought. Completely and unabashedly himself, yet ill at ease. Entirely present, feet deeply rooted in the present moment, yet his mind is clearly in flight, flickering at the surface of his gaze. 
 The striking portrait somehow encompasses all of the qualities of his writing: intense, raw, physical, elusive, inquisitive and elemental. 
 http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archi... 
 What Knausgaard achieves in ""My Struggle"", his mad yet mesmerizing 6-volume autobiographical enterprise, is simply the most ""real"" depiction of the movements of the mind that I have ever read. A life told in its most boring minutiae and its most elemental highs and lows, as it moves from the most mundane to the most transcendent. 
 Knausgaard plays alongside Proust or Virginia Woolf in his desire to encapsulate all of his experience as a human being, a teenager, a son, a friend, a lover, a father but most of all: a writer. But he does it with even more urgency, more radicality, more anger and more modernity. An Everyman of the 21st century with a 17th century temperament. 
 The second volume of this autobiography, which tackles the fire and vagaries of love as well as the deep ambivalences that lie at the heart of domestic life and parenthood, is utterly engrossing. 
 Read him, and listen to him below speak about Book 1, which deals with his youth and the death of his father, and he might very well change the way you look at the world around you and your own reaction to events.

What would happen if all the Negroes in the South were suddenly given full civil rights? I'll tell you. There'd be another Reconstruction. Would you want your state governments run by people who don't know how to run 'em?

Then the NAACP stepped in with its fantastic demands and shoddy ideas of government--can you blame the South for resenting being told what to do about its own people by people who have no idea of its daily problems? 
 I understand that there are a lot of controversy and conspiracy theories regarding the publication of this book, and for good reason. 
 I read To Kill a Mockingbird in 8th grade. It was class reading. I watched the movie starring Gregory Peck, he of the patrician demeanor, he who, indubitably, best portrayed the noble American icon that is Atticus Finch. 
 To tell you the truth, I didn't really understand the book and what it symbolized then. I was in 8th grade. I had arrived in the US just a few years before. My command of the English was good, but as with all younger teens, the symbolism of the book and its significance largely escaped me. I lacked the analytical skills to truly understand what it meant, what a landmark it was in terms of American history. 
 In 8th grade, before reading this book, our class studied American history. We studied slavery, the Civil War. We studied the ugly past of racism and segregation. We studied Martin Luther King. As a newly arrived immigrant, this should have made an impact on me, but again, I was so young that I didn't truly understand the significance. 
 It was only later on, when I was older, that I understood how important this book was, and how remarkable the character of Atticus Finch was. He, and this book is an American institution. A symbol of righteousness in a past filled with racial injustice. A defender of the underdog. 
 Which is why this book, this sequel to the iconic To Kill a Mockingbird is such a disappointment. If I must be honest, it should never have been written, for in this book, the shining beacon that is Atticus Finch has been grossly tarnished. He has now grown old, bitter, and racist. 
 Yes, I understand that people change. We all do. I understand that a good lawyer can present his case regardless of his beliefs, but that's not the point. The point is that Atticus Finch is such an outstanding figure that it feels wrong somehow to blacken his image. No pun intended. 
 I've seen comparisons to how this book is the most anticipated book since the release of Harry Potter. Well, what if J.K. Rowlings had released a sequel to Harry Potter, in which Harry is an old, grumpy man, going through a mid-life crisis, leering at young girls at the gym, cheating on his wife, ignoring his children? 
 Nobody would like that. Some symbols are here to stay. Some things are meant to remain the way they are. Some things should remain pure. The memory of To Kill a Mockingbird and that of Atticus Finch should be one of them. 
 I wish this book had been left to rot as an old, forgotten manuscript in some long-forgotten warehouse. I want to remember Atticus Finch as a paragon. Sometimes, I want simplicity, and I want bliss in ignorance.

Atwood builds on the world created in the previous book, but totally shifts perspective from a world laced with tech and science to one of religion, ritual and nature. 
 Atwood creates a very engaging story of the lives of two women, Ren and Toby and how their experiences with ""God's Gardeners"" impact their futures. The gardeners' religion is wonderfully crafted, with a well-established doctrine that provides the women with skills and experiences that become more and more useful as the plot advances. I loved all the ways in which Atwood integrates the lost knowledge of our environment, from the free food we could forage to the dangerous poisons growing should we need them. In an age where food is so taken for granted it is always interesting to ponder what would happen if our supplies dried up, and how little we know of the world around us. 
 The story is woven wonderfully around the plot of Oryx and Crake, and although the plot does not advance and further in time-scale it is still immensely engaging to view the whole story from a completely different viewpoint.

1697,The Heir,Johanna Lindsey,2000,2005,"The grandson of a Scottish clan laird, Duncan MacTavish is shocked to learn that his other grandfather was an English marquis whose title and London estate he is now required to take on. Worse still, he is engaged to a stranger who has mocked him in public. But his bride-to-be, Ophelia, has been guiding a lovely and witty, if dreadfully inexperienced, country girl named Sabrina through the latter's all-important first coming-out season. The enchanting Sabrina enthralls Duncan much more than his own intended does, and she shares his passionate feelings as well. But duty and circumstance--plus a scandal in Sabrina's family past--have made it impossible for her and the dashing highlander to be together...unless true love can somehow, miraculously, find a way.",Fiction,Intermediate,3,9,15,11.666666666666666,13,3.79,13,5.0,"Ah, Audible.com, I love ya! Thank you for this offering! 
 OK, Duncan (The Heir) is a bit 'dour' as he arrives (unwillingly) in England from his beloved Scotland. Sabrina is charming (the girl next door with 'scandal' in her past). Ophelia (the beauty of 'coming out' season) is a snot...sorry, I meant snob. Two grandfathers (one English, one Scottish) want their heir to hurry up and marry and produce heirs for each of them. 
 Mix them all together and you have a great recipe for fun especially if the writer (Johanna Lindsey) can handle witty dialog well (she did). If you are listening, all that's left is a really good narrator (Laural Merlington, she is).

1698,The Age Of Miracles,Karen Thompson Walker,2012,2012,"""It still amazes me how little we really knew. . . . Maybe everything that happened to me and my family had nothing at all to do with the slowing. It's possible, I guess. But I doubt it. I doubt it very much.""
Luminous, haunting, unforgettable, The Age of Miraclesis a stunning fiction debut by a superb new writer, a story about coming of age during extraordinary times, about people going on with their lives in an era of profound uncertainty.
On a seemingly ordinary Saturday in a California suburb, 11-year-old Julia and her family awake to discover, along with the rest of the world, that the rotation of the earth has suddenly begun to slow. The days and nights grow longer and longer, gravity is affected, the environment is thrown into disarray. Yet as she struggles to navigate an ever-shifting landscape, Julia is also coping with the normal disasters of everyday life--the fissures in her parents' marriage, the loss of old friends, the hopeful anguish of first love, the bizarre behavior of her grandfather who, convinced of a government conspiracy, spends his days obsessively cataloging his possessions. As Julia adjusts to the new normal, the slowing inexorably continues.
With spare, graceful prose and the emotional wisdom of a born storyteller, Karen Thompson Walker has created a singular narrator in Julia, a resilient and insightful young girl, and a moving portrait of family life set against the backdrop of an utterly altered world.",Fiction,Intermediate,2,6,10,8.0,1,3.64,61891,2.0,"A very promising subject matter but a very dull story....I found this book a real chore and only finished it because it is my Book Club's choice for January

1699,Hearts In Atlantis,Stephen King,1999,2000,"Hearts In Atlantis is composed of five interconnected, sequential narratives set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War.
In ""Low Men in Yellow Coats,"" eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood and that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror.
In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest...and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast.
In ""Blind Willie"" and ""Why We're in Vietnam,"" two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow and haunted as their own lives.
And in ""Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling,"" Bobby returns to his hometown where one final secret, and his heart's desire may await him.
Full of danger, suspense, and full of heart, Hearts In Atlantis takes some listeners to a place they have never been...and others to a place they have never been able to completely leave.",Fiction,Intermediate,16,4,15,8.0625,5,3.8,277,5.0,"No one has ever written the joys of boyhood better than Stephen King. That's not what people talk about when they talk about him, but it's true. It's a subject that needs to be written about entirely without pretense and absolutely free of language too large for ball games and playing in the mud. Between this one, The Body, and It, the good reader will find himself transported into the actual moments of young pleasure, before girls take over and ruin the perfect freedom of true youth. Not that girls are bad, of course, just that something breaks at the moment when boys become aware of them and it never comes all the way back. Often, I wonder about how much of a man's life is spent trying to dance between the moment before and the excitement that comes after the discovery of girls. This small gap is the space that King covers in several of his books and all of them are delightful and thrilling in the way that only a carnival can be to a young boy. Moments of the supernatural and plot aside, it's this subject that draws me to the book. 
 For reasons I can't fully explain, I've read the first 200 pages of this one half a dozen times over the years but never finished it. I've purchased the audiobook twice (by accident) and bought the paperback two or three times (lost copies). I've decided to finish it this time because it's been hanging there, a desire that's been unfulfilled and dangling over me for years. Somehow, I need to be free of it, or at least have passed the experience into the history of my reading pleasures. So here I go. 
 William Hurt was a good choice for the audiobook. There's something about his voice that's trance-like and lulls you right in. I'm glad I've decided to finally and fully experience the book in just this way. 
 King himself read the the next two stories in the book. Some reviewers suggested that the other stories were boring, but that wasn't my feel at all. I quite enjoyed them, especially the title story. I can see, however, that someone whose only reason for reading King is action/horror excitement may not find much of value in a book that's mostly composed of nostalgia and a look back at the turning points that shaped us as people. It's not exactly the stuff of horror lore. If you're that sort, you might want to shuffle on and find another book because this one is far too delicate and filled with entirely too much longing for the adventure seeking reader. 
 Hurt returned for the final story. By now, the crossover between all the stories and characters was wrapped up tight and everywhere. It seemed almost like a novel with shifting perspectives over the years. Depending on your point of view, the interconnections could come across as overly-coincidental or just a tidy way of letting us know where things ended up with various people we'd come to know in their youth. I prefer the latter. Actually, I loved touching in on people years later, finding out how they'd turned out without the direct story of it ever really being the point of the story itself. 
 The plain fact is that this book got to me far more than it should have. It was a beautiful novel shaped like short stories and made of youth lost and memory unwound. Maybe it took me so long to actually read it because I needed the years between to lose more and more of my past into the old fireplace of time. Maybe I needed to remember only enough to know how much I'd lost and how beautiful so much of it had been. Maybe it's a book that can only be understood when your life has made the same sorts of strange turns and you look back, wondering, lost, wistful.",54.0,1,4240,8437.6,1.99,1142,4,3,2
1700,On The Beach,Nevil Shute,1957,1990,"After a nuclear World War III has destroyed most of the globe, the few remaining survivors in southern Australia await the radioactive cloud that is heading their way and bringing certain death to everyone in its path. Among them is an American submarine captain struggling to resist the knowledge that his wife and children in the United States must be dead. Then a faint Morse code signal is picked up, transmitting from somewhere near Seattle, and Captain Towers must lead his submarine crew on a bleak tour of the ruined world in a desperate search for signs of life. On the Beach is a remarkably convincing portrait of how ordinary people might face the most unimaginable nightmare.",Fiction,Intermediate,29,2,15,5.655172413793103,15,3.92,38,5.0,"I loved this. It's one of those classics I'd always intended to read, and with my interest in nuclear apocalypse, one would have thought I'd have read it earlier, but, well, nope. It wasn't until I saw the rather fantastic documentary Fallout about the novel and the film that I remembered it existed, and that I'd never read it. 
 I don't know what there is to say that hasn't been said. I really liked the characters' total inability to accept what the future held, the planning and holding on, and in some cases the total rewriting of the truth. It reminded me in some aspects of the scene in The Time Machine where the Time Traveller finds the museum and muses on the futility of all human endeavour, except that this is a much more visceral rendering of that desperate sense of clutching something that is not going to last. There was a strong sense of country Victoria in the narrative; in the reactions of the characters especially. I was tearful by the end; I think it's hard to get to the end of a book like this and not tear up. 
 One of the things that Fallout says is that a surprising number of world leaders read this, and counted it amongst their favourite novels. I can see why, if only for its bleak warning; still, I don't think we use newspapers intelligently still, and as a denizen of the Southern Hemisphere, I can all-too-easily see destruction wrought upon us down here by our neighbours in the north.",0.0,0,106,589.36,5.56,1251,1,5,5

Charlie is offered a chance to clear his tab: simply stay alone on a ship overnight to prove to its owner and potential crew that it's not cursed nor haunted. Never mind the ship's history of suicide, violence, mutiny and murder. Or how the ship's past crews have gone missing or insane. The fact that no one has set foot on deck in darkness for years doesn't phase Charlie one bit. It sounds like easy money to bust up a superstition or two.

From the synopsis, you know going into the book things aren't going to turn out well for Charlie. 
 Yes, the ""spend one night in a haunted house, graveyard, etc..."" has been done many times, but I'm always a sucker for reading about it, and a ship was a new setting for me. Charlie went into this situation with bravado, chest puffed out, knowing he could do this. And then things rapidly went down hill for him. Much of what happens is in his own mind, but don't let that be deceiving. There were some pretty gory parts that weren't for the faint-hearted. If you read this at home alone, you would definitely be looking over your shoulder. 
 While Charlie was initially skeptical of the hauntings, I felt as if he did an about-face very suddenly rather than gradually changing his mind; however, I found it interesting that he discovered he wasn't the person he'd always believed himself to be. Some of the descriptions also became a little repetitive but, overall, I thought the author did an excellent job with imagery. 
 This novella can easily be finished in one sitting and I would recommend it to horror fans and readers who aren't squeamish.

 Crichton-mode actived! 
 ;) 
 So, my next novel had to be by Michael Crichton! 
 I went to the bookstore and this one was the first book that I checked and after reading the premise, I found it promising. ;) 
 So, I bought it and started to read it. 
 WoW!!!!!!! 
 Since the beginning I was in shock amalgamated with happiness since the style and mood of the novel was astonishing good. (Of course, by then I hadn't read yet The Andromeda Strain, so the idea of gathering a group of expert scientist to deal with something alien was something new for me :P ) 
 I don't know if happens to you, that sometimes if you are reading a novel that it hasn't being made into a film yet (I read the novel like 5 years before to be poorly adapted to a movie) sometimes I imagined some actor or actress to ""play"" the role of the character in my mind, an amusing thing was by then, in 1993, Sharon Stone was in hype due films like ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Sliver"", so when I imagined some actress to fill my image of Dr. Beth Halperin, I thought in Sharon Stone that she eventually got the role! 
 Honest to God! True story! 
 Curiously, 5 years later, Sharon Stone wasn't in hype anymore so, knowing that she was casted in the role that I pictured in my mind was amusing but odd at the same time. 
 I didn't picture Dustin Hoffman for the role of Dr. Goodman, no offense to Mr. Hoffman, which is an actor that I admired a lot, but I thought in Sean Connery for that character. 
 Anyway, the film was a big dissapointment for me since it was very poor adaptation to such excellent book, so if you ever watched the film and you didn't like it, don't worry, that's normal, 
 but please 
 , if that's the reason that you haven't read this novel yet, 
 please go and read it! 
 (Of course, if you have the luck of not having watched the film, please, PLEASE, don't watch it!) 
 I can assure you that the novel is way, way, 
 WAY 
 , better in infinite ways than that mediocre film. 
 I already mentioned the style and mood of the book, I just want to take the topic again to mention that it was a thrilling experience, since you feel that the story is taken very seriously from the scientific angle. 
 All the journey and process of exploring the alien ship is brilliant, you feel that you are there, down in the bottom in the ocean with them, walking with them. 
 There is a major spoiler in this book, that I won't comment here, don't worry, but please avoid at all costs to know that spoiler if you choose to read the book, since it's that kind of spoilers that if you already knew it before of reading the book, simply you will ruin all the fun of actually reading the book and making the investigation along with the scientist group. 
 If you like sci-fi book and/or techno-thriller novels, this is a 
 GREAT 
 option.

Every family has its problems. But even among the most troubled, the Plumb family stands out as spectacularly dysfunctional. Years of simmering tensions finally reach a breaking point on an unseasonably cold afternoon in New York City as Melody, Beatrice, and Jack Plumb gather to confront their charismatic and reckless older brother, Leo, freshly released from rehab. Months earlier, an inebriated Leo got behind the wheel of a car with a nineteen-year-old waitress as his passenger. The ensuing accident has endangered the Plumbs joint trust fund, ""The Nest,"" which they are months away from finally receiving. Meant by their deceased father to be a modest mid-life supplement, the Plumb siblings have watched The Nest's value soar along with the stock market and have been counting on the money to solve a number of self-inflicted problems.
Melody, a wife and mother in an upscale suburb, has an unwieldy mortgage and looming college tuition for her twin teenage daughters. Jack, an antiques dealer, has secretly borrowed against the beach cottage he shares with his husband, Walker, to keep his store open. And Bea, a once-promising short-story writer, just can't seem to finish her overdue novel. Can Leo rescue his siblings and, by extension, the people they love? Or will everyone need to reimagine the future they've envisioned? Brought together as never before, Leo, Melody, Jack, and Beatrice must grapple with old resentments, present-day truths, and the significant emotional and financial toll of the accident, as well as finally acknowledge the choices they have made in their own lives.
This is a story about the power of family, the possibilities of friendship, the ways we depend upon one another and the ways we let one another down.

AUTHOR'S FOREWORD
You might not want to buy this book.
I know, that's not the sort of thing an author is supposed to say. The marketing people aren't going to like this. My editor is going to have a fit. But I'd rather be honest with you right out of the gate.
First, if you haven't read my other books, you don't want to start here.
My first two books are The Name of the Windand The Wise Man's Fear. If you're curious to try my writing, start there. They're the best introduction to my world. This book deals with Auri, one of the characters from that series. Without the context of those books, you're probably going to feel pretty lost.
Second, even if you have read my other books, I think it's only fair to warn you that this is a bit of a strange story. I don't go in for spoilers, but suffice to say that this one is ... different. It doesn't do a lot of the things a classic story is supposed to do. And if you're looking for a continuation of Kvothe's storyline, you're not going to find it here.
On the other hand, if you'd like to learn more about Auri, this story has a lot to offer. If you love words and mysteries and secrets. If you're curious about the Underthing and alchemy. If you want to know more about the hidden turnings of my world...
Well, then this book might be for you.",Fiction,Intermediate,4,2,14,7.75,11,3.91,107,5.0,"This is a story for people like me. 
 Names are important. The act of naming is deep magic, old magic. Of 3s, of 7s, of 9s. Of unnamed stairs, unknown places, of a nameless world named, this story is beyond beauty, it is right, balanced true. 
 Reading this before the official release, is a treat. It is also a privilege. One I am not entirely certain I deserve. 
 By now, you know that this is not book 3 in Pat's wondrous Kingkiller Chronicle. I think it's better than book 3. Better because it's here, ready to be read, to be loved, to be held, to be reread. Book 3 isn't ready yet, and that's okay. Book 3 will arrive in its own time, not before. And when book 3 is ready, it will be... it will be beautiful, and sad, and polished smooth as a round river stone tucked secret by water, time, and patients. But for now, The Slow Regard of Silent Things is to be savored. Best served slow with deliberate attention to appreciation, a nibbling, a pause, a tasting. Don't bolt back this narrative. Rather, relish the layering, the quiet craft, the breathless wonder of secret places, of dark places. 
 This is a sliver of Auri's story, her tending of the world. I can not imagine a better glimpse into the Underthing. I didn't want it to end. 
 I was mesmerized. Call it what you like, spellbound, tongue-tied, lost to the deep-dive rapture of never wishing to surface, I shucked the here, and found myself there. As a reader, Auri is dear to me. I can only hope that what is to come will not press a lasting grief or harm upon her. 
 Keep her safe, Pat. Please keep her safe. 
 We all know Pat is a skilled writer. His proficiency with language and syntactical meter are deceptively pleasing, and when combined with a shrewd attention to detail, you can't help but recognize the art within the craft. This story is unique, in content and presentation. And such dialogue would be better had round a fire, with a dram as winter hunkers down, than in an asynchronous online book review. Yes, this story is a little different. But all you need to know is that it's good. 
 Now, let's talk audiobook. 
 Pat Rothfuss steps out from behind his clackity-clunkity keyboard and permits us to bask in his narrator debut. Rothfuss is a solid reader. Yeah, he's got a pleasing set of pipes. Yeah, he's a great writer. But the guy narrates like a natural. I know I know I know. Reading out loud? What's the big deal? First of all, it is a big deal. And nextly, it's far more difficult than most might imagine. Many professional narrators overact the text, or slip into an ear-bleeding map reading cadence, rendering a jagged, and regretful, audio experience. Rothfuss delivers a reading ripe with feeling and authenticity. I hope, far in the future when Pat has an abundance of time, he will go back and read all of The Kingkiller Chronicles. Not too many authors find success in reading their own work. Neil Gaiman can, but then again, Gaiman could read pharmaceutical warning labels and I'd clap like a drunken seal, barking for more more more! Point being, Rothfuss does a damn fine job reading his first audiobook. 
 Here's my advice: 
 Grab the audiobook. Experience this story as spoiler-free as possible. Keep an ear/eye out for hidden gems within the text, they are there, but I ain't tellin where.",15.0,1,4240,16917.600000000002,3.99,1156,4,3,2

 A difficult book to review without spoilers, but I'm going to try. 
 I enjoyed this book. The central mystery in this book [where was Jenna's mom and what happened on the night she disappeared] kept my interest until the very end. Each character's backstory was fascinating. And the intimate insight (highly researched) into the emotional lives of elephants was (for me) an unexpected and delightful bonus. I seriously learned while reading this entertaining story. 
 What I didn't love was Jenna. Her POV/thoughts didn't match her age. She was 13 years old and was even identified as an ""old soul,"" but she was way, way too wise and objective and savvy. There was some great snark, but at times it felt way too bold for her personality. 
 Also, the major twist near the end of the story strained credulity too much for me in a story where I was already aware of how much I had to suspend disbelief to stay in the narrative (as opposed to analyzing it). 
 That said, I still enjoyed this book and do recommend it. Forget Jenna's age and be prepared to buy into the unbelievable and you'll be good to go.",0.0,0,4779,4731.21,0.99,495,4,5,4

1714,Loving Frank,Nancy Horan,2007,2007,"I have been standing on the side of life, watching it float by. I want to swim in the river. I want to feel the current.
So writes Mamah Borthwick Cheney in her diary as she struggles to justify her clandestine love affair with Frank Lloyd Wright. Four years earlier, in 1903, Mamah and her husband, Edwin, had commissioned the renowned architect to design a new home for them. During the construction of the house, a powerful attraction developed between Mamah and Frank, and in time the lovers, each married with children, embarked on a course that would shock Chicago society and forever change their lives.
In this groundbreaking historical novel, fact and fiction blend together brilliantly. While scholars have largely relegated Mamah to a footnote in the life of America's greatest architect, author Nancy Horan gives full weight to their dramatic love story and illuminates Mamah's profound influence on Wright.
Drawing on years of research, Horan weaves little-known facts into a compelling narrative, vividly portraying the conflicts and struggles of a woman forced to choose between the roles of mother, wife, lover, and intellectual. Horan's Mamah is a woman seeking to find her own place, her own creative calling in the world, and her unforgettable journey, marked by choices that reshape her notions of love and responsibility, leads inexorably to this novel's stunning conclusion.",Fiction,Intermediate,5,5,15,11.0,6,3.74,126,3.0,"This is the story of Mamah Borthwick, the love of Frank Lloyd Wright. 
 I struggled through a lot of this book, not because it wasn't well written but because I didn't like Mamah. 
 I found her character frustrating and both she and Frank self-centered. So although I enjoyed the writing I did not love the story. This has less to do with the author and more to do with the characters which are not actually fictional. I'm on the fence about how to rate a story like this. 
 I think people who like A Paris Wife would also like Loving Frank

 I definitely identified with the drive to make a difference or fulfill one's dreams but I could not shake the fact that SHE LEFT HER CHILDREN. For 2 years she didn't see them and I don't care how much she missed them. Ugh, it was so frustrating. She was self-centered just leaving her children to be raised by her poor sister and husband. Her children deserved a better mother. 
 Frank was egotistical and crazy and a genius and none of this surprised me although I can't see how a woman would want to deal with the public scorn and loss of family to be with him. Of course, I can't think of any reason to walk out on my child. 
 The end completely took me by surprise. Completely. I'm still shocked and had to search the internet to confirm the tragedy. How had I never heard about this before? It's so senseless.

Finally, we get to meet the star of the show - a/k/a the smartest pooch ever grown in a lab. No offense el doggito, but there can only be one Einstein . . .

One kid gets in the car, the others stay put, and their lives will never be the same. Decades later, Dave Boyle, the kid who got into the car, is accused of killing the daughter of Jimmy Marcus, one of the other boys, and the third boy has grown up to be Sean Devine, the cop in charge of the case. Did Boyle do it? And if he didn't, can Sean find the real killer? 
 Yeah, 2013 was supposed to be the year of Dennis Lehane for me. It probably would have been had I not discovered George Pelecanos. However, I'm back aboard the Lehane Train now and quite pleased. 
 While Mystic River is normally classified as a thriller, it's so much more than that, an exploration of growing up and what a traumatic childhood event can blossom into. Mystic River is the tale of three Boston boys who grew up to be very different Boston men. Dave Boyle has drifted from job to job, never quite managing to bury his abduction experience. Jimmy Marcus is a former career criminal who has gone straight and become a family man. And Sean Devine is a cop with a wife he hasn't seen in over a year and a child he's not sure is his. 
 From the beginning, Lehane kept the waters sufficiently muddy to hold my interest. While I knew I was supposed to assume Dave Boyle killed Katie Marcus, Lehane had me changing my opinion quite a few times. None of the three leads are very simple characters. Dave's got his childhood baggage but still tries to be the best husband and father he can be. Jimmy was once a criminal and is still a hard man but is a loving family man. Sean is a supercop but his marriage is in ruins and he's coming off a suspension for something very petty. 
 Once Sean is on the case, the book becomes very hard to put down, like it's been duct-taped to your hands. The mystery, unlike a lot of them these days, is solvable and I guessed who the killer was about 75% of the way through, even though I got the motive wrong. 
 The writing is everything I came to expect from the Kenzie and Gennaro series and then some. I think this is the book where Dennis Lehane went from ""Good Thriller Writer"" to simply ""Great Writer.""

On a rocky patch of the sun-drenched Italian coastline, a young innkeeper, chest-deep in daydreams, looks out over the incandescent waters of the Ligurian Sea and spies an apparition: a tall, thin woman, a vision in white, approaching him on a boat. She is an actress, he soon learns, an American starlet, and she is dying.
And the story begins again today, half a world away, when an elderly Italian man shows up on a movie studio's back lot--searching for the mysterious woman he last saw at his hotel decades earlier.
What unfolds is a dazzling, yet deeply human, roller coaster of a novel, spanning fifty years and nearly as many lives. From the lavish set of Cleopatrato the shabby revelry of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Walter introduces us to the tangled lives of a dozen unforgettable characters: the starstruck Italian innkeeper and his long-lost love; the heroically preserved producer who once brought them together and his idealistic young assistant; the army veteran turned fledgling novelist and the rakish Richard Burton himself, whose appetites set the whole story in motion--along with the husbands and wives, lovers and dreamers, superstars and losers, who populate their world in the decades that follow.
Gloriously inventive, constantly surprising, Beautiful Ruinsis a story of flawed yet fascinating people, navigating the rocky shores of their lives while clinging to their improbable dreams.",Fiction,Intermediate,4,11,16,13.5,10,3.68,118220,2.0,"This book started with such promise. Pasquale was a great character and I would have enjoyed following his story. The Italian setting was lush and Dee Moray's story was interesting until it got crushed by all the random characters and story lines. Richard Burton and Liz Taylor? Really?

 I could not wait to finish this book and escape from these people who make life so damned complicated for themselves and others. For me, the constant changing of past and present times was often disjointed. I did not see anything beautiful, only the ruins of a hyperactive plot.

 ""Pasqo, the smaller the space between your desire and what is right, the happier you will be.""

With those searing whiskey eyes, chiseled face, and cocky attitude it was pretty obvious he was a player. Ordinarily, I would have been able to resist him, but it was my best friend's wedding, and I'd had a lot of alcohol, so I thought, what the hell. At the very least he'd have the skills, and judging by that huge swell in his pants, the equipment to give a bridesmaid a good time.
Of course, we used a condom, actually, a few, but one month later I'm sitting on my bathroom floor looking at five pregnancy sticks all lined up. Each one telling me the same thing: Girl, you're pregnant.
Clearly, he won't want to know, being a player and everything, but my best friend says telling him is the right thing to do.

1727,The Way Of Kings,Brandon Sanderson,2010,2010,"Speak again the ancient oaths,
Life before death.
Strength before weakness.
Journey before Destination.
And return to men the Shards they once bore.
The Knights Radiant must stand again.
Roshar is a world of stone swept by tempests that shape ecology and civilization. Animals and plants retract; cities are built in shelter. In centuries since ten orders of Knights fell, their Shardblade swords and Shardplate armor still transform men into near-invincible warriors. Wars are fought for them, and won by them.
In one such war on the ruined Shattered Plains, slave Kaladin struggles to save his men and fathom leaders who deem them expendable, in senseless wars where ten armies fight separately against one foe.
Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Fascinated by the ancient text namedThe Way of Kingsand troubled by visions of ancient times, he doubts his sanity.
Across the ocean, Shallan trains under eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece Jasnah. Though Shallan genuinely loves learning, she plans a daring theft. Her research hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.",Fiction,Famous,2,7,11,9.0,5,4.64,77,5.0,"It has been quite a while since I read and reviewed an adult epic fantasy - and I believe I'm come a fair way since then - so excuse me a moment of nostalgia before I begin. *deep breath in, deep breath out* Okay good. So first of all, many of you reading this will be thinking ""1,001 pages?! Sod that!!"" but wait. Don't be put off by the size. Though it takes you a little while longer than usual to read The Way of Kings, as can be said for a lot of epic fantasy to be honest, you honestly won't notice the time passing because you're enjoying the book so much. Yep. That good. 
 So, okay.. I'll admit that not very much happened in The Way of Kings yet somehow it doesn't drag. This is book 1 in a planned-to-be 10 volume series called the Stormlight Archive and as such, you can expect that it is the build up book. It is full of glorious world building, the introduction of characters that you'll fall in love with (I'll come to them in a moment), and a magic system that left me floored by the end, but not a whole lot of story-moving action. Saying that, it's the best not-very-much-happens book I've ever read and I heartily recommend it to all fans of fantasy fiction because of the very easy style of writing Brandon Sanderson uses. You find yourself caught up in the flow of words and before you know it - oh my, is that the time?! Better get some sleep.. Okay so I wasn't so fond of the flashback chapters but overall, the story they told was detrimental to Kaladin's character building. They told us about his past and how he became the man he is. 
 As for the story, well.. a world of storms beset by wars ruled by High Princes who care nothing but for their own personal gain while a young man tries to overcome those who have wronged him? It sounds good but it's not exactly eye catching at first glance. I can assure you that the wonder of this story is more than that. Its uniqueness comes from its world building, and the story itself is building to something truly massive. There were moments reading The Way of Kings that gave me chills and had me jumping up and down in excitement and it is official now, I'd thought it after reading the Mistborn trilogy, but now I'm certain: Brandon Sanderson is the God of fantasy book endings. It is worth reading his books for the endings alone and I am entirely jealous of those of you who have yet to experience them for the first time! 
 The characters are wonderful and flawed. Kaladin contains the most build and exploration of any of the characters with his own flashback chapters and self discovery, plus a hefty amount of the chapters being dedicated to him. He is a fantastic character who you want to see win in the end, but he also goes through fits of despair when he feels he is doomed to fail his bridge members and occasionally the ""woe is me"" mentally can get a little old. However, through those parts are these fabulous side characters. Syl the spren who follows Kaladin around, Teft the older guy who turns out to be the most trustworthy of them all, Rock the Horneater who has the biggest heart and made me laugh whether he meant to or not, I don't know, but it was a nice bit of comic relief amongst the depression. 
 We also follow the perspective of Shallan, ward to Jasnah who is sister of the King and a so-called heretic. She was another of my favourites. She's smart and willful and duly takes care of herself. Shallan comes from a family who I very much despise, a family purely out for their own personal gain but Shallan is a little light within them. Though she is sent to steal Jasnah's fabrial, a priceless piece of jewellery which allows the user to use magic known as 'Soulcasting', she finds herself falling in love with this world of research and education and she is as smart as Jasnah. These characters are the closest we come in Roshar1 to strong female characters. Thanks this world's theology, women in Roshar are repressed. Women are the writers, the artists, focusing on the creative arts where men focus on the fighting and the heavy lifting. It works well as a way to show us Roshar's culture, but I am very much hoping to see women bare their hands (currently they must cover their ""safehand"" in a sleeve or glove in public) and sit at the men's tables at dinner later in the series as it hasn't always been this way. 
 Dalinar, brother to the murdered King and uncle to the current sovereign, and Adolin, his son, deserve a mention too. Dalinar is one of the High Princes at war on the Shattered Plains fighting against the frightening Parshendi army, and the only one we really find ourselves respecting. He experiences dreams, or more likely flashbacks to a forgotten time, during Highstorms and people around him believe him to be losing his mind. Adolin was supposedly given a viewpoint to showcase Dalinar a little more clearly and I'm very glad he exists in this way because it gives us a chance to see what's really happening with Dalinar without the worries of a potentially 'unreliable narrator' and the other High Princes. 
 Altogether, we get the viewpoints of royalty and nobility, women, and a slave-turned-Bridgeman, seemingly somebody unimportant. This gives such a well rounded view of the story that it leaves no page unturned. If I had even half of Brandon Sanderson's talent and imagination, I'd be a very lucky little writer-type indeed. 
 Highprince of War, book 2 of the series, is currently being written and it is hoped that it might be released later this year. I really cannot wait! The Way of Kings made its way onto my list of favourite books within about 10 minutes of reading and if you like fantasy and haven't given it a go yet, you're missing out on something great. 
 Oh, and one last thing? I recommend you buy/borrow parts 1 and 2 rather than the whole book in one, unless reading an ebook, because this book is way too heavy to carry around, and you're going to want to.",6.0,1,2200,2178.0,0.99,32,3,2,4

At first Ig thought the horns were a hallucination, the product of a mind damaged by rage and grief. He had spent the last year in a lonely, private purgatory, following the death of his beloved, Merrin Williams, who was raped and murdered under inexplicable circumstances. A mental breakdown would have been the most natural thing in the world. But there was nothing natural about the horns, which were all too real.
Once the righteous Ig had enjoyed the life of the blessed: born into privilege, the second son of a renowned musician and younger brother of a rising late-night TV star, he had security, wealth, and a place in his community. Ig had it all, and more--he had Merrin and a love founded on shared daydreams, mutual daring, and unlikely midsummer magic.
But Merrin's death damned all that. The only suspect in the crime, Ig was never charged or tried. And he was never cleared. In the court of public opinion in Gideon, New Hampshire, Ig is and always will be guilty because his rich and connected parents pulled strings to make the investigation go away. Nothing Ig can do, nothing he can say, matters. Everyone, it seems, including God, has abandoned him.

Brenna harbored no illusions that her husband was in love with her; after a hasty forest wedding, MacAlister assured her she could return home once she had borne him a son.

1730,Freedom,William Safire,1987,2010,"In his first novel since The Corrections, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Walter and Patty Berglund as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.
(from the back cover)",Fiction,Intermediate,10,6,15,8.517241379310345,3,3.73,3971,2.0,"UPDATED. 
 To keep in style of the book this review will be just a lot of rambling. 
 I mean, it was mostly a soap opera. And I just don't do soap operas. I can just about manage about 10 minutes every 5th episode, but that's about it. And Franzen submitted me to 570 bloody pages of a soap opera which I had to digest in a few sittings. 
 Like in all soap operas, everything ends well and love conquers all, of course some characters might have to be killed off along the way, but it seems like a small price to pay for a happy ending, non? 
 If it was well written, then maybe. But how can I take this sort of thing seriously: 
 ""Patty said no, Walter insisted, she insisted no, he insisted yes. Then she realized he didn't have a car and was offering to ride the bus with her, and she insisted no all over again, and he insisted yes"" 
 Sorry, what is this? Is this the Great American Novel? Are you kidding me? 
 ""She almost suggested to Walter that he had better kiss her first, if he was going to be asking her to live with him, but she was so offended that she didn't feel like being kissed at that moment."" 
 And if you are tired of this sugary girly revelations, you can get the more raw stuff when the perspective changes to Katz: 
 ""His dick was saying yes to something now, and this something was certainly not the wideish ass of the retreating jogger. Had death, in fact, been his dick's message in sending him to Washington? Had he simply misunderstood its prophecy?"" 
 You get the idea. 
 And don't even get me started on the fucked up chronology. It wasn't done in eloquent, mysterious way, it was done in a blabbermouth with ADHD way. It is like my friend Maciek, who tells me a story and in the middle of it he remembers some other story that might or might not be related to the story he is telling me so he tells me that other story, and then some other story that somehow came from the second story, and then maybe he will return to the main story and you end up wondering if the second story actually happened in the middle of the first story or it was just his way of telling a story. 
 The final moral from this book is that we are all fucked up in our own special way but it will all be alright unless, of course, we become Republicans, in which case there will be no redemption. 
 It almost killed me. This book almost killed me. But as they say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, therefore this book made stronger, so for that alone I had to give it two stars. 
 I will admit that Patty and Walter were both interesting characters with all the supporting cast being all sorts of caricatures and serving as props to the main duo. 
 Now, I am off to read a book about people who do things and have real problems. 
 *UPDATE - oh yeah. And I also forgot to say that if this book was written by a woman, it would be deemed chick lit and stuck in a pastel colour cover with birds and flowers. No one would even look at it twice because there is so much better chick lit out there. But as Jonathan Franzen is lucky enough to be a man, this, all of a sudden, is the Great American Novel. DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

 Much to my chagrin I have never read Leon Uris! Why I waited? I have no excuses to serve up. Uris writes BIG BOOKS that are quite spectacular. He is one of very few brilliant maestros in literature, in my opinion. He writes with an ease that kept me turning the 648 pages of this great masterpiece. His research into the facts of Palestine and the exoduses to her holy land is extensive and as factual as possible in pre-electronic 1958. His characters are so well developed that I felt each one was a member of my very own family. I cried and laughed with them. I felt their dreams and their pain and the blinding frustration as they followed their life long dream: Palestine! And certainly the British Empire would be their greatest friend, especially since they ratified the Palestine Mandate, right? Wrong. Why? Oil, of course. As the novel begins, the reader is introduced to the British duplicity. Caught on the Cyprus shoreline in British DP camps behind barbed wire are thousands of Jewish refugees waiting for transport to Ersatz-Israel after the conclusion of WW II. Foreign correspondent Mark Palmer and his childhood friend Kitty Fremont are reunited and enjoying the Cyprus sun after the long war in Europe. Since her husband and child's death, Kitty has been on the Greek Island working as a nurse in various orphanages. 
 Ari Ben Canaan, a very handsome sabra asks Mark to stay and will hand him an exclusive. The Mossad agent is going to smuggle 300 children to Palestine right under the British noses! They are to sail on the Exodus in two weeks time. He also needs the services of Fremont, but she is adamant: no. Yes, you guessed it. She eventually does, but only after she meets a young girl named Karen in the camps and hears David Ben Ami's tale of a ""historical abortion."" This tale begins in 1896 Russia and ends with the Rabinsky brothers in Ersatz-Israel many long and difficult years later. 
 We also learn Karen and Dov's stories: the young Jewish girl who Ari squirreled out of Germany and into Denmark and the quiet bitter concentration camp survivor who is more at home in the dark dank sewers under a Polish Ghetto than in the light. We meet the sabras: Dagna, David, Eli, Jordana, and Ari. This first generation of Ersatz-Israel are strong and focused. They are Israel. They work hard without complaint to reclaim the ""dead"" land and will fight to their death to see Palestine as the independent state of Israel. Death threatens on all sides, neither the Arabs nor the Brits want them there. The ship Exodus is both a symbol and a life dream.

1733,The Shell Seekers,Rosamunde Pilcher,1988,1987,"Set in London and Cornwall from World War II to the present, Rosamunde Pilcher tells the story of the Keeling family, and of the passions and heartbreak that have held them together for three generations. The family centers around Penelope, and it is her love, courage, and sense of values that determine the course of all their lives,
One of Penelope's most treasured possessions is The Shell Seekers, which her father painted and left her as a remembrance and a legacy. It is this painting that symbolizes to Penelope the ties between the generations. It is the link between the past, the present, and the future. But it is the fate of this painting that just may tear the family apart....
Rosamunde Pilcher's writing demonstrates a deep sensitivity to human frailties, desires, and joys. She weaves a story that bursts with emotion, so involving it is impossible to put down. The world she creates and opens up to you becomes a place you feel comfortable, a place you can't wait to return to, a place you will never forget.",Fiction,Excellent,47,6,15,10.340425531914894,11,4.13,219,5.0,"""The most ordinary of prospects caused her to stop and stare. The last of the leaves dropped from the trees, and the bare branches made lace against pale skies. Sun after rain turned cobbled streets blue as fish scales, dazzling to the eye. Autumn winds, whipping the bay to a scud of white-caps, brought with them, not cold, but a surging sense of vitality..."" 
 Penelope Keeling knows how to live life to the fullest and I absolutely adore her! She grasps those things that matter most in life - the comfort of a home, the security of a loving mother, the laughter of friends and family, the feel of soil and the beauty of the outdoors, the enticing smells of home-cooked meals, and the allure of a splendid painting. When I come across a character in one of my books that touches me and makes me want to re-examine my own life, then I know I have found a gem. 
 Of course, we're all familiar with the phrase ""don't judge a book by its cover"". Unfortunately, I have been guilty of that offense in the past and no less so with this book. I have seen Rosamunde Pilcher's novels in bookstores and libraries and have admittedly walked right on by due to their overly feminine and botanic covers. I didn't think they were ""my sort of book"". However, I decided to give this one a try when I discovered some trusted Goodreads friends were reading this. Well, thank goodness I did - such a true delight! At the outset, we learn that Penelope is a sixty-four-year old widow that has had a surprise glimpse at her own mortality. We are introduced to her three adult children - Nancy, Olivia and Noel - as well as others that have touched her life at some point or another - her treasured mother and father, an ill-suited husband, a loyal friend, a devoted lover, a grieving young woman and a secretive yet trustworthy gardener. Each character is drawn with such depth and clarity that I felt I really knew each and every one of them. The title of this novel, The Shell Seekers, derives from a painting given to Penelope by her father, the prominent artist Lawrence Stern. When the now deceased Lawrence Stern's works of art become much sought-after, the value of this and other pieces increases significantly. Each of Penelope's children have their own thoughts about what should be done with this and other works in their mother's possession. What they desire reveals to us much about each of them, their innermost substance. As with real people, what we see is not all pretty. Pilcher has the gift of depicting riveting family dynamics. ""Family rows are like car accidents. Every family thinks, 'It couldn't happen to us,' but it can happen to everybody. The only way to avoid them is to drive with the greatest care and have much consideration for others."" 
 Penelope makes a journey to Cornwall, both in spirit and literally, where she sweeps us along to revel in the landscape and her own cherished memories. I loved every minute of this visit and will miss my time spent with Penelope. Heart-warming, memorable, and a bit of a tear-jerker, The Shell Seekers is a treasure I won't soon forget. I am quite pleased that several more Rosamunde Pilcher novels now grace my bookshelf with their blossoming covers and their promise of comfort and pure reading satisfaction.",135.0,1,35424,176765.76,4.99,811,5,4,2

A lot of it is valid, but there are certain times that he's the perfect author to be reading. Like last night when a winter storm blew through. Freezing temperatures, snow, ice, and high winds made it look like an Artic wasteland outside. As I lay reading under my warm blankets, I paused for a moment and listened to the wind making the house creak and the sleet hitting the windows, and thought, ""This is just about the perfect setting to be reading a Stephen King book."" The fact that it was a very damn good Stephen King book was an excellent bonus. 
 As if to give us a break after recent high page count books like Under the Dome and Duma Key, King delivers four short-n-sweet novellas focusing on the nastier sides of people with just a hint of the supernatural. These are four tales about the lives we build that we tell ourselves our safe, sane and secure, but there's always darkness lurking at the edges. King points out that sometimes we're the ones who invite that darkness in. 
 In 1922, a Depression-era farmer in the Midwest just wants to work with his son and read books in the evening, but his wife wants to sell some land her father left her to a hog factory and use the money to move to the city. When the two can't reach an agreement, the farmer decides to murder her and hide the body in an old well. Even worse, he manipulates his son into helping. What results is a chilling story of the unintended consequences that one crime and the ensuing guilt can cause. 
 Big Driver features Tess, an author who writes cozy mysteries about a group of elderly amateur female detectives that are popular with grandma-types. Taking a short cut home from a speaking/signing engagement, a flat tire leads to Tess being raped and left for dead. After escaping, Tess realizes that since she's a quasi-celebrity going to the police would result in a media firestorm that would taint the rest of her life so she decides to seek her own revenge. 
 Dave Streeter is a man with terminal cancer who gets a mysterious offer for fifteen more healthy years of life in Fair Extension, but he has to nominate someone to get a heaping dose of bad luck in his place. Since he's got a lot of resentment and grudges against his best friend Tom and his perfect life, Streeter decides that his old buddy deserves some misfortune. 
 The question in A Good Marriage is how well do you know your spouse? Darcy and Bob have been together 25 years and if things are a bit dull and ordinary at this point, they've built a good life and are generally content. When Bob's away on business, Darcy goes looking for batteries in the garage and discovers a horrifying secret that her husband has been keeping. 
 This is some of the best stuff that King has done in years. By focusing on human nature rather than supernatural monsters, he was able to create some very relatable yet scary stories. We know that we won't really be trapped in old hotels filled with ghosts or live in a town overrun by vampires or chased by demon cars that drive themselves. But getting a flat tire on a lonely road? Finding a dark secret about a spouse? Being jealous of a friend doing better than yourself? Watching your life unravel because of a bad decision you've tried to hide? Those are things that we really fear, and King uses them all skillfully to deliver some of his creepiest stories yet.",118.0,1,107,640.9300000000001,5.99,1236,1,4,1

From the internationally best-selling, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, a superbly crafted new work of fiction: eight stories--longer and more emotionally complex than any she has yet written--that take us from Cambridge and Seattle to India and Thailand as they enter the lives of sisters and brothers, fathers and mothers, daughters and sons, friends and lovers.
In the stunning title story, Ruma, a young mother in a new city, is visited by her father, who carefully tends the earth of her garden, where he and his grandson form a special bond. But he's harboring a secret from his daughter, a love affair he's keeping all to himself. In ""A Choice of Accommodations,"" a husband's attempt to turn an old friend's wedding into a romantic getaway weekend with his wife takes a dark, revealing turn as the party lasts deep into the night. In ""Only Goodness,"" a sister eager to give her younger brother the perfect childhood she never had is overwhelmed by guilt, anguish, and anger when his alcoholism threatens her family. And in ""Hema and Kaushik,"" a trio of linked stories--a luminous, intensely compelling elegy of life, death, love, and fate--we follow the lives of a girl and boy who, one winter, share a house in Massachusetts.

1739,Crossroads Of Twilight,Robert Jordan,2003,2014,"The #1 New York Timesbestseller, available in trade paperback for the first time--featuring new cover art
The Wheel of Time(r), Robert Jordan's internationally bestselling fantasy series, has captured the imaginations of millions of readers worldwide. Now book number ten in the series, Crossroads of Twilight, will be available in trade paperback for the first time. This new edition will feature cover art from artist Greg Ruth. This stunning cover art debuted on the eBook and will now grace bookstore shelves in this handsome new edition.
Fleeing from Ebou Dar with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, whom he is fated to marry, Mat Cauthon learns that he can neither keep her nor let her go, not in safety for either of them, for both the Shadow and the might of the Seanchan Empire are in deadly pursuit.
Perrin Aybara seeks to free his wife, Faile, a captive of the Shaido, but his only hope may be an alliance with the enemy. Can he remain true to his friend Rand and to himself? For his love of Faile, Perrin is willing to sell his soul.
At Tar Valon, Egwene al'Vere, the young Amyrlin of the rebel Aes Sedai, lays siege to the heart of Aes Sedai power, but she must win quickly, with as little bloodshed as possible, for unless the Aes Sedai are reunited, only the male Asha'man will remain to defend the world against the Dark One, and nothing can hold the Asha'man themselves back from total power except the Aes Sedai and a unified White Tower.
In Andor, Elayne Trakland fights for the Lion Throne that is hers by right, but enemies and Darkfriends surround her, plotting her destruction. If she fails, Andor may fall to the Shadow, and the Dragon Reborn with it.
Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn himself, has cleansed the Dark One's taint from the male half of the True Source, and everything has changed. Yet nothing has, for only men who can channel believe that saidin is clean again, and a man who can channel is still hated and feared-even one prophesied to save the world. Now, Rand must gamble again, with himself at stake, and he cannot be sure which of his allies are really enemies.",Fiction,Intermediate,12,1,12,6.083333333333333,8,3.82,67,3.0,"""If your enemy offers you two targets, strike at a third."" WoT book ten, Crossroads of Twilight has the reputation for being the worst/slowest in the series. That may be true, but by no means does it make it a bad book. In my opinion, I think the negative reviews of CoT are a bit exaggerated. 
 There is very little plot advancement in CoT. None of the major subplots really move forward. However, CoT seems to be focused on priming each major subplot to move forward in subsequent books. This seems to be the case based on reviews I've read for Knife of Dreams, the next book. CoT involves a lot of political maneuvering. Jordan gets criticized for going too heavy on the politics from Lord of Chaos onward, but I enjoy the politics. The politics behind the action is what makes the action great. It means that when action actually happens, the stakes are much higher because of all the political maneuvering that underpin it. I think Egwene and the Salidar Aes Sedai are good examples of this. However, the politics have limits, and they were exceeded in CoT. Without even a modicum of action to accompany the heavy politics, it made CoT slow and unbearable at points. Elyane's subplot is a prime example. At the end of Winter's Heart, Elyane is confronted with invaders. Yet, in CoT the invasion stays where it is and we get no development on that front. The worst example of the cliffhanger hangover is Rand. WH ended in a huge way with the cleansing of the taint. However, we don't even get a Rand chapter until 3/4 through the book. For me, that was a big letdown. 
 Despite obvious shortcoming, I still did enjoy CoT. Mat and Tuon's subplot was great. I love their budding relationship. I think that CoT was the necessary segway into having all of the pre-last battle subplots begin to resolve. The book is called Crossroads of Twilight. I believe that the book was a crossroads for the series. With the last battle looming, things need to get resolved. And for things to be resolved, things need to be in place. CoT got the thankless job of getting things in place. Ultimately, I give CoT three stars. While not a ""bad"" book, it still is one of the weakest in the series thus far.",0.0,0,108,430.92,3.99,1170,1,5,3

At first Ig thought the horns were a hallucination, the product of a mind damaged by rage and grief. He had spent the last year in a lonely, private purgatory, following the death of his beloved, Merrin Williams, who was raped and murdered under inexplicable circumstances. A mental breakdown would have been the most natural thing in the world. But there was nothing natural about the horns, which were all too real.
Once the righteous Ig had enjoyed the life of the blessed: born into privilege, the second son of a renowned musician and younger brother of a rising late-night TV star, he had security, wealth, and a place in his community. Ig had it all, and more--he had Merrin and a love founded on shared daydreams, mutual daring, and unlikely midsummer magic.
But Merrin's death damned all that. The only suspect in the crime, Ig was never charged or tried. And he was never cleared. In the court of public opinion in Gideon, New Hampshire, Ig is and always will be guilty because his rich and connected parents pulled strings to make the investigation go away. Nothing Ig can do, nothing he can say, matters. Everyone, it seems, including God, has abandoned him.

She's been stricken with something the old-timers call ""Milk Sickness.""
""My baby boy..."" she whispers before dying.
Only later will the grieving Abe learn that his mother's fatal affliction was actually the work of a vampire.
When the truth becomes known to young Lincoln, he writes in his journal, ""henceforth my life shall be one of rigorous study and devotion. I shall become a master of mind and body. And this mastery shall have but one purpose..."" Gifted with his legendary height, strength, and skill with an ax, Abe sets out on a path of vengeance that will lead him all the way to the White House.
While Abraham Lincoln is widely lauded for saving a Union and freeing millions of slaves, his valiant fight against the forces of the undead has remained in the shadows for hundreds of years. That is, until Seth Grahame-Smith stumbled upon The Secret Journal of Abraham Lincoln, and became the first living person to lay eyes on it in more than 140 years.
Using the journal as his guide and writing in the grand biographical style of Doris Kearns Goodwin and David McCullough, Seth has reconstructed the truelife story of our greatest president for the first time-all while revealing the hidden history behind the Civil War and uncovering the role vampires played in the birth, growth, and near-death of our nation.",Fiction,Intermediate,7,4,15,8.0,6,3.7,107211,3.0,Review to come.,0.0,0,348,344.52,0.99,291,1,3,3

The king is dead, murdered by a strange and horrible poison. But while the land of Delain mourns, the magician Flagg, unscrupulous, greedy and powerful, plots. Soon the king's oldest son, Peter is imprisoned at the top of a high tower, the Needle, for his father's murder, while his younger brother Thomas inherits the throne.
Only Peter knows the truth of his own innocence, and the truth of the evil that is Flagg. And only Peter can save Delain from the horror Flagg has in store.

The black, heart-shaped box that Coyne receives in the mail not only contains the suit of a dead man but also his vengeance-obsessed spirit. The ghost, it turns out, is the stepfather of a young groupie who committed suicide after the 54-year-old Coyne callously used her up and threw her away.

I was not ecstatic early on about the premise, as I believed it was insufficient to sustain a book of this length. Although I have read better horror books, this one turned out well enough. What makes it special though is that Joe Hill just happens to be the son of none other than Stephen King. The apple remains in the orchard. The guy has talent, and I expect there will be much more product in the years to come as he follows in daddy's footsteps.

Meet Martin, JJ, Jess, and Maureen. Four people who come together on New Year's Eve: a former TV talk show host, a musician, a teenage girl, and a mother. Three are British, one is American. They encounter one another on the roof of Topper's House, a London destination famous as the last stop for those ready to end their lives.
In four distinct and riveting first-person voices, Nick Hornby tells a story of four individuals confronting the limits of choice, circumstance, and their own mortality. This is a tale of connections made and missed, punishing regrets, and the grace of second chances.
Intense, hilarious, provocative, and moving, A Long Way Downis a novel about suicide that is, surprisingly, full of life.
What's your jumping-off point?
Maureen
Why is it the biggest sin of all? All your life you're told that you'll be going to this marvelous place when you pass on. And the one thing you can do to get you there a bit quicker is something that stops you getting there at all. Oh, I can see that it's a kind of queue-jumping. But if someone jumps the queue at the post office, people tut. Or sometimes they say ""Excuse me, I was here first."" They don't say ""You will be consumed by hellfire for all eternity."" That would be a bit strong.
Martin
I'd spent the previous couple of months looking up suicides on the Internet, just out of curiosity. And nearly every single time, the coroner says the same thing: ""He took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed."" And then you read the story about the poor bastard: His wife was sleeping with his best friend, he'd lost his job, his daughter had been killed in a road accident some months before . . . Hello, Mr. Coroner? I'm sorry, but there's no disturbed mental balance here, my friend. I'd say he got it just right.
Jess
I was at a party downstairs. It was a shit party, full of all these ancient crusties sitting on the floor drinking cider and smoking huge spliffs and listening to weirdo space-out reggae. At midnight, one of them clapped sarcastically, and a couple of others laughed, and that was it-Happy New Year to you, too. You could have turned up to that party as the happiest person in London, and you'd still have wanted to jump off the roof by five past twelve. And I wasn't the happiest person in London anyway. Obviously.

New Year's Eve was a night for sentimental losers. It was my own stupid fault. Of course there'd be a low-rent crowd up there. I should have picked a classier date-like March 28, when Virginia Woolf took her walk into the river, or November 25 (Nick Drake).

 Newest pet peeve: When the marketing department in a publishing house decides it would be a great idea to promote just about any new psychological thriller as ""The NEW Gone Girl"" to sell the hell out of it. This seems unfair to me. If a person loved Gone Girl-they could be disappointed, and if they hated Gone Girl-they might not give it a chance.

 ""Her"" Jodi (the wife) -A non-confrontational part-time psychologist, part-time Martha Stewart-esque housewife-who because of childhood trauma, has learned to bury anything unpleasant so deep that it is like it never happened. 
 The Plot: 
 After 20 years in a ""common law marriage"" Todd knocks up his best friends daughter and decides to leave Jodi completely penniless. Jodi decides Todd should die. 
 As usual I read quite a few reviews before writing mine, and as usual I am going to disagree with a lot of them. Cause that's how I roooollllll......or maybe it is because I have no idea what I am talking about. I just don't get why some reviewers have to like the people they are reading about, to like a book. Did you like Betty Jane Hudson or Blanche in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? How about Reality T.V's Richard Hatch on Survivor, some of you I am sure watched..and loved to hate. So what is so different about fiction novels? I adore books with flawed characters! I loved to hate Todd in THE SILENT WIFE. I loved every shake of my head when I read his thoughts, and every time I caught myself rolling my eyes at his stupidity. He was real. I hated that he was real, but sadly enough I have met more men like him than I care to mention, and I loved Jodi! I sympathized with Jodi. It was completely believable to me that she would turn out to be exactly as she is because of her past and regardless of her profession (I am the daughter of a psychiatrist-and believe me speaking from experience, they don't say psychiatrists have the craziest families for no reason.)

1752,Ender'S Shadow,Orson Scott Card,1999,1999,"Ender's Shadowis being dubbed as a parallel novel to Orson Scott Card's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Ender's Game. By ""parallel,"" Card means that Shadowbegins and ends at roughly the same time as Game, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity's fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of Shadow, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know.
Although it may seem like Shadowis merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous Ender's Game, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of Ender's Gamehinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, Shadowmanages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that Shadow, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. --Craig E. Engler",Nonfiction,Intermediate,1,15,15,15.0,2,4.3,1211,4.0,"I enjoyed this book better than Ender's Game, of which this is the sequel.

Our hero is selected, and when asked what he would like, opts for a single bell from Santa's sleigh. 
 I knew that I could have any gift I could imagine. But the thing I wanted most for Christmas was not inside Santa's giant bag. What I wanted more than anything was one silver bell from Santa's sleigh. When I asked, Santa smiled. Then he gave me a hug and told an elf to cut a bell from a reindeer's harness. The elf tossed it up to Santa. He stood, holding the bell high above him, and called out, ""The first gift of Christmas!"" 
 This is one of the all time great magical stories, with stunning illustrations. I read this to my kids every year on Christmas Eve since the late 1980s.

 So I got on to Goodreads and added it to my to-read list.

 What a mistake that would have been. I am shocked at the average rating of this book. I had only glazed over reviews, only because I wanted to avoid the chance of spoilers (generally negative reviews tend to be rife with them), but from what I can gather, some people have called this a knock off of Stephen King's IT or The Body. 
 Well, I guess if Pyper can be accused of anything, it would be a wonderful portrayal of four young friends in a creepy setting, and a revisit of the town's Bad Thing in their adult years.

 This book was outstanding. Like King, he writes kids great, and also writes them great as adults. He also creeped the hell out of me. This morning as I was nearing the finish, I was lying on the couch where the telephone is over my head. Alone in the house, of course. Yes, the phone has to ring

Charlie Asher is a typical Beta Male. He's not exceptionally handsome or tall or strong, and he's definitely not the heroic type. But the slightly neurotic Asher has a good life; he owns a secondhand store in San Francisco, and his wife, Rachel, is about to give birth to their first child. Then the unthinkable happens: Asher's wife dies shortly after giving birth to a baby girl. When Asher inexplicably witnesses a Merchant of Death (a seven-foot black dude named Minty Fresh, who sports a green suit and is invisible to everyone else) enter the hospital room and take his wife's soul, he too becomes involved in the soul re-acquisitioning business. Accompanied by two giant hellhounds and his trusty sword-cane, Asher's dirty job leads him to an apocalyptic confrontation with the real forces of darkness
Comparable to works from popular satirical authors like Tim Dorsey, Carl Hiaasen, Terry Pratchett, and Paul Di Filippo, Moore's blend of dark fantasy, supernatural mystery, and absurdist fiction will have readers irresistibly hooked from the first page to the last.

Meanwhile, Lincoln O'Neill can't believe this is his job now- reading other people's e-mail. When he applied to be ""internet security officer,"" he pictured himself building firewalls and crushing hackers- not writing up a report every time a sports reporter forwards a dirty joke.

By the time Lincoln realizes he's falling for Beth, it's way too late to introduce himself.

I knew it was going to be good from the very first chapter (which I promptly read to my mother while we both laughed). Giving it five stars might be a bit much, but I can't help it. This was funny, engaging, sweet, and, more importantly, smart. None of the characters were perfect, but they were written so realistically that their flaws added to their appeal. It felt like reading about real people, not the cliche's of people one normally gets in a piece of modern fiction. 
 The premise is pretty basic; Lincoln is a shy and socially awkward individual who never quite got over the heartbreak caused by his high school sweetheart. Having recently moved back to his hometown (and back into his overindulgent mother's house), he gets an IT security job at the local paper. His job involves reading through flagged email and sending out warnings to anyone in the office who breaks company rules regarding internet use. When he starts getting flagged emails between Beth and Jennifer, he knows he should send them a warning and move on, but he can't seem to bring himself to do it. Before he knows it, he's read so many of their conversations that he feels like a total creep, but he still can't bring himself to stop. It's when he begins to fall for Beth, however, that Lincoln's torture truly begins. 
 Told from a third-person perspective with Lincoln at center stage, we only get to know Beth and Jennifer through their emails to each other. While this is often a difficult method for an author to use to truly portray a character (especially since people only project a certain amount of themselves to others, especially through emails), Rainbow Rowell managed to really make it work. I felt like I really got to know Beth and Jennifer through their emails, and for the first time in too long, I can actually understand why the male protagonist fell in love with the female. Beth and Jennifer are genuinely good people, devoted friends, and beautifully flawed individuals. We see Jennifer's fears about becoming a mother are caused by her rocky relationship with her own mother. We see Beth's ignorance regarding the myriad ways love can manifest and exist. We see Lincoln's insecurities unfold as he attempts to struggle out from beneath his mother's apron and live his own life. While the underlying theme is romance, the story also focuses on family, friends, and personal growth. 
 I know this makes Attachments sound paralyzingly dull, so you'll just have to trust me when I say it's really quite funny. It's probably the funniest book I've read in the last few years. I understand it's probably not for everyone.

1768,Her Fearful Symmetry,Audrey Niffenegger,2009,2009,"Six years after the phenomenal success of The Time Traveler's Wife, Audrey Niffenegger has returned with a spectacularly compelling and haunting second novel set in and around Highgate Cemetery in London.
When Elspeth Noblin dies of cancer, she leaves her London apartment to her twin nieces, Julia and Valentina. These two American girls never met their English aunt, only knew that their mother, too, was a twin, and Elspeth her sister. Julia and Valentina are semi-normal American teenagers--with seemingly little interest in college, finding jobs, or anything outside their cozy home in the suburbs of Chicago, and with an abnormally intense attachment to one another.
The girls move to Elspeth's flat, which borders Highgate Cemetery in London. They come to know the building's other residents. There is Martin, a brilliant and charming crossword puzzle setter suffering from crippling Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; Marjike, Martin's devoted but trapped wife; and Robert, Elspeth's elusive lover, a scholar of the cemetery. As the girls become embroiled in the fraying lives of their aunt's neighbors, they also discover that much is still alive in Highgate, including--perhaps--their aunt, who can't seem to leave her old apartment and life behind.
Niffenegger weaves a captivating story in Her Fearful Symmetry about love and identity, about secrets and sisterhood, and about the tenacity of life--even after death.",Nonfiction,Novice,3,6,14,10.0,9,3.24,64364,5.0,"This was difficult to put down but I deliberately tried to read slowly beause it was such a pleasure to read. Niffenegger is one of the finest contemporary writers and noone does longing and stymied love better than she does. 
 This book reminded me of ""Time Traveler's Wife"" as well as ""The Lovely Bones."" The stories center on an apartment building right off of Highgate Cemetery in London. One apartment belongs to Elspeth Noblin who dies on the first page of the book and bequeaths the apartment to her twin nieces in America, with the stipulation that they must live there for a year before selling and that their mother, Elspeth's own twin, can never set foot in the apartment. The top floor apartment is occupied by Martin, who suffers terribley from OCD. Niffenegger's rendering of OCD is the most painful and seemingly realistic depiction that I've come across. Elspeth's somewhat younger lover lives in the first floor apartment and works as a tour guide at Highgate Cemetery. 
 This book is well worth reading BUT you really need to suspend disbelief and just go with the really wild premise. This is part love story, part ghost story, maybe even a little Sci Fi. Suspenseful, surprising, and beautifully written.",68.0,1,4280,16221.2,3.79,1120,4,2,2

 Meh. I borrowed Gone from the library due to it's intriuging cover and the fact that a friend had specifically not recommended it to me, saying I'd hate it. I decided to read it anyways, going in with a positive attitude and hoping to prove her wrong. Unfortunately, she knew me too well. 
 As I've mentioned several times in previous reviews, I love original and refreshing plots and characters. Gone lacked both of these. Knowing that the novel was about a student-teacher romance I expected high-stakes and angst but instead it was causal, bland, and boring. I ended up finding Connor's neighbours' and friends' lives more interesting than Connor's. His mother's alcoholism was random and didn't really affect the plot other than to isolate Connor from his family, which I guess may have led Connor to seek companionship in Corrina? One of the most poorly written aspects was the romance between Corinna and Connor. I didn't understand the initial attraction or the sexual tension. I thought it was really juvenile and unrealistic that they'd fall in love with each other in only a week and become so intimate so quickly. This was definitely not an accurate representation of how relationships, let alone studen-teacher relationships evolve. 
 I think Kathleen Jeffrie Johnson tried to tackle too many issues in such a short novel and it ended up as a jumble in the end. Alcoholism, death, teenage romance, sexuality, student-teacher relationships, drug abuse, loneliness, abuse, etc. are all very controversial and tough issuse to conquer individually let alone all in th same novel. I wish that Connor's thought process had been more clearly explained, for example if he had compared his relationship to Zach and Risa's and seen the differences for him and Corrina the reader might have understood why he wanted to move with her so badly. In novels like this it's so hard to write an ending that applies to each of these topics so in the end Kathleen focused on isolation (hence the title ""Gone"") which may have worked as a final chapter if there weren't so many other pressing issues and logistics left unfinished. 
 Despite not liking the overall novel there were a few points I did enjoy. I thought it was very creative to have the student-teacher romance not take place during the school year or on school property but rather in the summer, where the chances of being caught and the repurcussions were a bit different. I liked how Corinna was an average formally-troubled woman who happened to fall in love with a student as opposed to a sensual provocative woman lurring every male at school. The fact that she was as isolated and naive as Connor made her seem more like a fellow student than someone almost 10 years older than him.",0.0,0,670,3678.3,5.49,166,2,3,2

 http://fangswandsandfairydust.com/201... 
 Audiobook provided by publisher for review. No remuneration was exchanged and all opinions presented herein are my own except as noted. 
 I enjoyed much of this book but I have a hard time with a cultural anomaly. These British Lords eat ""cookies;"" cookies is not the word in common usage at the time, or even now, in Britain. (http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcooki...) 
 With a tale of desperate love and seriously bad family matters, the love story was interesting. I enjoyed the narration of a romance by a man with a lovely plummy accent. At first it sounded over the top but James Langton's voice was actually a pleasure to listen to. 
 But all I could think of was those cookies, COOKIES! If she had called them biscuits or seed cakes I might have been okay. But we all know that the Regency world, at least as presented in novels, was highly structured and full of manners that were so forced into the aristocracy they must even have been employed in private. These young brothers behave most casually when walking about their house. It is hard to imagine an Earl procuring a fistful of cookies (Page 189), or finding his brothers ""lounging against the wall, munching cookies,"" (page 287), or sauntering out of the kitchen with cookies in hand (page 287). It just feels feels culturally wrong, especially within the genre, although looking at the caricatures and political and social art, for example Rowlandson's, the aristocracy was made to look much less cultured than the way they are presented in the romance genre. 
 It also feels wrong because the while a little unusual, the characters are portrayed as quite cultured and so it feels as if they aren't staying in character. 
 And, I realize I am speaking about genre specific convention which is the langiage of the genre. Expectations don't necessarily have to be fulfilled. 
 There are some great twists and turns and the sexual aspect, which felt unlikely, is included. 
 But, oh well, this was one of Publisher Weekly's best romance books of 2010, so it's entirely possible this is just a case of me being rather picky. It appears to be her first or an early published historical. So it could be a case of research, and surely should have been caught by an editor. 
 But as the story progressed all I could think was ""cookies?!""",1.0,0,4158,16590.420000000002,3.99,592,4,1,3

I more or less agree with it) and liked it. Though I did feel that the ending of that book was a little abrupt but overall the content was very strong and moving. That is why when I received a request to review this book I grabbed the opportunity. 
 The blurb will remind you of the Scarlett Keeling case (you can google to know more about her). I had assumed that the book would be a rehash of that incident but I was taken by surprise when the protagonists mentions the case in the beginning and takes it as a reference point for the Liza Kay case. In fact the book becomes quite real when the protagonist Simran talks about the Delhi rape case and how it has affected her thinking. Of how she relates the disappearance of Liza with the insecurity she feels for her own daughter. 
 The book is Simran's journey of finding the truth about Liza and of getting justice for her. The book has its own flaws, there are loopholes in the investigation or the way the book wraps up but at the end of the day it is a good book to read because it shows you a murky reality. It shows us a side of Goa which is hard to believe but surely exists. It shows us a side of today's youth which is again hard to accept but sadly exists. 
 It is a good read which makes you cringe, think and contemplate. It reminds you of the horrific Delhi rape case and of the crime rampant against women. It reminds you that in this society if you are wearing a skirt you are asking for being raped!! And by smoking/ drinking etc you are actually handing over a open invitation to be raped. Mind you after all this; the truth is ""you had asked for it"". The book is very contemporary even in the terms of depicting how corruption is deeply rooted in our society & how easy it is for people with power to escape punishment for their deadliest deeds.

FBI agent Brad Raines must turn to a most unusual source for help.,Fiction,Intermediate,1,14,14,14.0,16,3.84,7665,5.0,"""An eerie, engaging novel bringing to the light a unique view of those we judge as mental ill."" 
 Being a fan of Ted Dekker, I knew the type of novel I would be reading when I selected The Bride Collector. Dekker is one of my favorite fiction authors. For instance, I knew I would find dark suspense (often not for the squeamish), tight well-written plot and dialogue, and a focus on some component of Christianity.What I did not expect was to begin to question my perception or at least to reconsider my perspective on what is truly considered 'mentally ill.' 
 The story centers around Brad Raines, an FBI agent in pursuit of a deranged serial killer, who engages a select group of residents at the Center for Wellness and Intelligence, a facility for the highly intelligent mentally ill. 
 The killers identity is revealed early in the novel giving the reader an 'insiders view' of the mind of such a psychopath. He is on a mission from God, or so he believes. He kills beautiful women believing that he is delivering them to God and arranges the crime scene to display the victim as a perfect bride. 
 The backdrop of the story is the interaction of Brad Raines with those we call mentally ill. These are exceptional bright people with mental disorders. This comparison of ideologies, the intelligent and the insane, intrigued me. 
 The element of frankness, innocence, and an untainted outlook on life is revealed in one of the most engaging characters, Paradise Foundry. She is intelligent but also damaged by events in her life. She doesn't consider herself mentally ill but has no desire to leave the facility. Fear is her mental illness. 
 Loved this novel and appreciated that it contained no profanity or vulgarity. The best writers have no need for such things in their novels. I recommend it for those that love suspense and/or thrillers but I do warn those that are squeamish. I am looking forward to the next Dekker novel.",7.0,1,478,5253.22,10.99,213,2,1,3
1785,The Art Of Fielding,Chad Harbach,2011,2011,"The Art of Fielding is an expansive, warmhearted novel about ambition and its limits, about family and friendship and love, and about commitment - to oneself and to others.
At Westish College, a small school on the shore of Lake Michigan, baseball star Henry Skrimshander seems destined for big league stardom. But when a routine throw goes disastrously off course, the fates of five people are upended.
Henry's fight against self-doubt threatens to ruin his future. College president Guert Affenlight, a longtime bachelor, has fallen unexpectedly and helplessly in love. Owen Dunne, Henry's gay roommate and teammate, becomes caught up in a dangerous affair. Mike Schwartz, the Harpooners' team captain and Henry's best friend, realizes he has guided Henry's career at the expense of his own. And Pella Affenlight, Guert's daughter, returns to Westish after escaping an ill-fated marriage, determined to start a new life.

 The setting, a small college in Northern Wisconsin (Lake Michigan, not Superior, though) trying to take steps to become ever-more environmentally conscious, was uncannily like where I work right now, Northland. The characters were more than memorable--they were a bunch of people I'd love to call friends. Meditations on many things, baseball, relationships, etc, were fairly transcendent. Loved the focus on Melville. Would have liked a little more word play throughout (lovely turns of phrase fade after the first 1/3 of the book) and a bit more love for the Northwoods from the narrator (the narrator seems obsessed with cold and dreariness in WI--which is a lot of the experience, but certainly not all).

 The Shadow King is a story about a group of young kids who are trying to survive in a world that has been taken over by ""shadows"". They must do whatever it takes to survive in the wasteland of a world. 
 A book that's over before it even begins. I think this would be a good ""episode 1"" or ""book 0.5"" in a full series. Granted there are some things that you wouldn't want to come out in the first book that came out in this book. 
 I do enjoy short stories, novellas, and novelettes more than most people do, but this one felt a little too short for me. I honestly thought that it was just getting into the good stuff and it ended. Granted, it had an ending of sorts, but it still felt rushed. I'm not sure if Lozar ended it like this on purpose or if they have thoughts of doing more with the story later (I think there's something here). It had a Lord of the Flies meets I Am Legend feel to it. 
 The narration of The Shadow King was done by Quinn Lozar who voices the characters pretty well. The story was fast paced and his narration definitely moved it along. 
 Overall, an enjoyable short book. I definitely don't regret the hour that I spent listening to this.",0.0,0,483,2057.58,4.26,210,2,2,5

At first, Lo's stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for--and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo's desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong...
With surprising twists and a setting that proves as uncomfortably claustrophobic as it is eerily beautiful, Ruth Ware offers up another intense read.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,19,4,16,7.263157894736842,9,3.66,111301,3.0,"I just knew I was going to love this book because I love the cover.

Well, it was kinda like that. What is it with everyone having to be drunk all of the time in these books? 
 When I first started the book last night, I couldn't put it down. I wanted to get to the ship and see what was going on. Then once we were on there, I wanted to keep going but sleep took me away. 
 The beginning of the story was bleh for me because I just wanted to get to the boat and I didn't see any reason for that beginning. Then when you're on the boat and the beginning is used against the main character, Lo Blacklock, I began to understand. 
 Lo is a travel journalist and is finally getting to go on a trip because her boss is preggers. Unfortunately for her, she sees a body get thrown off the boat, no one believes her, she has no proof and when she does get proof, it gets removed. She wonders if she's crazy or what. 
 I just wanted to get to the end to see what in the world was going on and who did what, when and how. I certainly didn't think it was actually what happened. Then throughout the book there were reports of Lo Blacklock's death and they found a body and I was like, ""What?"" 
 It's all crazy train, er, crazy boat, but I did enjoy it. Unfortunately, I didn't love it near enough to buy the book with the awesome cover. Or did I?

Years later, one of them, Andy McGee, is on the run from The Shop, with his daughter, Charlie. Can Andy and Charlie evade The Shop before their world goes up in flames? 
 First off, for years now, I cannot read the title without hearing the Prodigy song of the same name. Maybe he'll follow this one up with a book called Fuel my Fire or Smack My Bitch Up one of these days to continue along the same lines. 
 Firestarter is one of those Stephen King books you don't hear all that much about. A lot of people only know of it because of the movie starring Drew Barrymore in the 1980s. Well, more people should know about it because it's a corking good read. 
 A 1960s experiment gave Andy McGee and his wife psychic powers. It also altered their DNA enough to produce Charlie, their immensely powerful psychic daughter, whose abilities include pyrokinesis, hence the title. 
 For a good portion of the book, the suspense comes from Andy trying to stay one step ahead of The Shop. The rest of it is the two McGees trying to escape The Shop's clutches. The Shop, and John Rainbird, make fantastic villains because they aren't nearly as far outside the realm of possibility as evil cars and spider-clowns. 
 Like a lot of Stephen King books, the relationships between the characters keep the story going. John Rainbird proved to be more than the scene-chewing villain I originally pegged him as. Unlike the protagonists in Doctor Sleep, I feared for Charlie and Andy almost constantly. 
 I'd forgotten how brutal King was sometimes in his older books. There are some parts of this one I'll remember for a long time. Maybe Stephen King will revisit a character or two from this book before he goes to the clearing at the end of the path, maybe as part of a Dark Tower story.

Miss Bianca would seem to be a pampered creature, and not, you would suppose, the mouse to dispatch on an especially challenging and extraordinarily perilous mission. However, it is precisely Miss Bianca that the Prisoners' Aid Society picks for the job of rescuing a Norwegian poet imprisoned in the legendarily dreadful Black Castle (we all know, don't we, that mice are the friends of prisoners, tending to their needs in dungeons and oubliettes everywhere).

It will take everything they've got and a good deal more to escape

 My Disney source material readthrough has led me to The Rescuers, and it appears that while there are two movies based on these characters and several books in the series, none of them were adapted exactly into either of the films. It was still fun and interesting to read the inspiration for the films and get to know the characters as Margery Sharp originally envisioned them. This story was simple but well fleshed-out, and the society of mice is amusing and actually makes sense (even though it never really says where they live or how they work internationally). I'm still not sure whether or not the poet belonged in prison, or what he did to get there in the first place (apart from the assertion that ""he's a poet""), but the point of this story was the mice anyway. Miss Bianca is a charming little character, refined and quite self-assured, but also just the slightest bit vulnerable. Bernard is loyal and devotedly attached to Miss Bianca, and Nils provides an energetic element as the third in the trio. The threats they faced seemed fitting for the setting and scope, and although things worked out a little conveniently, it was fun to see how it all played out. There was a simplicity and something poetic about how this was written, which was refreshing compared to current children's literature. 
 As for the illustrations, as much as it pains me to speak ill of Garth Williams, I just don't understand why he feels the need to make every living creature look like every bit of them is covered with shaggy hair. Let the mice tails and the humans' noses have some smooth lines! I promise it will be okay. 
 Disney didn't really take many cues from this book for either of its Rescuers movies, but this was a quick, refreshing read. It's a fun premise for a book series, and it was good to discover the original Bernard and Miss Bianca.",2.0,1,2866,8569.34,2.99,22,3,1,1

 SWEDISH REVIEW 
 Om det ar nagot Mo Hayder kan sa ar det att skriva bocker som gar under skinnet pa en. Precis som Dennis Lehane sa vagar hon ta ut svangarna och det ar med isande fasa man laser varje sida. 
 Forsvunnen ar inget undantag. Att lasa om kidnappade barn ar hemskt och man vet inte om Jack Caffery kommer att lyckas radda situationen. Caffery ar en lysande polis, men i denna bok sa verkar det som om kidnapparen kan forutse polisen nasta drag och ju mer tiden gar desto mer lutar det at att det ar forsent, att flickan inte kommer att raddas. 
 Sedan har vi polisdykaren Flea Marley, som lever med konsekvenserna fran foregaende bok, vilket stor henne i jobbet. Hon vet inte om att Jack misstanker henne for ett brott som hon faktiskt ar oskyldig till men som i och med det Jack vet om det ter sig logiskt att han misstanker henne. Nu ger hon sig in kampen for att radda den kidnappade flickan. Men ar hon verkligen i form att ta sig an fallet? Kommer hon istallet bara att riskera sitt eget liv? 
 Forsvunnen ar en ruggig thriller dar den okande forovaren hela tiden lurar i bakgrunden och man sitter pa helspand pa slutet nar Caffery konfronterar forovaren. Fragan ar kommer allting att sluta lyckligt?

 ENGLISH REVIEW 
 If there is one thing Mo Hayder knows is it to write a book that crawls under your skin. She dares, just like Dennis Lehane can she write in such a way that it's with terror you turn each page. 
 Gone is no exception. Reading about kidnapped children is always terrible and you do not know if Jack Caffery will be able to save the kidnapped girl. Caffery is a brilliant police, but in this book, the kidnapper seems to anticipate every single move the police do, and as more time goes by, the fear grows that they will be too late. 
 Then we have police diver Flea Marley, who lives with the consequences from the previous book, which has consequences for her at work. She does not know that Jack suspects her for a crime she's actually innocent of. Although it's quite logical that he suspects her since he doesn't have the whole picture. Now she decides to search for the kidnapped girl. But, is she really in shape to help out? Or will she only risk her own life? 
 Gone is a tough thriller where the unidentified perpetrator always lurks in the background, and at the end, when Caffery confronts the perpetrator will you still question if everything will end happily...

And it's a summery read =) I quite enjoyed it. I wasn't sure it was going to be good, but I was wrong and I just might read the other books. 
 Here's the thing, just don't go in the water when you know people have been killed by a shark. What the hell is wrong with people? 
 I wish I could have watched the movie again so I could see how much was different in the book. Some of it I don't think even happened in the movie but I'm not sure as I have lumped all the movies together in my head. Lol 
 The corrupt people are in the book not wanting to shut down the beach. The town would never survive the winter if they don't make lots of money in the summer. Who cares if some people get eaten. Lets just cover it up. Isn't that the way? 
 Then we get the ole boys out to try to kill a fish. That didn't go over too good and it was sad for the most part. But I still loved it.

Among the tangled waterways and giant anacondas of the Brazilian Rio Negro, an enigmatic scientist is developing a drug that could alter the lives of women for ever. Dr Annick Swenson's work is shrouded in mystery; she refuses to report on her progress, especially to her investors.Shortlisted for the 2012 Orange Prize.",Fiction,Intermediate,15,3,16,8.8,8,3.86,120,5.0,"It was fairly obvious that Patchett's tale of a trip undertaken into an inhospitable jungle in order to track down a maverick researcher had taken inspiration from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness; even the official synopsis above directly evokes this reference. While I've never read the original novel, I have seen Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now and so made the connection quite quickly. Of course, since Conrad's time the issues have changed and yet in other respects they are perennial. Marina's journey of self-discovery, triggered by its physical counterpart, is also one of those universal themes explored in fiction. 
 'State of Wonder' turned out to be one of those books that I found engaging from its opening pages and could hardly put down. At heart it was an adventure story and there was plenty of excitement as well as an examination of the ethics surrounding medical research and environmental issues. I loved the strength of the story-line, its characters and most of all the Amazon setting. 
 Part of this immediate sense of connection was linked to my work earlier in life with environmental charities where we were advocating the importance of the rainforest along with my continued commitment to the welfare of indigenous peoples, especially in this region. Patchett captures the heat, humidity and the insects of the tropics very effectively. It made me happy that I now live in a part of the world with less exotic flora and fauna. 
 Both this and The Song of Achilles were my favourites among the six short-listed titles for the 2012 Orange Prize. I did favour this one in the final vote due to the issues it explored. It has left me keen to read other novels by Patchett.",10.0,1,605,1210.0,2.0,179,2,3,3

So many things I want to say, so many things I wish I remembered to say. But, the first thing that comes to mind is that it's amazing. Likely one of the best books I've read this year. It's a bit long and a good portion of it could have been cut out, but I loved how absorbed I got in the world. I listened to it at work. I listened to it on my way home from work. I listened to it on my way home from school. I listened to this over the weekend while I was doing chores. 
 All of the characters, in their own way, were likeable and unlikeable. I rooted for all of them at some point and time, then I rooted against them at others. I don't think I can think of any other book where I've had that unique feeling. 
 Not only that but the tone of the book is perfect. It captures the old feel of Georgian times. Then, it captures the slightly mysterious and bewitching feeling that England has, specifically older England because this book is a mix of Georgian and the early Plantagenet rule to it. Then, there's the slightly creepy feel of magic to it. Basically, the perfect book for October since it really feels creepy, mysterious, and bewitching.

After all, it includes such amazing tales as The Mist and The Jaunt. It must be amazeballs, right? Not so much. Even the epically awesome stories in this collection need to be trimmed down. Most of them start slower than a Lars Von Trier movie, and over half of them never really pay off. There are some serious WTF stories within this collection; stories I didn't understand ten years ago and still do not understand today. In other words, the reread didn't help. That doesn't mean your experience will not be different. It does not mean you will not understand the Milkman stories or appreciate King's cute-ass poem about anthropomorphized fruit that he wrote for his youngest son Owen. I understand why they are in this collection, but that doesn't mean I have to like them. Mostly, this collection is tedious. But, some of the time, if you can wade through the first unmpteen pages of bullshit, you might find a scare or two, or a meaningful story surrounded by bloat. 
 Here are my one-sentence reviews of each story. Feel free to discuss your favorites in the comment section. 
 The Mist - Five epically-awesome stars for this tale of mist-borne monsters and flawed fathers. 
 Here There Be Tygers - Three stars for this story about toileting ""tygers"" and tasty teachers. 
 The Monkey - Two stars for this mostly mediocre, meandering monkey, because this one has never really scared me, but it sure has bored me. 
 Cain Rose Up - Three confused stars because I don't know why this story is still in publication and Rage is not. 
 Mrs. Todd's Shortcut - Four stars for what could be the inspiration for Lisey's Story, because Boo'ya Moon could very well be Mrs. Todd's escape route. 
 The Jaunt - Five stars for this tale that takes cues from The Langoliers. 
 The Wedding Gig - Four stars for this story that fits the Hard Case Crimes series better than both The 
 Colorado Kid and Joyland put together. 
 Paranoid: A Chant - I'm sure this piece is brilliant and I'm just too stupid to understand it, but yeah, one star. 
 The Raft - All the stars (Five, Six... Ten... a Hundred) for what continues to be one of my favorite stories of all time. 
 The Word Processor of the Gods - Gets three stars for being The Monkey's Paw with a happy ending. 
 The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands - Finds three stars because the boys from 249B East 35th are still telling tales, even after Emlyn McCarron told them about The Breathing Method. 
 Beachworld - Beachfront property this ain't, but one helluva four-star story it is. 
 The Reaper's Image - This three-star story seems like the inspiration for that horrible Oculus movie. 
 Nona - Gets four-stars for being darkly dubious. 
 For Owen - If I were King's kid I would expect something better than this two-star cutesy crap from my old man. 
 Survivor Type - While you'll never see Richard Pine on Food Network, his cooking gets five stars. 
 Uncle Otto's Truck - Two stars for this done-to-death concept about a killer car. 
 Morning Deliveries (Milkman #1) - One star for this outline of an idea for a possible short story. 
 Big Wheels: A Tale of the Laundry Game (Milkman #2) - If someone would like to explain this story and its predecessor to me, I might give it more than one star. 
 Gramma - Four-stars for this creepy motherfucker because the beginning is slow as hell, but that ending... *shivers* 
 The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet - This one starts even slower than Gramma but its payoff only raises it into three-star territory. 
 The Reach - Stephen King says he wants to be remembered for this four-star beauty of a story, but he's done much better, at least in my opinion he has. 
 In summation: Skeleton Crew has a few gems, but is, overall, just okay.

 I did perhaps give to much away, but the plot is generally well-known, if only because of the horror film of the same name. 
 As for the book, I have to say that the writing wasn't that good. Descriptions of the characters and places is rare, taking away from the novel's depth; and the expression is fairly commonplace, Levin is telling you a story, but he doesn't care if you live the story or not. Other than that, this is a good book. The plot is interesting, so is the dialogue (the focus on the dialogue and not the setting is to be expected from a playwright), and the denouement is excellent. I would only add that the ending proved comical instead of frightening (and I was reading it before bed!), but a book is not only defined by its ending. 
 In the end, I gave it three stars because I enjoyed it. And I would recommend it to anyone interested. It's not the exceptional masterpiece that you would expect, but it's not a bad at all.",0.0,0,34776,173532.24000000002,4.99,823,5,4,3

Then, the unspeakable: a night of chaos and carnage gives way to sunrise on a nation, and ultimately a world, forever altered.

1808,Her Fearful Symmetry,Audrey Niffenegger,2009,2009,"Six years after the phenomenal success of The Time Traveler's Wife, Audrey Niffenegger has returned with a spectacularly compelling and haunting second novel set in and around Highgate Cemetery in London.
When Elspeth Noblin dies of cancer, she leaves her London apartment to her twin nieces, Julia and Valentina. These two American girls never met their English aunt, only knew that their mother, too, was a twin, and Elspeth her sister. Julia and Valentina are semi-normal American teenagers--with seemingly little interest in college, finding jobs, or anything outside their cozy home in the suburbs of Chicago, and with an abnormally intense attachment to one another.
The girls move to Elspeth's flat, which borders Highgate Cemetery in London. They come to know the building's other residents. There is Martin, a brilliant and charming crossword puzzle setter suffering from crippling Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; Marjike, Martin's devoted but trapped wife; and Robert, Elspeth's elusive lover, a scholar of the cemetery. As the girls become embroiled in the fraying lives of their aunt's neighbors, they also discover that much is still alive in Highgate, including--perhaps--their aunt, who can't seem to leave her old apartment and life behind.

1809,Flight Behavior,Barbara Kingsolver,2012,2012,"Flight Behavior takes on one of the most contentious subjects of our time: climate change. With a deft and versatile empathy Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world.
Flight Behavior transfixes from its opening scene, when a young woman's narrow experience of life is thrown wide with the force of a raging fire. In the lyrical language of her native Appalachia, Barbara Kingsolver bares the rich, tarnished humanity of her novel's inhabitants and unearths the modern complexities of rural existence. Characters and reader alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory here, into the unsettled ground of science, faith, and everyday truces between reason and conviction.
Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen. Now, after a decade of domestic disharmony on a failing farm, she has settled for permanent disappointment but seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation with a younger man. As she hikes up a mountain road behind her house to a secret tryst, she encounters a shocking sight: a silent, forested valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand it as a cautionary miracle, but it sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists, religious leaders, and the media. The bewildering emergency draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists, opportunists, sightseers, and a striking biologist with his own stake in the outcome. As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle, Dellarobia confronts her family, her church, her town, and a larger world, in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed.
Flight Behavior takes on one of the most contentious subjects of our time: climate change. With a deft and versatile empathy Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world.",Fiction,Intermediate,8,3,13,9.75,2,3.76,58112,2.0,"I love Barbara Kingsolver. All of her books automatically go on my to-read list, because she's brilliant. One of the things I love about her is how unique her books are from one another. She writes different kind of characters in disparate environments and focuses on varying themes. I find it so impressive when authors can reinvent themselves so often. Flight Behavior is my fourth Kingsolver book. Unfortunately, unlike the others, this one failed to meet my expectations. 
 My first Kingsolver read was The Bean Trees, which centers around a girl desperate to get out of her small, hick town where most of the girls are pregnant before they even leave high school. She wants to be one of the ones to leave and never come back. Through some odd circumstances, she finds herself stuck raising a baby that's not hers, sort of falling into motherhood. The plot itself didn't have much appeal for me as a reader, but the book was utterly compelling and I loved it so much. Kingsolver's powerful writing and intriguing, quirky characters pulled me in despite myself. 
 In Flight Behavior, Kingsolver again focuses on a heroine who had dreams of escaping her hick town, but this one didn't make it. Dellarobia hoped to go to college, but wound up pregnant instead. Even worse, the baby boy died, leaving her stuck in a marriage with a man she doesn't respect and reliant on judgmental in-laws. Her unhappiness manifests itself in a wandering eye; she has had a number of crushes on men, flirted with the idea of an affair. The hook of the novel is when Dellarobia heads up the mountain to meet with one of her men and cheat on her husband. On her way, she sees the forest burning with butterflies, and interprets that as a sign from God that she needs to go back to her life and make good. 
 Dellarobia's life certainly is unfortunate, and it's such a shame that her promise was wasted on this small town, where kids only take two years of rudimentary math in school. Even the bright ones aren't given enough education to be able to get out of town. I feel for her, but I didn't connect with her or any of the other characters. In all of Kingsolver's previous works, I was held rapt in unfamiliar worlds by the power of the characters and the writing, but these characters simply failed to grab onto my heart and take hold. 
 Another problem too is that, while the writing is beautiful as always (and shows that you can not write in dialect but still achieve a southern feel), the story feels a bit like a combination of two of the Kingsolver books I'd previously read: The Bean Trees and Prodigal Summer. Revisiting old themes, while not what I know Kingsolver for, can be done well, but, in this case, it felt repetitive and less well done. 
 Flight Behavior feels like it was written not so much for the characters as to be the vehicle for a message: global warming is real and it's not just about changing temperatures. Now, of course, it's alright for books to have a moral, a message, but I don't like to feel like I'm being beat over the head with it or being talked down to. 
 The butterflies Dellarobia witnessed normally wintered in Mexico, but moved to her small town because of environmental changes and now the whole population of Monarch butterflies could be in danger of extinction. A lepidopterist comes to study them, and works with and teaches Dellarobia, highlighting her boredom with her husband and her desire for something bigger. Because of her rudimentary education, the reader receives both the scientific explanations for everything and the 'country' version, a cute little metaphor for everything that's happening. This felt a bit insulting to me, as though this setting was chosen to allow for global warming to be explained in a simplified way that the stupid disbelievers could fathom. Prodigal Summer also dealt with the importance of taking care of the environment, but did not make me feel so lectured. 
 Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh, but I'm disappointed to have not enjoyed a book by one of my favorite authors. Her writing is still gorgeous, but the book is massive, slow, and filled with a lot of minutiae about Dellarobia's life I could have done without. Surely others will appreciate this one (most of the reviews on Goodreads are highly flattering and NPR approves), but it fell flat with me.",184.0,1,4360,4316.4,0.99,1085,4,2,3

Denny is the best looking of Red and Abby's four children and the one that has caused Abby the greatest amount of worry. 
 Which was not to say that Denny was bad. He was far more generous, for instance, than the other three put together. (He traded his new bike for a kitten when Jeannie's beloved cat died.) And he didn't bully other children, or throw tantrums. But he was so close-mouthed. He had these spells of unexplained obstinacy, where his face would grow set and pinched and no one could get through to him. It seemed to be a kind of inward tantrum; it seemed his anger turned in upon itself and hardened him or froze him. Red threw up his hands when that happened and stomped off, but Abby couldn't let him be. She just had to jostle him out of it. She wanted her loved ones happy! 
 This was such an absorbing read; one might think I was reading about my own family. Every day life, every day moments, spanning three generations of the Whitshank family. As Zoeytron says in her spot on review, ""It's a quiet tale, well told."" There is no grand plot, no nail biting suspense, just a heart warming story of one family that could just as easily be your own. I was completely drawn in, compulsively reading, so in tune it seemed with everyone's thoughts and feelings and oh so reluctant for the book to end. This friends, is comfort food for the soul.

1812,Winter,Len Deighton,1988,2016,"A November morning in the 1920s finds an elderly man in his eighties walking the grounds of his Dorchester home, pondering his past and future with deep despondence. That man is the revered novelist and poet Thomas Hardy, and Christopher Nicholson's fictionalized account of the final years of the accomplished writer's life is as engrossing as it is heartbreaking.
The novel focuses on the true events that occurred around the London theater dramatization of Hardy's acclaimed novel Tess of the D'Urbervilles, including Hardy's hand-picked casting of the young, alluring Gertrude ""Gertie"" Bugler of The Hardy Players to play Tess. As plans for the play become more concrete, Hardy's interest in Gertie becomes a voyeuristic infatuation, causing him to write some of the best poems of his career. However, when Hardy's reclusive wife, Florence, catches wind of Hardy's desire for Gertie to take the London stage, a tangled web of jealously and missed opportunity ensnares all three characters-with devastating results.
Told from the perspectives of Hardy, Gertie, and Florence, Nicholson's novel perfectly captures the often-difficult juxtaposition of fledgling hopes and the unfulfilled life. With expert insight into the struggles of both Hardy and Florence, coupled with poetic yet unassuming prose, Winteris certainly on par with the novels of its central character.",Nonfiction,Famous,11,8,16,11.727272727272728,10,3.72,23,3.0,"This is an historical novel about Thomas Hardy, the famous author. In this book, Hardy is 84 years old and living in his house in the country, where he has lived for 40 years. He is living with his second wife, Florence, who is 40 years younger than him. 
 Hardy becomes besotted with Gertrude Bulger, a 25 year old girl, who plays Tess in a local adaptation of his novel into a play. He even writes her love poems, which of course, does not make Florence very happy. 
 At times the writing is very beautiful, especially when describing the English countryside or the many species of birds that inhabit it. However, there is really little or no discernible plot and the writing at times is very repetitious. Florence's desire to have the trees surrounding the house either cut back or cut down altogether must be mentioned at least a dozen times. And at one point the word beautiful is used 7 times in one short paragraph. Presumably the author did this deliberately for some reason, but I just found it very annoying. 
 In short. this is a passable novel, but would probably be of more interest to real fans of Thomas Hardy. I have to admit that I have never read any of Hardy's novels, a situation I must rectify at some point, as I would hope that they would be better than this book.",21.0,1,2889,10082.61,3.49,961,3,2,3

The novel opens with an evocation of Woolf's last days before her suicide in 1941, and moves to the stories of two modern American women who are trying to make rewarding lives for themselves in spite of the demands of friends, lovers, and family.
Clarissa Vaughan is a book editor who lives in present-day Greenwich Village; when we meet her, she is buying flowers to display at a party for her friend Richard, and ailing poet who has just won a major literary prize. Laura Brown is a housewife in postwar California who is bringing up her only son and looking for her true life outside of her stifling marriage.
With rare ease and assurance, Cunningham makes the two women's lives converge with Virginia Woolf's in an unexpected and heartbreaking way during the party for Richard.

It was beautifully written and has a somewhat unexpected (and yet unsurprising) ending. The references to Virginia Woolf are omnipresent as she also comes to life under Cunningham's pen along with Mrs Brown and ""Mrs Dalloway"". Yes, it did relight a flame in me to read the primary Woolf works (Orlando, Mrs Dalloway, To The Lighthouse, The Waves) and reminded me of the one I did read (A Room of One's Own), but still, something about it felt a little superficial. Was it the length (just 220 pages) and the relative ease with which I read it (less than 2 hours)? Or perhaps the heavily laden sentences that perhaps dipped low towards being pretentious? No, I have never seen the movie. And, yes, perhaps I should. But as a standalone novel, I have a hard time understanding why this one was chosen for the Pulitzer in 1997. Not having read either of the runner-ups (Cloudsplitter by Russel Banks about abolitionist John Brown or The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsiolver about the Belgian colonisation of the Congo), both were far longer and of considerably more depth in terms of historical scope from what I can tell.

Urging him to hang on, she forces him to remain alert by recounting the stories of their lifetime together - how they met, the precious paintings they collected together, the dark days of WWII and its effect on them and their families. Ira knows that Ruth can't possibly be in the car with him, but he clings to her words and his memories, reliving the sorrows and everyday joys that defined their marriage.

 Nicholas Sparks has always been one of my favorite author's. He was actually one of if not THE first author that I ever discovered. At one time, I couldn't get enough of his writing, and soaked up every single one of his books. Then I started dabbling with other author's and honestly haven't came back to him until now. Oh my, although I hadn't realized it until the first few minutes into the book, how did I miss him and his writing! 
 Sparks has an extraordinary talent for delivering heart-felt, heart string tugging stories that leave you feeling like weeping and laughing, all at the same time. I have always felt an amazing spark and connection when reading his books, and The Longest Ride was no different. I always get so lost in his writing, and I found myself soaring through all of the different emotions while listening to The Longest Ride. I felt a great connection to the story! 
 In the past, I have only listened to mystery/suspense novels on audio, so I was quite leery about listening to a non-mystery book on audio, so much so, that I actually put off listening to this book for several months. With this book, I learned that most genres should be okay on audio, that it's not reserved for just mystery books (and be good, at least!) I thought that the narrators, Ron McLarty and January LaVoy, fit their perspective characters perfectly. I really felt like I was listening to Ira when McLarty read! My only quirk would be that LaVoy also read the part of Dylan, so it was a little irking to hear a female try to sound like a manly cowboy! Other than that, I think that the narration of The Longest Ride was great, and if I had to rate it, would rate it at least 4-1/2 stars! 
 I feel like you can never go wrong with Nicholas Sparks, and this book left me feeling no different. It really made me feel like I've been missing a lot in the few years that it's been since I've read a Sparks book. He has a way with words and really delivers some of the best love stories ever written! His stories are impeccable and mesmerizing! And I thoroughly enjoyed reading about both sets of couples, Ira and Ruth, and their life-long love story, which was truly touching, and Sophie and Dylan, who were just beginning their adventure of their love life, where they seem destined to be together! I thought that Sparks expertly intersected the lives of these four people, and brought it altogether at the end. 
 Overall, of all the Nicholas Sparks books that I've read, that this one definitely stands out as one of the most touching stories that he's written. Most retailers compare it to The Notebook, however, I feel like The Longest Ride may even surpass the greatness of The Notebook, which I would have thought was impossible to do!

 ********** 
 A seemingly unending stream of word vomit. 
 I can think of no other way to describe this thing. 
 I really, really despised almost everything about The Corrections. I finished it solely so that I could write a horrible review and have it be valid. 
 At no single point before the last 10 pages of this 566-page monster did I feel a shred of sympathy with any of the characters. There were several moments where I thought Franzen would have been better off writing dialogue-for-the-average-Joe instead of the trumped up and out of place Dawson's Creek-esque vocabulary in almost every human interaction. His insistence on using the ""25-cent word"" at every turn made reading the story choppy at best... aggravating and unenjoyable. 
 I also couldn't help but see the author in a lot of his characters' worst personality traits. Annoying hipster-lecher I'm-better-than-capitalism-but-still-depend-on-it Chip. Whiny too-good-for-anyone Gary. Ungrateful I'm-a-bitch-but-require-all-your-love-and-attention Denise. The parents? Alfred is the only one for whom I felt any sympathy and that didn't happen until the last dregs of the book... and I think maybe even then it was a knee-jerk reaction at being so close to the book being over. Enid's issues rubbed me the wrong way for many reasons, not the least of which being that I could see my own mother in her... which means, I suppose, that Enid was probably the most well-represented character in the novel. 
 The secondary characters were almost entirely a sorry lot with personalities to the extreme in any number of directions - too smart, too stupid, too needy, too plain, too EVERYTHING. 
 I know that I'll never understand the praise this book received from critics and readers... and I'm ok with that. I do wish, however, that I could meet some of the people who relate it so easily to real life. Meeting them, perhaps, would truly terrify me.",278.0,1,825,816.75,0.99,135,2,4,2

Practically overnight the stock market has plummeted, hyperinflation has crippled commerce, and the fragile chains of supply and high-technology infrastructure have fallen. The power grids are down. Brutal rioting and looting grip every major city. The volatile era known as ""the Crunch"" has begun, and this new period in our history will leave no one untouched. In this unfamiliar environment, only a handful of individuals are equipped to survive.
Andrew Laine, a resourceful young U.S. Army officer stationed overseas in Afghanistan, wants nothing more than to return home to Bloomfield, New Mexico. With the world in turmoil and all air and sea traffic to America suspended, Laine must rely on his own ingenuity and the help of good Samaritans to reach his family. Andrew will do whatever it takes to make it home to his fiancee, no matter how difficult the circumstances.
Major Ian Doyle is a U.S. Air Force pilot sta-tioned in Arizona with his wife, Blanca. Their young daughter, Linda, is trapped in the North- eastern riots. Three teenage orphans, Shadrach, Reuben, and Matthew Phelps, have no choice but to set out on their own when their orphanage closes at the beginning of the Crunch. Then there is Ignacio Garcia, the ruthless leader of the criminal gang called La Fuerza, who will stop at nothing to amass an army capable of razing the countryside. And over everything looms the threat of a provisional government, determined to take over America and destroy the freedoms upon which it was built.
The world of Survivors is a terrifyingly familiar one. Rawles has written a novel so close to the truth, readers will forget it's fiction.

I read the whole book in two days mainly because I started skimming towards the end. Normally, I love post-apocalyptic tales and, since I'd found this author's previous non-fiction book to be fascinating, I thought I would likely enjoy this book, too. I didn't. I fully expected the writing to be mediocre, and I was okay with that as long as I got an interesting and informative story. Unfortunately, the story was filled with unbelievable characters who could do everything well and who preached at me constantly. There was no plot, just paper people running around surviving because they could shoot other people and because they were such wonderful Christians. The timeline was all screwed up, too. We, the readers, were jerked back and forth through time and space so often with so little warnings that I struggled keep track of where the story was and who I was reading about. Most of the info about surviving in a collapsed economy came down to having guns and gold or silver. Some of what was written might have been handy or interesting if I knew more about guns already, but rattling off gun names and characteristics doesn't teach me much. I perked up a little when he wrote that Magic Flash cubes can be rigged as an alarm system, but he never said how it was done, so I'm not sure how useful that was. One thing I did learn that could be useful is that most bad guys have shaved heads and tattoos. I'll make sure to watch out for that type. 
 I hate to just spout complaints about a book, but with this one it's hard to come up with something nice to say. And yet I did read it all the way through, which says something about it. It was oddly compelling and I wanted to like it. In the end, though, the only thing that kept me from throwing the book at the wall was that I didn't want to wake up my sleeping man.",14.0,1,5238,5185.62,0.99,462,5,3,2

Life is hellish for all the slaves but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood - where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned and, though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.
In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor - engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven - but the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. Even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.
As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroadis at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.",Fiction,Excellent,37,1,16,7.432432432432432,11,4.03,86839,3.0,"I could not get into this book, and that makes me feel like there is something wrong with me.

Who will fall to Cujo before the disease he carries finishes him off? 
 I'm just going to come out and say it. Most of this book feels like filler to me. I think King took what was potentially an award winning tale of terror and jammed as much padding into it as he could until it was one of his shorter novels. Basically, it's a fantastic short story wrapped in a soap opera I couldn't give two shits about. 
 That being said, Cujo is a really powerful book in places. While I didn't care about a lot of things on the periphery, the core of it is pretty terrifying and heart-wrenching. No one wants their beloved family pet to turn on them and a rabid dog trapping a woman and her child in a car for DAYS is damn horrifying. As opposed to most of his menaces, Cujo is all too plausible. 
 The writing is good and the ending packs a huge punch. I sure didn't see that coming. It was like being kicked in the balls after you're already lying on the ground after being shot in the heart.

~from the back cover",Fiction,Intermediate,8,3,14,7.625,5,3.74,537,2.0,"What if you had the chance to live your life again and again, until you finally got it right? 
 Ursula Todd is born in a snowstorm in England in 1910 but dies before she can take her first breath. During that same snowstorm she was born again and lives to tell the tale; again and again. Life after Life tells the story of Ursula's lives, as with each new life she makes small changes that send her on a completely different path. 
 I feel like I'm the only person on the planet that thought this book was overhyped and over rated. Sure Kate Atkinson has this trippy ability to create this bleak world while still managing to add some wit and compassion but it wasn't the writing that was at fault. The premise of the book makes it sound really good but let's face it; it is just Groundhog Day in disguise. The book is clever, but it tries too hard to be clever and it didn't really turn out the way it should have; for me anyway. This book is getting so many rave reviews, I feel like I am a black sheep just telling people it did not work. 
 As I said before, there is nothing wrong with the writing; Kate Atkinson has created this lyrical narrative and I did find myself being swept away in the words. I even felt like at times I was reading this book without thinking about what was happening; a few times I had to stop and process before continuing. I almost found myself not noticing a death and Ursula's life starting again and that could have got me completely lost. I did feel like Kate Atkinson did however overdo the twists and it turned out to be a roundabout way to retell the same story over and over again with different outcomes. This could have worked; and it sounds like it worked for many people but I sadly wasn't one of them. 
 I wonder if Kate Atkinson was trying something different and experimental where she could play with the character's death and life, explore the concept of life's choices and their consequences but because there were no real penalty to Ursula's life I wonder if it really worked? Do you ever have deja vu? (I don't think so, but I could check with the kitchen) Life after Life just seems to repeat the same scenes, some readers might gain a sense of familiarity and for me it just felt like I wasn't getting anywhere. 
 Life after Life is the kind of book you should probably read in a real cold climate; the snowy, dark and sometimes bleakness of the novel seems to call for it. Maybe read snuggled up on a dark winters night and don't forget your booties 'cause it's cooooold out there today (It's coooold out there every day. What is this, Miami Beach?). It is just the book that would work better in the cold; though it is never cold here in Townsville, maybe that's why it didn't work for me. 
 I really wanted to enjoy this book; I will try another Kate Atkinson novel because I really think she has a great style. Just so happened Life after Life was not for me and I know people loved this book and will probably complain about this review but at least it was just an excuse to put some Groundhog Day quotes into something. This book has had so many positive reviews so maybe it is just me, if the book sounds like something you'd like then don't let this review stop you, is it too early for flapjacks?

What its vivid evocation of the fear and loneliness at the heart of a child's yearning, and the tragedy of its fulfillment. The Bluest Eyeremains one of Tony Morrisons's most powerful, unforgettable novels- and a significant work of American fiction.",Fiction,Intermediate,11,3,13,7.818181818181818,11,3.99,111515,5.0,"...his mother did not like him to play with niggers. She had explained to him the difference between colored people and niggers. They were easily identifiable. Colored people were neat and quiet; niggers were dirty and loud...The line between colored and nigger was not always clear; subtle and telltale signs threatened to erode it, and the watch had to be constant. 
 While I was not the biggest fan of Morrison's style in this novel, I did fully appreciate the dagger-sharp insight that she brought to the color caste system that is so prevalent in African-American culture, even today. Her dialogue rang so true, I could hear it coming directly out of my mother's mouth, my grandmother's mouth, and those of all of the women who've ever filled our kitchens with raucous communal fun and glum communal tragedy alike. Her use of the Dick & Jane children's books, used for decades to teach children to read (SEEMOTHERMOTHERISVERYNICEMOTHERWILLYOUPLAYWITHJANEMOTHERLAUGHSLAUGHMOTHERLAUGHLA) created a chilling, ironic and staggering contrast between the lives of the whites and those of the blacks in this novel. Shirley Temple, Mary Jane candies, and Jean Harlow hairstyles - you'll find the delicacy of all of them here, both in these characters' reality and in metaphor. While the truth and injustices here were often sobering to read, they were filled with too much truth to rightfully deny or turn away from. 
 I could spend hours discussing this novel. I could quote from it all day, but I won't do that, because the entire read was poignant and so crisply aware of the color line - the how and the why - that there is no one point that can overshadow another in the message that these words aimed to send. This novel is older than I am, and yet it still rings with such verity, with such biting truth and reality. With The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison cut open the existence of both internalized and externalized racism in America and laid it bare and exposed at our feet. For that, she deserves nothing but reverence and applause, so she will always have that from me. 
 Anyone who's ever been in doubt of a color line in Black America should read this book. Anyone who's ever questioned, ""But why can't I say those words when you say them all the time? But why do you still believe that racism exists? Why can't you just get over it - the past is the past?"" should read this book.

 A chance meeting between the school's drug dealer and an innocent, sheltered student came about because of a lost doll. Had Anna not found the doll, she would have carried on her life as usual. There would be no danger, no mystery, no killing for her to know about. One might say that finding the doll was the worst thing that could have happened to her. I would disagree. 
 Abel is a broken human being. He's broken to the point of ill repair, yet Anna still sees something in him that's worth saving. As we see Abel through Anna's eyes, we are shown just how much a person will endure in order to spare a life so precious to him - the life of a tiny little girl in a pink jacket. 
 Abel and Anna bond through time shared as Abel spins wonderful fairytales into existence for his younger sister. Real life becomes the backdrop for the fantasy. Characters in reality become characters in the story. A mystery starts to unfold as characters in the story become bigger players in crimes which start taking place in the real world. Who is the killer? Why does Abel seem to have so much to hide? Why are other people interested in what Abel and Anna are up to? 
 I can't divulge much without going into spoiler territory. The Storyteller is so beautifully written. The depth of character and layers of detail are heart-breakingly intricate. After I finished, I was left with a few different emotions. Anger and sadness were probably the two most prominent, but I can't say that I have any regrets reading this book. I had a hard time putting my reader down because the story of Abel and Anna was such a pull. 
 As for the character flaws...I suppose I should address those. Both Abel and Anna disappointed me in a way because of their actions, yet I felt as if their actions made them more real. Abel was abused, so he had no other experience to draw from in learning how to interact with others. Anna had an empty but satisfactory life and she craved more than her own existence inside of a pretty box. Abel was able to give her something she'd never had before and because of this, she was quick to forgive at times when others wouldn't. Right or wrong, I understood why.",56.0,1,435,430.65,0.99,239,2,2,2

Samantha, though, is one of the ""lucky"" associates. She's offered an opportunity to work at a legal aid clinic for one year without pay, after which there would be a slim chance that she'd get her old job back.

Suddenly, though, Misty finds her artistic talent returning as she begins a period of compulsive painting. Inspired but confused by this burst of creativity, she soon finds herself a pawn in a larger conspiracy that threatens to cost hundreds of lives.

And sometimes I can't help but wonder, what if THAT is what exactly Palahniuk wants the readers to feel about his works? Feel challenged by it, dislike it, feel disgusted or insulted by it--all of these by hurling the naked truths of human nature to the face of people in the harshest possible way? 
 My first Palahniuk book is Choke, and I was sort of culture shocked when I read it--a multitude of f-bombs being dropped from heavenly heights, sexually explicit situations, bitter but truthful ruminations about life. Completely different from the books I've been reading--and that's saying something because I usually go for the ""dark side"" of literature. I thought Choke would already build my literary panoply when it comes to his works. But I was wrong--Diary might not lie on the opposite side of the spectrum when leveled with his other works, but it's a new account of insane despair that I'm not really used to. 
 Diary is a story about art,and, well, the crazy reality that most desperate people live. It also tackles a Marxist concept but viewed from a strangely twisted angle. It is written mostly in the second person point of view and in the format of a 'coma diary' written by the female protagonist, Misty Wilmot. There is no subtlety in Palahniuk's style of writing, and when what he writes stabs, it stabs straight to the heart and conscience. It gets under your skin most of the time. 
 I will not detail everything, but I just want to say that this is a satisfying read. The Palahniuk ""flavor"" is exotic and dark, and it's the sort of taste that most readers will only refer to as ""poison"". If only everyone reads closely, the antidote to the venom of reality that Palahniuk presents in this work is also present--right between the lines.",51.0,1,2862,25729.38,8.99,1006,3,2,3

This cloud is self-sustaining and self-reproducing. It is intelligent and learns from experience. For all practical purposes, it is alive.
It has been programmed as a predator. It is evolving swiftly, becoming more deadly with each passing hour.
Every attempt to destroy it has failed.
And we are the prey.",Fiction,Intermediate,15,1,15,5.9375,10,3.72,133370,4.0,"This is my first Michael Crichton read, and I loved it. Prey is told in first person by Jack Foreman, a stay-at-home dad, who suspects his wife, Julia, of having an affair. Julia, a vice president at Xymos, a molecular manufacturing company, works late night, and one night she doesn't even come home at all. Eventually, Julia shows Jack a video demonstration of what they're working on - a cloud of nanoparticles, which works as one big camera. Then something goes wrong at the facility and Jack is invited by Ricky, his former employee to come and help fix the problem. A cloud of nanoparticles -- micro-robots -- has escaped from the laboratory, and he has to get it back. But this cloud is self-reproducing, intelligent; it evolves quickly, and is now a threat. There at the facility Jack learns the truth about his wife, the nanoparticles, and his former co-workers. 
 The book has a slow start. Jacks suspects his wife of having an affair and he's taking time on deciding what to do because he isn't very sure yet. He doesn't want a divorce; he wants to keep his family together, and his kids, always biting each other, are not helping matters. He can't get a job; he's rejected wherever he applies because of a 'got fired for doing the right thing' incident in his former workplace. 
 And then the story kicks off when he's asked to come and solve a problem at the plant. Then comes the action, the suspense, and of course the thrill. You wouldn't want to be anywhere near the swarms - those molecular robots. They're dangerous, they hurt the skin, and they can get into your nasal cavity, suffocating you. They kill wildlife as well as humans. Jack has to stop it, no matter what. Because he designed the program used in modeling the swarms. But he can't do it himself. There are other notable characters there like the quiet, strong and beautiful Mae; devious Ricky; loud-farting/non-stop talking Charley; and of course Jack's beautiful and secretive wife, Julia. Some of these characters help to achieve the goal, while others stand in Jack's way. There are lots of deaths in the end. 
 I loved the technological and biological details the author wove in the various part of the story. It's blended well into the narrative and doesn't cause any distraction. Even though I found some of them boring or overly done, I still learnt something from them. 
 The five-paged bibliography at the end of the book shows well the thorough research undertaken by the author for this book. It is a book worth reading, and I'll certainly read more titles from Crichton. I have my mind on Jurassic Park next. Although I've seen the movie, I'd still love to experience the book side of it. 
 I recommend this book to any sci-fi and techno-thriller lover. If you like the science-goes-wrong genre, then this is the book for you.

One of the most revered novelists of our time - a brilliant chronicler of Native-American life - Louise Erdrich returns to the territory of her bestselling, Pulitzer Prize finalist The Plague of Doves with The Round House, transporting readers to the Ojibwe reservation in North Dakota. It is an exquisitely told story of a boy on the cusp of manhood who seeks justice and understanding in the wake of a terrible crime that upends and forever transforms his family.
Riveting and suspenseful, arguably the most accessible novel to date from the creator of Love Medicine, The Beet Queen, and The Bingo Palace, Erdrich's The Round House is a page-turning masterpiece of literary fiction - at once a powerful coming-of-age story, a mystery, and a tender, moving novel of family, history, and culture.",Fiction,Intermediate,12,12,16,14.25,14,3.91,69142,4.0,"Before this, I'd only read Erdrich's children's fiction.

One of the things in the book is that the teen characters really like TNG. Although I was a bit annoyed that Troi's name was misspelled... you'd think an editor would have caught that. 
 Anyway this is a family tragedy as seen through the eyes of a 13-year old boy. Erdrich portrays both positives and negatives of life on the reservation, giving the non-Native reader a peek into that world.

While you're waiting for that to happen, try reading the vastly more intelligent novel on which the movie was based. The broad lines of the plot remain the same: A research team deep in the jungle disappears after a mysterious and grisly gorilla attack. A subsequent team, including a sign-language-speaking simian named Amy, follows the original team's tracks only to be subjected to more mysterious and grisly gorilla attacks. If you can look past the breathless treatment of '80s technology, like voice-recognition software and 256K RAM modules (the book was written in 1980), you'll find the same smart use of science and edge-of-your-seat suspense shared by Crichton's other work. --Paul Hughes

Dawson Cole, one of the main characters, comes from a family of violent lawbreakers and thugs, while Amanda Collier, the other main character, comes from a wealthy, upstanding family. You get the picture: star-crossed lovers whose personal circumstances ultimately short-circuit their relationship. Great stuff, huh, and vintage Sparks! Then the story and plot begin to unravel for me. 
 First of all, there is the ""ghost"" that keeps showing up at critical times in Dawson's life. This metaphysical ""spirit"" gave the story a cheesy quality and I found it hard to take it seriously. I mean after all, this is not a ""Twilight"" novel! Then there were the letters that Tuck (the deceased friend whose funeral caused Dawson and Amanda to be brought back together again) wrote to Dawson and Amanda. The purpose of the letters is made moot because of the book's contrived ending. Why include these letters in the story if they had absolutely no bearing in the book's finale? It doesn't make any sense! 
 Finally, Spark's, once again, has the chance to have one of his novels end well, yet decides, also once again, to end it tragically. Yes, I know that life isn't an endless series of ""happily ever after"" moments...but neither is it an endless series of tragedies either. You'd think Sparks would have learned to mix it up a bit with the endings to his novels, because he is becoming predictable and to me, that means boring.

Basically, it's a fantastic short story wrapped in a soap opera I couldn't give two shits about. 
 That being said, Cujo is a really powerful book in places. While I didn't care about a lot of things on the periphery, the core of it is pretty terrifying and heart-wrenching. No one wants their beloved family pet to turn on them and a rabid dog trapping a woman and her child in a car for DAYS is damn horrifying. As opposed to most of his menaces, Cujo is all too plausible. 
 The writing is good and the ending packs a huge punch. I sure didn't see that coming. It was like being kicked in the balls after you're already lying on the ground after being shot in the heart.

It is also the story of Dr. Larch's favorite orphan, Homer Wells, who is never adopted.",Fiction,Intermediate,21,1,14,5.761904761904762,6,4.1,128,5.0,"I knew going in that a central theme of ""Cider House Rules"" is abortion. What I wasn't expecting was how utterly non-didactic the novel is: Irving doesn't want to convince you to think of this issue in any one way. He wants to show you what different people with different experiences and baggage think about it, so that in turn, you can refine the way you look at this very complicated issue. Regardless of your stance, you will learn something about how the other side feels. This is what a great novel does: it opens your mind and your heart, it creates compassion for something you never thought of and it makes you look at the world in a slightly different way. 
 This was my first John Irving novel and I now completely understand why he is sometimes referred to as the American Dickens. His characters are ordinary people who have extraordinary lives. And in this book, the characters have the same sort of wonderfully quirky names that I would expect from good old Charlie! The story of every one of them is so lovingly drawn that you feel as close to them as if they were members of your family by the end of the book. They are all lovably flawed, sometimes foolish and sometimes selfless but always viscerally human. Irving somehow makes them feel more real than some actual people I know. 
 Dr. Wilbur Larch delivers babies, but he also delivers mothers: having seen desperate young women die because of the lack of legally available medical assistance, he is the pro-choice character who will not hesitate to defy the law to save women. Homer Wells is an orphan of the St. Clouds orphanage where Dr. Larch works. He was never adopted, and as he grew up, was progressively groomed by the doctor to be his successor. But one day he realizes that, as an unwanted child who never knew his mother, he would have ended up as one more scraped foetus had abortion been legal. He is, understandably, pro-life and refuses to perform abortions, even if he believes they should be legal. One day, a young couple comes to St. Clouds to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, and as they leave to go back to their little coastal town, Homer decides to go with them to see what else there is in the world besides his small orphanage and finds himself working in an apple orchard. In this orchard, he will learn many things about love, life, friendship and that sometimes doing bad things for good reasons is not a crime. 
 Of course, there is so much more to it that I can reasonably summarize in a Goodreads review. The prose is rich, almost musical in its cadence and a bittersweet humour brightens what could have been a very gloomy setting. I know some readers might get exasperated by the whole ""In other parts of the world, XYZ; here in St. Clouds..."" but I absolutely loved it. It gave the book this old-fashioned storytelling vibe that made me feel warm and cosy in a way only the very best stories can accomplish. I've come to think of this novel as that warm, spicy mug of mulled wine I like to sit with on cold fall evenings: it's comforting and seems to warm me up from the inside out. While abortion is an important topic in this story, it's a mistake to think that this is all the book is about. ""The Cider House Rules"" is about family - in every possible meaning of the word - choices, the living by and breaking of rules, inclusion, growing up... Just like a very good classic, you will find new things to think about every time you pick it up. 
 It's a beautifully written and deeply moving novel that I recommend to everyone. The movie is sweet but I feel like it fails to capture the depth of the characters and the multiple layers of meaning of their story (not to mention that the last third of the story is butchered). If you've only ever seen the film and enjoyed it, give the book a chance.",1.0,0,570,1134.3,1.99,186,2,4,5
1865,The Magicians,Lev Grossman,2009,2009,"A thrilling and original coming-of- age novel about a young man practicing magic in the real worldQuentin Coldwater is brilliant but miserable. A senior in high school, he's still secretly preoccupied with a series of fantasy novels he read as a child, set in a magical land called Fillory. Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery.He also discovers all the other things people learn in college: friendship, love, sex, booze, and boredom. Something is missing, though. Magic doesn't bring Quentin the happiness and adventure he dreamed it would. After graduation he and his friends make a stunning discovery: Fillory is real. But the land of Quentin's fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he could have imagined. His childhood dream becomes a nightmare with a shocking truth at its heart.At once psychologically piercing and magnificently absorbing, The Magicians boldly moves into uncharted literary territory, imagining magic as practiced by real people, with their capricious desires and volatile emotions. Lev Grossman creates an utterly original world in which good and evil aren't black and white, love and sex aren't simple or innocent, and power comes at a terrible price.",Fiction,Novice,1,9,9,9.0,13,3.48,45,3.0,"I'm torn, I finished it, which all told means I didn't think it was that bad.

 The main character was not that interesting to me. I'm not big on whiners, I have a 9 year old boy in the house I don't need to read about them I live it, and I felt like he was a big whiner. 
 Not entirely true it didn't feel that bad in the first part of the book (aka Book 1) but once he left school, well blah. He had a bit in the middle that I felt like he might redeem himself, but not so much. 
 Then the ending left me annoyed, I kept thinking if he doesn't bring back Julia at some point I'm gonna be pissed, why have the character, then he does but in the last few paragraphs.

1867,Firefly Lane,Kristin Hannah,2008,2013,"In the turbulent summer of 1974, Kate Mularkey has accepted her place at the bottom of the eighth-grade social food chain. Then, to her amazement, the ""coolest girl in the world"" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become TullyandKate. Inseparable.
So begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.
From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness.
Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend. . . .
For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,13,13,13.0,3,4.04,73,5.0,"Best friends forever (BFF), Kate and Tully are there for each other since one specific night back in 1974. This story of this relationship lasts over three decades, and their friendship exists despite time and distance, through thick and thin, despite boyfriends and husbands. Yet, one event severs the friendship nearly forever. 
 Kate is the introvert, preferring to read; Tully is the extrovert, trying to prove to herself that she is lovable, and they meet somewhere in the middle, knowing each other's secrets, hurts, and fears. With the idea that they share a passion for the same thing, they choose a similar career path...at least at first, but the heart wants what it wants and secretly they eventually want different things and choose a different path in life. 
 This is also a story of mothers and daughters: Tully's mother, Katie's mother, and Marah Rose, Katie's daughter. Profound, redemptive, and heartbreaking this story gets to the heart of what it means to love unconditionally, or not. To love people at their best and worst and still accept them for themselves. 
 Be forewarned: it is a tearjerker, yet there are more moments of laughter and joy. 
 For anyone with a friendship that lasts through the years (this reader kept being reminded of the continuing friendship of my own sister Connie and her friend Teri), this may be a story to enjoy. 
 Furthermore, this reader realized while I am a few years older than the main characters, all the pop culture references particularly the music and fads/fashions are straight out of my lifetime (the soundtrack of my adult life).",1.0,0,645,3218.55,4.99,171,2,1,5

Their three children--teenage aspiring model Samantha, pre-med student Scott, and entertainment lawyer Allegra--are successful and happy. Allegra, as an attorney to the stars, has a career that consumes so much of her energy that she has little time for a private life--until a chance encounter with a New York writer turns her life upside down. Suddenly, she finds herself planning a wedding at her parents' Bel Air home.
As preparations begin, the chaos of last-minute arrangements, surprise announcements and ever-increasing anxiety brings out both the best and the worst in everyone. But while couples in each generation of the Steinberg family struggle with broken vows and new hopes, the real meaning of Allegra's wedding emerges. It is a bridge between the past and the future, an opportunity for reconciliation, forgiveness and new hope for the future--as weddings often are for us all.",Fiction,Intermediate,8,1,15,7.714285714285714,6,3.73,5133,4.0,"This is a typical Danielle Steel novel. I hate to say it, but she does have a sort of ""formula"", or ""style"", for her books, for the most part. I do, however, enjoy reading her books occasionally, in spite of this. The Wedding revolves around Allegra Steinberg, and her Hollywood family. It is really a whirlwind of a book, one major event after another just keeps on happening to Allegra, her family, or one of her clients (Allegra is an entertaiment attorney). It is rather fast paced for the most part, which to me, is pretty typical for a DS novel. I have to say, so much of this is rather unrealistic, the fact that so many major things keep happening, no one person in real life could possibly have all these kinds of things going on in their life. To me, this book has a soap opera feel to it, but I enjoy soap operas, so for me, this was a fairly good read, hence the four star rating (I'm actually giving it 3.75 stars, but you can't indicate that here).

 Crichton-mode actived! 
 ;) 
 So, my next novel had to be by Michael Crichton! 
 I went to the bookstore and this one was the first book that I checked and after reading the premise, I found it promising. ;) 
 So, I bought it and started to read it. 
 WoW!!!!!!! 
 Since the beginning I was in shock amalgamated with happiness since the style and mood of the novel was astonishing good. (Of course, by then I hadn't read yet The Andromeda Strain, so the idea of gathering a group of expert scientist to deal with something alien was something new for me :P ) 
 I don't know if happens to you, that sometimes if you are reading a novel that it hasn't being made into a film yet (I read the novel like 5 years before to be poorly adapted to a movie) sometimes I imagined some actor or actress to ""play"" the role of the character in my mind, an amusing thing was by then, in 1993, Sharon Stone was in hype due films like ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Sliver"", so when I imagined some actress to fill my image of Dr. Beth Halperin, I thought in Sharon Stone that she eventually got the role! 
 Honest to God! True story! 
 Curiously, 5 years later, Sharon Stone wasn't in hype anymore so, knowing that she was casted in the role that I pictured in my mind was amusing but odd at the same time. 
 I didn't picture Dustin Hoffman for the role of Dr. Goodman, no offense to Mr. Hoffman, which is an actor that I admired a lot, but I thought in Sean Connery for that character. 
 Anyway, the film was a big dissapointment for me since it was very poor adaptation to such excellent book, so if you ever watched the film and you didn't like it, don't worry, that's normal, 
 but please 
 , if that's the reason that you haven't read this novel yet, 
 please go and read it! 
 (Of course, if you have the luck of not having watched the film, please, PLEASE, don't watch it!) 
 I can assure you that the novel is way, way, 
 WAY 
 , better in infinite ways than that mediocre film. 
 I already mentioned the style and mood of the book, I just want to take the topic again to mention that it was a thrilling experience, since you feel that the story is taken very seriously from the scientific angle. 
 All the journey and process of exploring the alien ship is brilliant, you feel that you are there, down in the bottom in the ocean with them, walking with them. 
 There is a major spoiler in this book, that I won't comment here, don't worry, but please avoid at all costs to know that spoiler if you choose to read the book, since it's that kind of spoilers that if you already knew it before of reading the book, simply you will ruin all the fun of actually reading the book and making the investigation along with the scientist group. 
 If you like sci-fi book and/or techno-thriller novels, this is a 
 GREAT 
 option.

1879,The Shell Seekers,Rosamunde Pilcher,1988,1987,"Set in London and Cornwall from World War II to the present, Rosamunde Pilcher tells the story of the Keeling family, and of the passions and heartbreak that have held them together for three generations. The family centers around Penelope, and it is her love, courage, and sense of values that determine the course of all their lives,
One of Penelope's most treasured possessions is The Shell Seekers, which her father painted and left her as a remembrance and a legacy. It is this painting that symbolizes to Penelope the ties between the generations. It is the link between the past, the present, and the future. But it is the fate of this painting that just may tear the family apart....
Rosamunde Pilcher's writing demonstrates a deep sensitivity to human frailties, desires, and joys. She weaves a story that bursts with emotion, so involving it is impossible to put down. The world she creates and opens up to you becomes a place you feel comfortable, a place you can't wait to return to, a place you will never forget.",Fiction,Excellent,47,6,15,10.340425531914894,11,4.13,219,5.0,"""The most ordinary of prospects caused her to stop and stare. The last of the leaves dropped from the trees, and the bare branches made lace against pale skies. Sun after rain turned cobbled streets blue as fish scales, dazzling to the eye. Autumn winds, whipping the bay to a scud of white-caps, brought with them, not cold, but a surging sense of vitality..."" 
 Penelope Keeling knows how to live life to the fullest and I absolutely adore her! She grasps those things that matter most in life - the comfort of a home, the security of a loving mother, the laughter of friends and family, the feel of soil and the beauty of the outdoors, the enticing smells of home-cooked meals, and the allure of a splendid painting. When I come across a character in one of my books that touches me and makes me want to re-examine my own life, then I know I have found a gem. 
 Of course, we're all familiar with the phrase ""don't judge a book by its cover"". Unfortunately, I have been guilty of that offense in the past and no less so with this book. I have seen Rosamunde Pilcher's novels in bookstores and libraries and have admittedly walked right on by due to their overly feminine and botanic covers. I didn't think they were ""my sort of book"". However, I decided to give this one a try when I discovered some trusted Goodreads friends were reading this. Well, thank goodness I did - such a true delight! At the outset, we learn that Penelope is a sixty-four-year old widow that has had a surprise glimpse at her own mortality. We are introduced to her three adult children - Nancy, Olivia and Noel - as well as others that have touched her life at some point or another - her treasured mother and father, an ill-suited husband, a loyal friend, a devoted lover, a grieving young woman and a secretive yet trustworthy gardener. Each character is drawn with such depth and clarity that I felt I really knew each and every one of them. The title of this novel, The Shell Seekers, derives from a painting given to Penelope by her father, the prominent artist Lawrence Stern. When the now deceased Lawrence Stern's works of art become much sought-after, the value of this and other pieces increases significantly. Each of Penelope's children have their own thoughts about what should be done with this and other works in their mother's possession. What they desire reveals to us much about each of them, their innermost substance. As with real people, what we see is not all pretty. Pilcher has the gift of depicting riveting family dynamics. ""Family rows are like car accidents. Every family thinks, 'It couldn't happen to us,' but it can happen to everybody. The only way to avoid them is to drive with the greatest care and have much consideration for others."" 
 Penelope makes a journey to Cornwall, both in spirit and literally, where she sweeps us along to revel in the landscape and her own cherished memories. I loved every minute of this visit and will miss my time spent with Penelope. Heart-warming, memorable, and a bit of a tear-jerker, The Shell Seekers is a treasure I won't soon forget. I am quite pleased that several more Rosamunde Pilcher novels now grace my bookshelf with their blossoming covers and their promise of comfort and pure reading satisfaction.",135.0,1,35424,176765.76,4.99,811,5,3,2

Judge Raymond Fawcett has just become number five.
Who is the Racketeer? And what does he have to do with the judge's untimely demise? His name, for the moment, is Malcolm Bannister. Job status? Former attorney. Current residence? The Federal Prison Camp near Frostburg, Maryland.
On paper, Malcolm's situation isn't looking too good these days, but he's got an ace up his sleeve. He knows who killed Judge Fawcett, and he knows why.

He had spent the last year in a lonely, private purgatory, following the death of his beloved, Merrin Williams, who was raped and murdered under inexplicable circumstances. A mental breakdown would have been the most natural thing in the world. But there was nothing natural about the horns, which were all too real.
Once the righteous Ig had enjoyed the life of the blessed: born into privilege, the second son of a renowned musician and younger brother of a rising late-night TV star, he had security, wealth, and a place in his community.

But Merrin's death damned all that. The only suspect in the crime, Ig was never charged or tried. And he was never cleared. In the court of public opinion in Gideon, New Hampshire, Ig is and always will be guilty because his rich and connected parents pulled strings to make the investigation go away.

The summer that Nixon resigns, six teenagers at a summer camp for the arts become inseparable. Decades later the bond remains powerful, but so much else has changed. In The Interestings, Wolitzer follows these characters from the height of youth through middle age, as their talents, fortunes, and degrees of satisfaction diverge.
The kind of creativity that is rewarded at age fifteen is not always enough to propel someone through life at age thirty; not everyone can sustain, in adulthood, what seemed so special in adolescence. Jules Jacobson, an aspiring comic actress, eventually resigns herself to a more practical occupation and lifestyle. Her friend Jonah, a gifted musician, stops playing the guitar and becomes an engineer. But Ethan and Ash, Jules's now-married best friends, become shockingly successful--true to their initial artistic dreams, with the wealth and access that allow those dreams to keep expanding. The friendships endure and even prosper, but also underscore the differences in their fates, in what their talents have become and the shapes their lives have taken.
Wide in scope, ambitious, and populated by complex characters who come together and apart in a changing New York City, The Interestings explores the meaning of talent; the nature of envy; the roles of class, art, money, and power; and how all of it can shift and tilt precipitously over the course of a friendship and a life.",Fiction,Intermediate,4,11,13,11.75,13,3.54,77741,4.0,"I'm not certain what 44 looks like, other than what I'm presented with in the mirror each morning. The Social Security Life Expectancy calculator informs me that I've lived half my anticipated span. The tired maxim encourages me not to think of the years in my life, but the life in my years. 
 Now that I'm marooned in middle age for a spell, I've been thinking an awful lot about the life in the years ahead of and behind me. Have I achieved something of value in my work, my relationships? Is what I do enough to sustain me intellectually and emotionally for the next forty-four years? Do I measure up to my peers? Am I happy? Am I interesting? This quest for fulfillment and self-actualization is the premise of Meg Wolitzer's sprawling, cracking good novel The Interestings. 
 In the summer of '74, Julie Jacobson, a middle class average achiever from a non-descript upstate New York town, earns a spot at an exclusive arts camp in New England. She is selected to enter the inner circle of the five coolest kids in camp, each a precocious, urbane specimen bred in the hipness of New York City. Julie becomes Jules and we follow her and those five other teenagers for the next thirty years. 
 Jules is obsessed with the self-dubbed The Interestings -the talented and/or privileged people to whom she devotes so much emotional energy. The cult of personalities made me squeamish at times--I wanted her to walk away from the past and create a life of her own. But her devotion to their supposed ideal reveals one of the truths of human nature--we hang onto the golden coming-of-age memories, hoping those few perfect moments of childhood will carry us through the disappointment of growing up. 
 It took me a long time to track on the Jules Vibe. I never quite believed in her intimate friendship with Ash Wolf, the faerie child around whose axis the group of friends spins. Nor did I fully embrace Ethan's constancy of passion for her. She just wasn't, ironically, that interesting. Even her physical presence remained shadowy for me. The others I could picture perfectly--lumbering, awkward Ethan; delicate, perfectly formed Ash; bombshell Cathy; finely etched, beautiful Jonah with his sweep of long, dark hair; golden God turned bloated addict Goodman. But Jules, other than her unruly hair, remained indistinct. 
 Yet, as she matured, growing into her role as friend, counselor, wife and mother, Jules begins to take shape. She became the character I most wanted to get stuck in the middle of a book with. Which is the genius of Wolitzer's narrative--the novel's most enigmatic character becomes its core strength. 
 Not that you'll get stuck in this book. Despite its length and scope, The Interestings impels the reader with sparkling dialogue and description. I did tread water with some lengthy expository and flashback episodes, but it easily becomes one of those books you just can't set down. 
 If you say you don't compare your external successes and failures (e.g. material possessions, presumed income, job, weight, health, marital status, kids' college admissions, job prospects) with your circle of peers, I say ""more power to you."" Forgive me if I don't believe you. Meg Wolitzer probably wouldn't believe you, either. It's what we do, we flawed, insecure, fickle humans. We're hard-wired to want what we ain't got. 
 But we can learn to accept what we've been given. Do The Interestings? Read and find out. 
 I'm five years too young to fall within the brackets of the Baby Boomer generation (cut-off birth year is 1964), and ten years younger than the main characters of The Interestings, but I can relate to many of the novel's cultural reference points and Jules Jacobson's feeling that she just missed out on the badge of cultural honor bestowed those who came of age in the late '60s. 
 I've walked away from traditional success a few times, always choosing the interesting over expected. Perhaps because I fear the fall from lofty heights will be harder to recover from than the soft bounce of relative obscurity. Perhaps I'm just lazy.

Meticulously trained by Dr. Larch, Homer assists in the former, but draws the line at the latter. Then a young man brings his beautiful fiancee to Dr. Larch for an abortion, and everything about the couple beckons Homer to the wide world outside the orphanage ...",Fiction,Intermediate,21,1,14,5.761904761904762,6,4.1,321,4.0,"Hey! I just popped my John Irving cherry with The Cider House Rules! 
 Something strange happened midway through reading The Cider House Rules, my first John Irving book.* I found myself completely immersed in its world. 
 What's strange is that for the first couple hundred pages, I didn't particularly believe in this early 20th century Dickensian fable about orphans, surrogate families, an ether-addicted abortionist and the arbitrariness of some rules. But Irving's storytelling skills eventually won me over. His prose is persuasive. 
 Homer Wells is raised in an orphanage in the isolated town of St. Cloud's, Maine. Although he's been placed with families four separate times, something has always gone wrong with his adoptions, and so he continually ends up back at the orphanage, where he eventually assists Dr. Wilbur Larch in his unusual obi/gyn practice. 
 Women come to St. Cloud's to either give their children up for adoption or have the doctor terminate their pregnancies. When Homer is old enough to understand the latter, he decides to stop helping with those procedures. And when Wally Worthington and Candy Kendall, a glamorous young couple who've come to terminate their own unexpected pregnancy, tell Homer about the apple orchards back home near the ocean, he leaves with them, planning to stay just for a week or so to learn about orchards for the orphanage. 
 The book essentially recounts Homer's coming-of-age. Out in the big bad world, he realizes that evil and temptation exist, and that moral choices aren't so black and white. Having grown up in an old-fashioned world, presided over by Larch and Nurses Edna (who's secretly in love with Larch) and Angela, he's been insulated. Choices seem so much easier in the books that he used to read to the orphans: Dickens's Great Expectations and David Copperfield (for the boys), and Jane Eyre for the girls. 
 In a sense, Homer sets out to realize his own great expectations, working in the orchards that Wally's mother runs, falling in love with Candy and forging a lasting friendship with Wally. Meanwhile, Dr. Larch, who's addicted to inhaling ether, is getting older; the board of the orphanage is looking to replace him. Will Homer eventually return? 
 Anyone who's only seen the film version will be surprised by a plotline about another major character, Melony, an orphan who initiates Homer into sex and feels betrayed by his departure. She's determined to track him down, but her motivations remain vague. Revenge? Jealousy? Again: because Irving is such a smooth and skilled writer, the Melony sections are always readable and provide a bit of tension in a plot that can sometimes feel loose. 
 A few other quibbles: Homer's decision to leave with Candy and Wally feels odd, especially since he just meets them. Often the book's humour works, but just as often it feels contrived. And I felt cheated at the end when some big secrets are revealed - things we've anticipated for half the book - and we don't get to see the characters' responses. 
 But I came to love Irving's people. I loved seeing them interact with each other, pick up experience, get older, reflect on their earlier selves. They'll teach you about the female reproductive system or how many bushels of apples it takes to create a vat of cider. They'll make you consider how something as simple as a Ferris Wheel might seem mysterious and magical, or how it might feel to ride a bicycle if you've never ridden one before. 
 I also liked the book's central allegory about blindly following rules. At times the theme felt a bit didactic, but at others times it felt beautifully integrated into the story. 
 The author has great empathy for his characters. And he knows how to create an entire fictional world. The details might not seem true in today's busy, cynical world, but they do in the world of the book. And that's enough for me. 
 I'm looking forward to entering another one of Irving's fictional worlds soon.

It's the early 1980s--the country is in a deep recession, and life after college is harder than ever. In the cafes on College Hill, the wised-up kids are inhaling Derrida and listening to Talking Heads. But Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English major, is writing her senior thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot, purveyors of the marriage plot that lies at the heart of the greatest English novels.
As Madeleine tries to understand why ""it became laughable to read writers like Cheever and Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about deflowering virgins in eighteenth-century France,"" real life, in the form of two very different guys, intervenes. Leonard Bankhead--charismatic loner, college Darwinist, and lost Portland boy--suddenly turns up in a semiotics seminar, and soon Madeleine finds herself in a highly charged erotic and intellectual relationship with him. At the same time, her old ""friend"" Mitchell Grammaticus--who's been reading Christian mysticism and generally acting strange--resurfaces, obsessed with the idea that Madeleine is destined to be his mate.
Over the next year, as the members of the triangle in this amazing, spellbinding novel graduate from college and enter the real world, events force them to reevaluate everything they learned in school. Leonard and Madeleine move to a biology Laboratory on Cape Cod, but can't escape the secret responsible for Leonard's seemingly inexhaustible energy and plunging moods. And Mitchell, traveling around the world to get Madeleine out of his mind, finds himself face-to-face with ultimate questions about the meaning of life, the existence of God, and the true nature of love.

 There are so many things I wish I could say coherently about this book. I was at a loss of words when I finished it three hours ago, and I still am speechless. But I want to write this review while the emotions it evoked are still at their strongest. 
 The writing was superb as always. Picoult doesn't use a lot of ""SAT"" vocabulary, or extremely complex sentence structure, but the way she engages readers with detail and finesse is extraordinary. I am always tempted to read just a single page more, then just one chapter more, until I've gone through the entire 400+ page book. I even forgot to put this on my to-read shelf on Goodreads. 
 Picoult's characters are splendid - by the middle of the book I was immersed in Zoe's yearning for children and Max's difficulty with alcohol abuse, and I felt like they were real, breathing people. Vanessa's no-nonsense attitude I admired, and side characters like Dara and Lucy I came to love as well. 
 The element that really made me appreciate this novel was Picoult's take on gay marriage, and homosexual inequality in contemporary society. I cannot adequately state how inspiring this book was to me in that regard. Here is one of the many powerful quotes that I had to stop and re-read (I even put this in my favorite quotes section on Facebook)... 
 ""I remember my mother telling me that, when she was a little girl in Catholic school, the nuns used to hit her left hand every time she wrote with it. Nowadays, if a teacher did that, she'd probably be arrested for child abuse. The optimist in me wants to believe sexuality will eventually become like handwriting: there's no right way or wrong way to do it. We're all just wired differently. 
 It's also worth nothing that, when you meet someone, you never bother to ask if he's right- or left- handed. 
 After all: Does it really matter to anyone other than the person holding the pen?""

Perched on a hill overlooking San Francisco, the house was magnificent, built in 1923 by a wealthy man for the woman he adored. For her and for this house, he would spare no expense and overlook no detail, from the endless marble floors to the glittering chandeliers. Almost a century later, with the once-grand house now in disrepair, a young woman walks through its empty rooms. Sarah Anderson, a perfectly sensible estate lawyer, is about to do something utterly out of character. An elderly client has died and left her two gifts. One is a generous inheritance. The other, a priceless message: to use his money for something wonderful, something daring. And in this old house, surrounded by crumbling grandeur, Sarah knows just what it is.
A respected attorney and self-described workaholic, Sarah had always lived life by the book. With a steady, if sputtering, relationship and a tiny apartment that has suited her just fine, Sarah cannot explain the force that draws her to the mansion and its history-to the story of a woman who once lived in the house, then mysteriously left it, to a child who grew up there, and a drama that unfolded in war-torn France...and to a history she never knew she had.
Taking the biggest risk of her life, Sarah enlists the help of architect Jeff Parker, who shares Sarah's passion for bringing the exquisite old house back to life. As she and Jeff work to restore the home's every detail, as one relationship shatters and another begins, Sarah makes a series of powerful discoveries: about the true meaning of a dying man's last gift...about the extraordinary legacies that are passed from generation to generation...and about a future she's only just beginning to imagine.<

 So I got on to Goodreads and added it to my to-read list. 
 Where it stayed for about two years. Every time I was deciding what to read next, I would come to this and be cooled by the 3.52 rating. It almost got to the point where I was going to take it off my list altogether. 
 What a mistake that would have been. I am shocked at the average rating of this book. I had only glazed over reviews, only because I wanted to avoid the chance of spoilers (generally negative reviews tend to be rife with them), but from what I can gather, some people have called this a knock off of Stephen King's IT or The Body. 
 Well, I guess if Pyper can be accused of anything, it would be a wonderful portrayal of four young friends in a creepy setting, and a revisit of the town's Bad Thing in their adult years.

1903,Cryptonomicon,Neal Stephenson,1999,2002,"Cryptonomicon zooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods--World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. ""When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty--we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.""
All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes--inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe--team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.",Children,Excellent,3,12,15,14.0,14,4.25,73962,4.0,"Pretenses are shabby things that, like papier-mache houses, must be energetically maintained or they will dissolve. 
 Neal Stephenson has written an overlong novel focusing on the significance of cryptography both in the world today and the time of World War II. He links the two by using multiple family generations. The predecessors inhabit the early cryptographical universe of Turing and others, dealing with cracking German and Japanese cyphers. The latter family representatives are trying to develop a secure cryptography that will support the creation of a global monetary system, based on gold stashed in the Philippines near the end of the war. 
 Neal Stephenson - from the LA Times 
 Stephenson provides considerable payload here, providing details of cryptography then and now, and considerable analysis of gold as the basis for economic structures. He also tells us much about how business is done when global actors are creating the information economies of the future. 
 There is no shortage of action here. But it is at the expense of character development. To the extent that the players have an inner life, it is radically overshadowed by the external events in which they are involved. The female characters are barely explored here, hardly more than window dressing to the experiences of the men, with considerable emphasis on their looks. This was unwelcome. 
 Still, I enjoyed the book. It is an engaging read, and worth the trip for the information it conveys.

1904,Song Of Susannah,Stephen King,2004,2006,"The next-to-last novel in Stephen King's seven-volume magnum opus, Song of Susannahis at once a book of revelation, a fascinating key to the unfolding mystery of the Dark Tower, and a fast-paced story of double-barreled suspense.
To give birth to her ""chap,"" demon-mother Mia has usurped the body of Susannah Dean and used the power of Black Thirteen to transport to New York City in the summer of 1999. The city is strange to Susannah...and terrifying to the ""daughter of none,"" who shares her body and mind.
Saving the Tower depends not only on rescuing Susannah but also on securing the vacant lot Calvin Tower owns before he loses it to the Sombra Corporation. Enlisting the aid of Manni senders, the remaining katet climbs to the Doorway Cave...and discovers that magic has its own mind. It falls to the boy, the billy-bumbler, and the fallen priest to find Susannah-Mia, who, in a struggle to cope witheach other and with an alien environment ""go todash"" to Castle Discordia on the border of End-World. In that forsaken place, Mia reveals her origins, her purpose, and her fierce desire to mother whatever creature the two of them have carried to term.
Eddie and Roland, meanwhile, tumble into western Maine in the summer of 1977, a world that should be idyllic but isn't. For one thing, it is real, and the bullets are flying. 
These are the simple vectors of a story rich in complexity and conflict. Its dual climaxes, one at the entrance to a deadly dining establishment and the other appended to the pages of a writer's journal, will leave readers gasping for the saga's final volume (which, Dear Reader, follows soon, say thank ya).",Fiction,Intermediate,10,1,14,8.0,9,3.98,87313,1.0,"I'm going to sit down and write reviews on the whole Dark Tower series after I finish, but I just have to say these books are becoming more and more tiresome. It just seems as if King has lost the vision of Roland the Gunslinger, so he - in order to have something to write about - constantly tinkers with the lore, changes history around, blames things on this multi-timestream concept, or spends whole novels describing an event merely to snap his fingers and change everything the next book so as to move his new plot line along. And the worst part of it all is that I've begun The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower and it appears to be in the same vein as the last two novels and not the great novels from earlier in the series. 
 To me, The Gunslinger, The Waste Lands and Wizard and Glass were epic works, because King seamlessly combined fantasy, post-apocalyptic, horror, and - dare I say it - western themes to create something fresh and grand. Reading one of those novels was like trying out a new dessert for the first time and savoring this delicious taste you had discovered. 
 On the other hand, The Drawing of the Three, Wolves of the Calla, and Song of Susannah read like contemporary, horror type novels, played out mainly in modern America rather than the addictive lands of Mid-World. It is just ho-hum fiction, nothing to set it apart from other books of that sort besides the title Dark Tower part whatever. 
 And if the gradual unraveling of a once great story wasn't progressing fast enough, Stephen King decides to do something that is just unthinkable to me: write himself into the story as a god-creator, almost a Rose Part Deux. 
 How could he have ever thought that was a good idea? 
 I honestly don't know, because it did nothing to actually make sense of the growing mess that is the Dark Tower series. Perhaps it will help shape the ending, but if so, I have just went todash and have witnessed the train wreck which will be the end of the Dark Tower series. 
 These are just my initial thoughts on Song of Susannah and the Dark Tower series as I begin reading the last book. No matter how annoyed I feel at this moment, I've made a commitment to finish the Dark Tower, so I will push forward, even though I cringe to think how bad the ending is going to be.",61.0,1,4239,12674.61,2.99,578,4,3,3

1906,The Tenth Circle,Jodi Picoult,2006,2006,"Jodi Picoult,the New York Timesbestselling author of Vanishing Acts,offers her most powerful chronicle yet of an American family with a story that probes the unbreakable bond between parent and child -- and the dangerous repercussions of trying to play the hero.
Trixie Stone is fourteen years old and in love for the first time. She's also the light of her father's life -- a straight-A student; a freshman in high school who is pretty and popular; a girl who's always looked up to Daniel Stone as a hero. Until, that is, her world is turned upside down with a single act of violence...and suddenly everything Trixie has believed about her family -- and herself -- seems to be a lie.
For fifteen years, Daniel Stone has been an even-tempered, mild-mannered man: a stay-at-home dad to Trixie and a husband who has put his own career as a comic book artist behind that of his wife, Laura, who teaches Dante's Infernoat a local college. But years ago, he was completely different: growing up as the only white boy in an Eskimo village, he was teased mercilessly for the color of his skin. He learned to fight back: stealing, drinking, robbing, and cheating his way out of the Alaskan bush. To become part of a family, he reinvented himself, channeling his rage onto the page and burying his past completely...until now. Could the young boy who once made Trixie's face fill with light when he came to the door have been the one to end her childhood forever? She says that he is, and that is all it takes to make Daniel, a man with a history he has hidden even from his family, venture to hell and back in order to protect his daughter.
The Tenth Circlelooks at that delicate moment when a child learns that her parents don't know all of the answers and when being a good parent means letting go of your child. It asks whether you can reinvent yourself in the course of a lifetime or if your mistakes are carried forever -- if life is, as in any good comic book, a struggle to control good and evil, or if good and evil control you.",Fiction,Novice,7,2,14,7.428571428571429,1,3.48,600,1.0,"We can't keep Jodi Picoult on the shelves in the bookstore where I work.

1907,The Once And Future King,Terence Hanbury White,1958,1987,"Alt cover image for ISBN 9780441627400
Once upon a time, a boy named 'Wart' was tutored by a magician named Merlin in preparation for a future he couldn't possibly imagine. A future in which he would ally himself with the greatest knights, love a legendary queen, and unite a country dedicated to chivalrous values. A future that would see him crowned and known for all time as Arthur, King of the Britons.",Nonfiction,Excellent,8,9,16,13.625,15,4.08,7,5.0,"Where I got the book: on bookshelf. Wasabi's, to be exact. 
 This is a sad, sad, sad, sad book. And also very funny. The first book is the funniest, and then they get sadder. It's like White took the Malory Morte d'Arthur and sucked all the silly stuff out of it so what's left is the essence of the Arthur legend in all its tragedy and glory. 
 And it was written at a horribly sad time. After two World Wars, things weren't looking too bright around Europe and that outlook colors EVERYTHING that was written at the time. In fact, this reminds me strongly of C.S. Lewis, of The Lord of the Rings, of every book in which writers tried to reconcile the horror of the recent past with the hope for the future. 
 Example: 
 ""The best thing for being sad,"" replied Merlyn...""is to learn something. That is the only thing that never fails. 
 ""You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honor trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then--to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting."" 
 Arthur begins as an eager boy, and ends as an ever-hopeful but misguided ruler who refuses to see the sin that's taking place under his nose. Lancelot is forever undermined by the path down which love has taken him. Galahad's virtue is so rarified that he has to be removed from this world. Merlyn - oh, I wish we'd had more of Merlyn - is living life backward and understanding it forward, possibly the worst tragedy that can happen to any man. 
 Tragedy and hope: ladies and gentlemen, I give you the 20th century. If you want to understand it, read this. Read The Lord of the Rings. Read C.S. Lewis. Read Ray Bradbury. From our age of small wars and nameless terrors, look back and try to understand how writers used a familiar past to understand a terrifying present, and did it with a sense of humor that we just don't have.

1910,The Underground Railroad,Colson Whitehead,2016,2016,"Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. Life is hellish for all the slaves but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood - where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned and, though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.
In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor - engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven - but the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. Even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.
As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroadis at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.",Fiction,Excellent,37,1,16,7.432432432432432,11,4.03,86839,4.0,"For the first time since before college and grad school, I actually have time to read the hyped, ""book of the year"" books.

--back cover",Fiction,Excellent,1,15,15,15.0,12,4.06,453,5.0,"Adam Johnson's The Orphan Master's Son defies categories and captives the reader's attention end to end. We are brought face to face with the brutal inhumanity of the Kim Jong Il dictatorship (which the author visited and tried to depict as accurately as possible given the lack of defectors and their testimony). But the even deeper story was how much suffering and deprivation humans can endure while remaining human. 
 For another interesting take on North Korea, I would highly recommend Guy Delisle's comic book Pyongyang. 
 -POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW- 
 I liked how in the first half we are with Pak Jun Do as he lives his life from the orphanage until his imprisonment because he participated in the mission to America and then we change to Commander Ga and it takes a while for us to see that we are still talking about the same person. I suppose that this is typical of life in that dictatorship where individualism is punished so the question of identity is likely a critical one for sanity in PDRK (sp?). I also loved the Sun Moon character and would have been heartbroken had she not left. Similarly, the Dark Rower, Wanda, Comrade Buc...the characters here did feel three-dimensional and fleshed out. The descriptions of torture were hard to bear but then no worse in the end than those described in A Brief History of Killings - just the difference of it being killing on the outside in James as opposed to killing on the inside in Johnson. Given the fascist/totalitarian tendencies of today's world, I would highly recommend this book to remind us why we - in western democracies at least - need to be conscious and proud of our freedoms of speech and movement and rights to individual expression and be committed to never let anyone impinge on them.",79.0,1,4320,4276.8,0.99,1097,4,1,4

When my best friend came to cheer me up, I played along. I promised her I'd take one last night to let loose and have fun before I embraced my future.
A sexy as sin bartender, and the hottest one-night-stand to ever exist, was not part of my plan.
Neither was the connection we had. We had nothing in common other than the same sense of humor and a spark neither could ignore. Yet fate kept shoving us together.

 Carina Adams, where have you been all my life? This story! These characters! The banter! The sex! I loved it all! I am seriously kicking myself, because this is the first book I have ever read by this author. Why book friends? Why were you guys holding out me?! I am so glad that I finally discovered her, and this awesome story! (No thanks to my ""friends."") 
 Lucien Chance a.k.a. Lucky, a local college football star, is at work when a beautiful blonde catches his eye. Sunny is looking to have one night of fun before she starts over with a new job and a new life. As the evening progresses, Lucky begins to look more and more like the good time she wants to have. Before long, she is agreeing to go back to his place where they spend the entire night having the most amazing sex of their lives. One night is all it was supposed to be, but when it's over, they can't stop thinking about each other. 
 Since Lucky neglected to get Sunny's phone number, he hopes to run into her at the bar where he works again so they can go for round two. Unfortunately for him, that never happens. Instead, he finds her in the most surprising place imaginable...his Org Behavior class. It turns out that Sunny is actually Emerson Bernard, his new professor. 
 Lucky is pretty sure banging his teacher will be frowned upon by the university, and Sunny concurs, so they agree to one last hurrah. As you can probably guess, that wasn't enough for them. Meeting in secret at each other's apartment becomes a regular occurrence. Lucky and Sunny can't keep their hands off of each other. Soon, it's obvious that their connection goes beyond just a physical attraction, but continuing on with their relationship could be detrimental to them both. He could have his scholarship revoked and be kicked off the team while Emerson could lose her job. There is no denying their growing feelings, but is that enough to risk it all? 
 Lucky was such a pleasant surprise! It completely exceeded my expectations. The writing is addictive and engaging. I never wanted to put the book down! The romance is sweet, forbidden, and HOT! Those sex scenes are no joke! All I can say is, I think the author has a lot of fun in her personal life. ;) That being said, I didn't just love the steamy scenes between Lucky and Sunny. I enjoyed all of the moments they spent together. In fact, the times when they opened up to one another, teased each other, went to visit his family, and just hung out were the times I felt their connection the most. 
 Lucky! That man had me swooning all over the place. He is pretty fantastic, and if Sunny didn't want him, I would gladly take him off her hands! Usually, the football player in romance novels is always a manwhore that only finally settles down when he meets the heroine. That is not the case here. Lucky is a one woman man. He is thoughtful, protective, generous, a monster in the bedroom, and an incredible athlete. What I loved most about him was his spectacularly filthy mouth. If dirty talkers are your thing, read this one asap! The cool thing is that in this story, it's not just the hero that has a dirty mouth. Sunny could make a biker blush with her colorful commentary, and I floved her for it! She is a sarcastic, sassy, smart, strong woman, in other words, everything I want in a heroine. 
 Why not five stars? I would have liked a little more about what happened to Lucky and his family. It was talked about a lot, but not enough details were given for my liking. Other than that, I adored everything about this book! 
 All in all, Lucky is a phenomenal forbidden romance that will make you smile, blush, fan yourself a time or two, and tear up when you least suspect it. I recommend this to fans of sports romance and forbidden romance. Hell, if you enjoy romantic books period, read it! This is a good one people! Don't say I never told you! Now, go add it to your tbr! Buy it! Read it! You won't be sorry!

Sebelumnya, upaya-upaya pembunuhan terhadap sang presiden selalu gagal. Informasi dan perencanaannya bocor ke tangan pemerintah lewat agen-agen yang disusupkan ke dalam organisasi rahasia tersebut.
Namun, kali ini serangan sang Jakal akan benar-benar rahasia dan mematikan!
Tidak ada satu pun arsip dan data yang dimiliki oleh pihak keamanan Prancis dan bahkan dinas rahasia di seluruh dunia terhadap pembunuh bayaran profesional top dunia ini.

Sebenarnya ini bukanlah hal yang aneh karena para pemimpin negara di berbagai belahan dunia ini seringkali menjadi target utama pembunuhan dari para lawan politiknya. 
 Presiden Soekarno sendiri selama masa pemerintahannya telah tujuh kali mengalami percobaan pembunuhan, begitu juga dengan pemimpin-pemimpin negara lainnya, rekor terbanyak hingga kini dipegang oleh pemimpin Cuba, Fidel Castro dengan 638 kali usaha percobaan pembunuhan terhadapnya. 
 Dari sekian banyak pemimpin dunia yang mendapat ancaman pembunuhan, Charles de Gaulle, (Presiden Perancis 1958-1969) adalah salah satu Presiden yang berkali-kali lolos dari upaya pembunuhan terhdap dirinya. Yang paling terkenal adalah yang terjadi pada tgl 22 Agustus 1962 dimana ia dan istrinya ditembak ketika sedang mengendarai mobil. Rencana pembunuhan ini dikomandoi oleh Kolonel Jean-Marie-Thiry, anggota militer Prancis sekaligus pemimpin OAS (Organisation L'armee Secrete), organisasi tentara rahasia yang berniat bertujuan menjatuhkan de Gaulle karena mereka berpendapat sang Presiden telah menghianati negaranya dengan memberi kemerdekaan kepada Aljazair yang semula merupakan tanah jajahan Prancis. 
 Rencana tersebut gagal, walau terdapat 14 lubang tembakan di mobilnya, Charles de Gaulle dan istrinya selamat dan Kolonel Thiry diganjar hukuman mati oleh pengadilan miltier Prancis pada tahun 1963. Persitiwa inilah yang kemudian mengilhami novelis Inggris Frederick Forsyth untuk menulis novel The Day of The Jackal (1971) 
 Dalam novelnya ini Forsyth mengawali kisahnya saat menjelang dilaksanakannya hukuman mati bagi Kolonel Jean-Marie-Thiry. Kemudian kisah bergerak mundur sejenak ke peristiwa percobaan pembunuhan de Gaulle yang dikomandoi oleh Kolonel Thiry. Paska percobaan pembunuhan yang gagal inilah yang oleh Forsyth dijadikan pijakan awal dalam mengembangkan imajinasinya. 
 Kematian Kolonel Thiry selaku pimpinan OAS tak membuat putus asa anggota-anggotanya. Belajar dari kegagalan-kegagalan sebelumnya, Kolonel Rodin, salah satu petinggi OAS membuat sebuah rencana rahasia untuk mencoba kembali membunuh Presiden de Gaulle melalui jasa seorang pembunuh profesional. Untuk mencegah bocornya rencana ini maka hanya tiga petinggi OAS dan sang pembunuh bayaran yang mengetahuinya. 
 Seluruh rencana pembunuhan diserahkan pada si pembunuh bayaran dari Inggris dengan nama sandi ""Jackal"". OAS hanya menyediakan bayaran yang diminta oleh si jackal yaitu 500 ribu dolar ( Rp. 4,5 Milyar), jumlah yang fantastis di tahun 60an. Setelah menerima uang muka dari OAS, mulailah sang Jackal melakukan berbagai persiapan mulai dari memesan senjata khusus dengan peluru berhulu ledak yang jika mengenai kepala akan menghancurkan segalanya di dalam tulang tengkorak, membuat 4 buah paspor palsu, hingga mempersiapkan perlengkapan penyamaran secara matang. 
 Berkat kejelian kepolisian Prancis, rencana pembunuhan terhadap Presiden de Gaulle kembali tercium, hanya saja kali ini mereka dibuat hampir mati kutu karena yang mereka ketahui hanyalah ciri-ciri fisik si pembunuh yaitu pria Inggris jangkung dengan rambut pirang, selain itu tak ada satu arsip dan data yang dimiliki pihak keamanan Prancis mengenai nama pembunuh, kapan, dimana, dan bagaimana si pembunuh professional ini akan beraksi. 
 Dengan nyawa Presiden sebagai taruhannya, pihak kepolisian Prancis yang dipimpin oleh Claude Lebel, detektif terbaik Prancis dan dibantu oleh kepolisian dari lima negara Eropa plus Amerika dan Afrika bertarung dengan waktu dan kecerdasan si Jackal dalam melaksanakannya tugas yang diembannya. 
 Kaya akan detail 
 Yang membuat novel ini menarik adalah bagaimana Forsyth menghadirkan detail-detail fakta dan peristiwanya. Hal ini bisa jadi keunggulan sekaligus kelemahan dimata pembacanya. Bagi yang menyukai kisah dengan plot cepat hal ini bisa jadi membosankan, terlebih jika pembaca tidak begitu menguasai materi yang dipaparkan si penulis. 
 Contohnya adalah soal senjata rakitan yang dipakai oleh si Jackal. Di sini penulis memaparkan secara detail mulai dari ukuran, jenis logam, alat picu, dsb yang tentunya membuat pembaca yang awam akan senjata jadi bosan, namun bagi mereka yang akrab dengan senjata mungkin hal ini merupakan bagian yang menarik. 
 Selain soal senjata, detail-detail soal pencurian paspor, pembuatan SIM Internasional dan paspor palsu, penyamaran si jackal, bagaimana ia mengelabui petugas keamanan dan imigrasi , cara kerja seorang detektif dalam merangkai data, dan sebagainya juga dibeberkan dalam novel ini. Selain itu penulis juga memaparkan latar belakang politik Prancis di masa pemerintahan Charles de Gaulle yang tentunya akan menambah wawasan pembacanya dalam hal situasi politik Prancis di tahun 60-an. 
 Kesemua itu diramu oleh Forsyth menjadi sebuah kisah triller yang menarik, walau di awal-awal agak terasa membosankan karena detail-detail diatas namun di bag-bab terakhir pembaca akan dibawa pada puncak ketegangan ketika Sang Presiden telah berada dalam bidikan senjata sang Jackal. 
 Di novel ini juga dikisahkan bagaimana Union Corse sebuah sindikat kejahatan yang terorganisir di Prancis yang lebih tua dan berbahaya daripada Mafia Sisilia turut membantu kepolisian Prancis untuk memburu sang Jackal. Sayangnya Forsyth kurang mengeksplorasi keterlibatan Union Corse, kalau saja peran organisasi rahasia ini diberi porsi yang lebih besar novel ini pasti akan lebih menarik lagi. 
 Novel yang berbahaya 
 Saking detailnya penulis memberikan gambaran bagaima sang Jackal mempersiapkan dirinya untuk melaksanakan perkerjaan profersionalnya, buku ini ternyata memberikan dampak yang mungkin tidak terduga oleh Forsyth sebelumnya. 
 Metode untuk mendapatkan paspor palsu yang secara diteil dijelaskan dalam buku ini berhasil ditiru oleh banyak orang. Metode yang akhirnya dikenal dengan istilah ""Day of the Jackal Fraud"" ini kemudian dianggap sebagai celah keamanan paling rentan di Inggris sehingga pemerintah Inggris akhirnya melakukan perubahan besar-besaran dalam birokrasi pengurusan dokumen. 
 Usaha sang Jackal untuk membunuh presiden Prancis juga mengilhami Yigal Amir, seorang militan ekstrem kanan untuk membunuh PM Israel Yithzak Rabin pada 1955. Vladimir Arutnunian yang pada tahun 2005 berencana membunuh Presiden AS George W. Bush mengaku terobsesi untuk melakukan apa yang dilakukan oleh Jackal. 
 Dari fakta-fakta diatas rasanya tak berlebihan kalau novel ini saya anggap sebagai novel yang memikat sekaligus berbahaya! 
 Sejarah Penerbitan dan Adaptasi film 
 The Day of The Jackal karya Frederick Forsyth ini pertama kali diterbitkan di Inggris pada 1971 oleh penerbit Huthcinson dan langsung menjadi best seller. Di tahun 1972 novel ini meraih penghargaan novel terbaik Edgar Allan Poe.

Among them is Major Ernest Pettigrew (retired), the unlikely hero of Helen Simonson's wondrous debut. Wry, courtly, opinionated, and completely endearing, Major Pettigrew is one of the most indelible characters in contemporary fiction, and from the very first page of this remarkable novel he will steal your heart.
The Major leads a quiet life valuing the proper things that Englishmen have lived by for generations: honor, duty, decorum, and a properly brewed cup of tea.

Drawn together by their shared love of literature and the loss of their respective spouses, the Major and Mrs. Ali soon find their friendship blossoming into something more.

1923,Firefly Lane,Kristin Hannah,2008,2008,"In the summer of 1974, Kate Mularkey has accepted her place at the bottom of the eighth-grade social food chain. Then, to her amazement, the ""coolest girl in the world"" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all--beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn; Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become TullyandKate. Inseparable.
So begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Laneis the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the mainstay of their lives.
From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success...and loneliness.
All Kate really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her...how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend....
For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship--jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart...and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.
Firefly Laneis for anyone who ever drank Boone's Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it's the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It's about promises and secrets and betrayals.

Meet Martin, JJ, Jess, and Maureen. Four people who come together on New Year's Eve: a former TV talk show host, a musician, a teenage girl, and a mother. Three are British, one is American. They encounter one another on the roof of Topper's House, a London destination famous as the last stop for those ready to end their lives.
In four distinct and riveting first-person voices, Nick Hornby tells a story of four individuals confronting the limits of choice, circumstance, and their own mortality. This is a tale of connections made and missed, punishing regrets, and the grace of second chances.
Intense, hilarious, provocative, and moving, A Long Way Downis a novel about suicide that is, surprisingly, full of life.
What's your jumping-off point?
Maureen
Why is it the biggest sin of all? All your life you're told that you'll be going to this marvelous place when you pass on. And the one thing you can do to get you there a bit quicker is something that stops you getting there at all. Oh, I can see that it's a kind of queue-jumping. But if someone jumps the queue at the post office, people tut. Or sometimes they say ""Excuse me, I was here first."" They don't say ""You will be consumed by hellfire for all eternity."" That would be a bit strong.
Martin
I'd spent the previous couple of months looking up suicides on the Internet, just out of curiosity. And nearly every single time, the coroner says the same thing: ""He took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed."" And then you read the story about the poor bastard: His wife was sleeping with his best friend, he'd lost his job, his daughter had been killed in a road accident some months before . . . Hello, Mr. Coroner? I'm sorry, but there's no disturbed mental balance here, my friend. I'd say he got it just right.
Jess
I was at a party downstairs. It was a shit party, full of all these ancient crusties sitting on the floor drinking cider and smoking huge spliffs and listening to weirdo space-out reggae. At midnight, one of them clapped sarcastically, and a couple of others laughed, and that was it-Happy New Year to you, too. You could have turned up to that party as the happiest person in London, and you'd still have wanted to jump off the roof by five past twelve. And I wasn't the happiest person in London anyway. Obviously.

New Year's Eve was a night for sentimental losers. It was my own stupid fault. Of course there'd be a low-rent crowd up there. I should have picked a classier date-like March 28, when Virginia Woolf took her walk into the river, or November 25 (Nick Drake).

1926,Sophie'S Choice,William Styron,1979,1998,"Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time
""[One morning] in the early spring, I woke up with the remembrance of a girl I'd once known, Sophie. It was a very vivid half-dream, half-revelation, and all of a sudden I realized that hers was a story I had to tell."" That very day, William Styron began writing the first chapter of Sophie's Choice.
First published in 1979, this complex and ambitious novel opens with Stingo, a young southerner, journeying north in 1947 to become a writer. It leads us into his intellectual and emotional entanglement with his neighbors in a Brooklyn rooming house: Nathan, a tortured, brilliant Jew, and his lover, Sophie, a beautiful Polish woman whose wrist bears the grim tattoo of a concentration camp...and whose past is strewn with death that she alone survived.
""Sophie's Choice is a passionate, courageous book...a philosophical novel on the most important subject of the twentieth century,"" said novelist and critic John Gardner in The New York Times Book Review. ""One of the reasons Styron succeeds so well in Sophie's Choice is that, like Shakespeare (I think the comparison is not too grand), Styron knows how to cut away from the darkness of his material, so that when he turns to it again it strikes with increasing force....Sophie's Choice is a thriller of the highest order, all the more thrilling for the fact that the dark, gloomy secrets we are unearthing one by one--sorting through lies and terrible misunderstandings like a hand groping for a golden nugget in a rattlesnake's nest--may be authentic secrets of history and our own human nature.""
The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its
emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-
gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.",Nonfiction,Excellent,47,1,15,6.1063829787234045,3,4.18,103,5.0,"Sophie's Choice: William Styron's Novel of Choices, Hobson's and Otherwise 
 This novel was chosen by members of On the Southern Literary Trail as a group read for September, 2014. 
 Sophie's Choice, First Ed., First Prtg., William Styron, Random House, New York, New York, 1979 
 The gate to Auschwitz, where those in charge choose who lives and who dies 
 Life is but a series of choices, is it not? Some easy, quickly made, given no further thought. Others are more difficult. We worry about the outcome, the consequences. After much thought, we arrive at a choice, live with it, find we worried over nothing, or become haunted by consequences we never envisioned. Call it free will. 
 When we are very young life is much simpler, is it not? Our decisions are made for us. By our parents, our caretakers. Perhaps caregivers sounds better. We do not know about the idea of free will, so we do not worry about it. We just take what comes. We are grateful if we have kind parents and caregivers. No, that's not right, we are simply happy because that is what we learn to expect. Many children learn to expect nothing good to happen. Neither the happy children or the sad children have a choice in the matter. It is simply the way it is. 
 A child who expected nothing good to happen, from the film ""Schindler's List 
 But Sophie's Choice by William Styron deals with choices made principally by his title character in a setting where the choices are given under duress, which are choices not freely made, or choices which have no satisfactory outcome, the classic Hobson's choice. Sophie is an Aryan, not Jewish. However, she is Polish. The Nazi regime despises the Poles as they did the mentally ill, physically imperfect, the gypsies, homosexuals, and dissident intellectuals. All will go to the camps. And all will only leave up through the chimneys of the crematoria. 
 Styron's method of telling Sophie's story is a master stroke of plotting. Rather than resort to the omniscient ""god"" like narrator, Styron inserts himself into the story as his younger self. ""Call me Stingo."" Echoing the words of Herman Melville,""Call me Ishmael,"" Styron relates key facts of his life as a young manuscript reader at McGraw-Hill Publishing who aspires to become a writer. Following his brief stay there, he is terminated. He must move to more affordable lodging. 
 His search lands him in a boarding house in 1947 Brooklyn, a time when trees still grew there. The older Styron writes of himself as a younger more callow figure. Stingo tells us, 
 ""To make matters worse, I was out of a job and had very little money and was self-exiled to Flatbush--like others of my countrymen, another lean and lonesome Southerner wandering amid the Kingdom of the Jews."" 
 Oh, yes. Stingo is a Southerner. A Virginian, born and bred, with a degree from Duke University. Not only is he close to impoverished and lonesome, he is lonesome for female company. Among his scant belongings is an unopened box of condoms upon which he casts a wistful look from time to time. 
 Stingo's feverish libido is fired by the nightly sounds of unbridled and enthusiastic celebrations of the ars amatoria from the room above his. It is difficult to sleep, to even think. To write is impossible. Bed springs squeak and a head board beats against a wall with a steadily increasing rhythm. There are brief interludes of silence and then the sounds of the circle of life slowly begin again rising to crescendoing heights. It drives Stingo to distraction. 
 Then we meet the unabashed coupling couple. One Nathan Landau and Miss Sophie Zawistowska. Nathan is Jewish. Sophie is not. She is a Polish Catholic who survived internment at Auschwitz. 
 Stingo walks into the boarding house to find the couple arguing. Not all is well with the two lovers upstairs. 
 At the house Sophie and Nathan were embroiled in combat just outside the door of my room... 
 ""Don't give me any of that, you hear,"" I hear him yell. ""You're a liar! You're a miserable lying cunt, do you hear me? A cunt!...[T]hat's what you are, you moron--a two-timing, double-crossing cunt! Spreading that twat of yours for a cheap, chiseling quack doctor. Oh, God!"" he howled, and his voice rose in wild uncontained rage. ""Let me out of here before I murder you--you whore! 
 Then Nathan turned his attention on Stingo. 
 ""You're from the South,"" he said.. ""Morris told me you were from the South. Said your name's Stingo. Yetta needs a Southerner in her house to fit in with all the other funnies...Too bad I won't be around for a lively conversation, but I'm getting out of here. It would have been nice to talk with you...We'd have had great fun, shootin' the shit, you and I. We could have talked about sports. I mean Southern sports. Like lynching niggers--or coons, I think you call them down there...Too bad. Old Nathan's got to hit the road. Maybe in another life, Cracker, we'll get together. So long, Cracker! See you in another life."" 
 Odd, how those who are the targets of prejudice are among the most intolerant, is it not so? 
 Stingo immediately goes to comfort Sophie. However, his feelings are conflicted. Although his choice is to comfort her, his wish is to possess her. He is captured by her beauty. And Styron will make it clear through the novel that men are frequently drawn to Sophie by her beauty. 
 One important thing that the reader must realize is that Styron is dealing with two time frames. He is dealing with the present in which he is writing the book. He is dealing with the present of 1947 in which the action actually occurs. It is through this distancing that Styron is able to set up throughout the novel moments of foreshadowing. It must never be forgotten that Old Stingo/Styron knows how this tale ends. It is a flashback within a flashback. 
 Styron gradually reveals to us that Nathan Landau is brilliant, wealthy, but mentally ill. He is capable of great charm, care, and generosity. Nathan has chosen upon meeting Sophie who is still suffering from the after effects of her internment in Auschwitz to bring her back to health and save her life. He takes her to his brother Larry who is a physician who treats her and refers her to other physicians. Upon their meeting Sophie suffers from scurvy, has endured typhus, scarlet fever, and malnutrition. She has lost her teeth. 
 Nathan has provided perfect dentures for her. Clothing. Most important to Sophie, music in the form of the latest model phonograph and records, extremely expensive in that day. And Nathan restored her eroticism to her the sense of which was totally lost to her in Auschwitz. 
 Nathan will also make the positive choice to befriend Stingo. Stingo will become part of a threesome, included in Nathan's and Sophie's adventures. Nathan will come to praise Stingo's writing giving him the confidence to complete what will become his first novel, Styron's Lie Down in Darkness. The novels most charming moments are when the three are together on one of Nathan's elaborately planned adventures. It has the sense of Truffaut's ""Jules et Jim."" 
 Old Stingo will recall, 
 ""There are friends one makes at a youthful age in whom one simply rejoices, for whom one possesses a love and loyalty mysteriously lacking in the friendships made in after-years, no matter how genuine."" 
 Oddly enough, Nathan's misgivings about Stingo were not totally inaccurate. Stingo has his share of Southern guilt with which to live. It seems that his family once had a slave named Artiste and he was put out to work. The value of that work was a large sum of money which came into his father's possession. His father sent Stingo his share of that burden of Southern history. It was that largesse that allowed him to continue to live in Brooklyn and write. The reveal of this information instantly brought a comparison of Stingo to Quentin Compson. ""I don't hate it,"" Quentin said, quickly, at once, immediately; ""I don't hate it,"" he said. ""I don't hate it he thought, panting in the cold air, the iron New England dark: I don't. I don't! I don't hate it! I don't hate it!"" Absalom, Absalom!, by William Faulkner. 
 Nathan chooses to self medicate with amphetamines and cocaine. An employee at Pfizer Laboratories, he easily obtains what he needs. The ""Bennies"" the cocaine make him fly. It is when he begins to crash that his Mr. Hyde personality appears. Sophie can only hope that barbiturates can ease him into sleep before he emotionally abuses her or physically harms her. 
 It is during those periods of time that Nathan abandons Sophie that Stingo becomes her confidant. Though she has lost her faith in the horror of Auschwitz, she treats Stingo as the priest in the confessional. Stingo is a safe confidant. John Steinbeck reminded us in East of Eden, ""Perhaps the best conversationalist in the world is the man who helps others to talk."" Stingo helped Sophie to talk. It is in Sophie's narration to Stingo that we are gradually led to Sophie's Choice. Old Stingo/Styron repeatedly reveals bits and pieces that lead us to believe that it was horrible indeed. It was. 
 In a novel as dark as this a reader is grateful for any brief respite of humor. Styron provides it here in young Stingo's pursuit of sexual satisfaction. There is the divine Leslie Lapidus who loves to talk dirty, and can talk the talk with expertise but cannot bring herself to do the deed. She envisions Stingo with his Southern accent as some Cavalier officer of the Confederate army. 
 ""I mean, I don't know much about the Civil War, but whenever I think of that time--I mean, ever since Gone With the Wind I've had these fantasies about those generals, those gorgeous young Southern generals with their tawny mustaches and beards, and hair in ringlets, on horseback. And those beautiful girls in crinoline and pantalettes. You would never know that they ever fucked, from all you're able to read."" She paused and squeezed my hand. ""I mean, doesn't it just do something to you to think of one of those ravishing girls with that crinoline all in a fabulous tangle, and one of those gorgeous young officers--I mean, both of them fucking like crazy?"" 
 ""Oh yes,"" I said with a shiver, ""oh yes, it does. It enlarges one's sense of history."" 
 Then there's Sally Ann, the Baptist, she of the stalwart hand. She leaves Stingo wrung out like a limp wash rag. Stingo complains he could have done that better himself. 
 But we must return to Nathan, Sophie, Stingo, and Auschwitz. 
 The last time Nathan broke with reality, he threatened to murder Sophie and Stingo. He believed they had made love. He was wrong about that. 
 Stingo was determined to save Sophie from Nathan. He persuaded her to go with him to a farm owned by his father in Virginia. It was on that trip Sophie revealed her choice at Auschwitz. It was on that trip that Sophie made love to Stingo. And she asked if there was a Berlitz language school near there so she might learn to write in English. 
 ""There are so many things that people still don't know about that place!"" she said fiercely. ""There are so many things I haven't even told you Stingo, and I've told you so much. You know, about how the whole place was covered with the smell of burning Jews, day and night. I've told you that. But I never even told you hardly anythng about Birkenau, when they begun to starve me to death and I go so sick I almost died...Or..."" And here she paused, gazed into space, then said, ""There are so many terrible things I could tell. But maybe I could write it as a novel, you see, if I learned to write English good, and then I could make people understood how the Nazis made you do things you never believed you could...I was so afraid! They made me afraid of everything! Why don't I tell the truth about myself? Why don't I write it down in a book that I was a terrible coward, that I was a filthy collaboratrice that I done everything that was bad just to save myself?"" She made a savage moan, so loud above the racket of the train that heads turned nearby and eyes rolled. ""Oh, Stingo, I can't stand living with these things!"" 
 Viktor E. Frankl wrote in Man's Search for Meaning ""Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'."" Perhaps Sophie lost her why at Auschwitz. 
 Birkenau: Those who do not have a why to live cannot bear any how. Is it not so? 
 Now we come to one Thomas Hobson who was an English Stable Keeper around 1600. He always required his customers to take the horse nearest the door or none at all. It came to be known as Hobson's choice, meaning what appears to be a free choice which offers no option at all. That was Sophie's choice. Was it not so? 
 Let us allow young Stingo to have the last word, shall we? 
 ""Someday I will understand Auschwitz. This was a brave statement but innocently absurd. No one will ever understand Auschwitz. What I might have set down with more accuracy would have been: Someday I will write about Sophie's life..., and thereby help demonstrate how absolute evil is never extinguished from the world. Auschwitz itself remains inexplicable. The most profound statement yet made about Auschwitz was not a statement at all, but a response. 
 The query: ""At Auschwitz, tell me, where was God?"" 
 And the answer: ""Where was man?"" 
 I have mentioned the work of Viktor Frankl. This novel stands on equal footing with Night by Elie Wiesel, The Last of the Just by Andre Schwarz-Bart, and Schindler's List byThomas Keneally. 
 William Styron won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1980. He was a finalist for the National Critics Circle Award. However, reviews were mixed. Styron was criticized for having taken on a topic to huge to be taken on in any manner other than silence, ignoring earlier works in existence and widely recognized. A narrower criticism was based on Styron having selected a Polish Catholic as his central character as the Holocaust's purpose was deemed the extermination of the Jewish Race. Styron responded in an essay in the New York Times that the Holocaust transcended anti-Semitism, that ""its ultimate depravity lay in the fact that it was anti-human,"" he wrote. ""Anti-life."" 
 All who suffered under the Third Reich suffered universally. Was it not so?

 The Lebensborn Program Lebensborn"" translates to ""wellspring of life"" or ""fountain or life."" The Lebensborn project was one of most secret and terrifying Nazi projects. Heinrich Himmler founded the Lebensborn project on December 12, 1935, the same year the Nuremberg Laws outlawed intermarriage with Jews and others who were deemed inferior. For decades, Germany's birthrate was decreasing. Himmler's goal was to reverse the decline and increase the Germanic/Nordic population of Germany to 120 million. Himmler encouraged SS and Wermacht officers to have children with Aryan women. He believed Lebensborn children would grow up to lead a Nazi-Aryan nation. 
 The program ran from 1939-1945. Polish children were particular targets of the program with allegedly over 100,000 children stolen from their parents. 
 In an effort to save her son, Jan, Sophie begged Auschwitz Commander Rudolp Hoess to enter him into the Lebensborn Program. She doubted that he ever did anything. Hoess is the only real character to appear in the pages of Sophie's Choice. He did serve as the commandant at Auscwitz. He was a defendant at the Nuremberg Trials and sentenced to death. The author gratefully acknowledges the Jewish Virtual Library for information regarding Lebensborn and Rudoplh Hoess. This library may be located at http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/.

1927,Cell,Stephen King,2006,2006,"There is a reason cell rhymes with hell.
On October 1, God is in His heaven, the stock market stands at 10,140, most of the planes are on time, and Clayton Riddell, an artist from Maine, is almost bouncing up Boylston Street in Boston. He's just landed a comic book deal that might finally enable him to support his family by making art instead of teaching it. He's already picked up a small (but expensive!) gift for his long-suffering wife, and he knows just what he will get for his boy Johnny. Why not a little treat for himself? Clay is feeling good about the future.
That changes in a hurry. The cause of the devastation is a phenomenon that will come to be known as The Pulse, and the delivery method is a cell phone. Everyone's cell phone. Clay and the few desperate survivors who join him suddenly find themselves in the pitch-black night of civilization's darkest age, surrounded by chaos, carnage, and a human horde that has been reduced to its basest nature...and then begins to evolve.
There is really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clay, an arrow points home to Maine, and as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north they begin to see crude signs confirming their direction. A promise, perhaps. Or a threat...
There are 193 million cell phones in the United States alone. Who doesn't have one? Stephen King's utterly gripping, gory, and fascinating novel doesn't just ask the question,Can you hear me now? It answers it with a vengeance.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,1,13,4.7,13,3.64,2582,4.0,"For some reason, I had seen quite a few bad reviews on Cell before I read it. Not one to usually dislike a King novel, I did go into this one without the highest of expectations and ended up being very pleasantly surprised. 
 The story centers around a mass event that turns anyone who happens to be on their cell phone at the time into a zombie. Mass chaos ensues and a small group of survivors bands together and tries to figure out what is going on and how to stop it. Some of the plot-line does have some similarity to The Stand, but the characters are fairly unique, the dialog is good, and the action keeps rolling along at a fairly brisk pace. 
 I really liked this novel. I knew that I probably would, but it was a nice surprise that it was as good as it was. I am of the opinion that not everything that Stephen King writes is destined to be a classic, but the majority of his work is well above average and I feel that one day he will be given his long overdue kudos and be placed in the literary canon with the other greats of modern literature.",32.0,1,1307,5933.78,4.54,80,2,4,2

She's sixty-five years old, and if her neighbors are away, why shouldn't she skinny-dip in their swimming pools? But when she discovers that the money she relies on is dwindling and that her beloved home is at stake, Nan knows she must make drastic changes. She decides to offer rooms for rent, and slowly people start to fill the house with noise, laughter and tears.
There's Daniel, the quiet, contemplative father of two girls; Daff, the single mother of a truculent teenager; and Nan's own son, who's come home for the summer. As the house comes alive again, Nan finds her family expanding - until an unexpected visitor turns all their lives upside down.

This cloud is self-sustaining and self-reproducing. It is intelligent and learns from experience. For all practical purposes, it is alive.
It has been programmed as a predator. It is evolving swiftly, becoming more deadly with each passing hour.
Every attempt to destroy it has failed.
And we are the prey.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,5,15,5.9375,14,3.72,133370,4.0,"This is my first Michael Crichton read, and I loved it. Prey is told in first person by Jack Foreman, a stay-at-home dad, who suspects his wife, Julia, of having an affair. Julia, a vice president at Xymos, a molecular manufacturing company, works late night, and one night she doesn't even come home at all. Eventually, Julia shows Jack a video demonstration of what they're working on - a cloud of nanoparticles, which works as one big camera. Then something goes wrong at the facility and Jack is invited by Ricky, his former employee to come and help fix the problem. A cloud of nanoparticles -- micro-robots -- has escaped from the laboratory, and he has to get it back. But this cloud is self-reproducing, intelligent; it evolves quickly, and is now a threat. There at the facility Jack learns the truth about his wife, the nanoparticles, and his former co-workers. 
 The book has a slow start. Jacks suspects his wife of having an affair and he's taking time on deciding what to do because he isn't very sure yet. He doesn't want a divorce; he wants to keep his family together, and his kids, always biting each other, are not helping matters. He can't get a job; he's rejected wherever he applies because of a 'got fired for doing the right thing' incident in his former workplace. 
 And then the story kicks off when he's asked to come and solve a problem at the plant. Then comes the action, the suspense, and of course the thrill. You wouldn't want to be anywhere near the swarms - those molecular robots. They're dangerous, they hurt the skin, and they can get into your nasal cavity, suffocating you. They kill wildlife as well as humans. Jack has to stop it, no matter what. Because he designed the program used in modeling the swarms. But he can't do it himself. There are other notable characters there like the quiet, strong and beautiful Mae; devious Ricky; loud-farting/non-stop talking Charley; and of course Jack's beautiful and secretive wife, Julia. Some of these characters help to achieve the goal, while others stand in Jack's way. There are lots of deaths in the end. 
 I loved the technological and biological details the author wove in the various part of the story. It's blended well into the narrative and doesn't cause any distraction. Even though I found some of them boring or overly done, I still learnt something from them. 
 The five-paged bibliography at the end of the book shows well the thorough research undertaken by the author for this book. It is a book worth reading, and I'll certainly read more titles from Crichton. I have my mind on Jurassic Park next. Although I've seen the movie, I'd still love to experience the book side of it. 
 I recommend this book to any sci-fi and techno-thriller lover. If you like the science-goes-wrong genre, then this is the book for you.

 Collection of postmodern short stories from the 1960s and 1970s penned by that master of the genre, American author Donald Barthelme. Some short non-fiction satire is also included. Of course, I enjoyed a number of pieces more than others but one short zapper really hit home for me, most likely since I have been interested in art and aesthetics for a number of years. Reading Letters To The Editor I imagine myself sitting in a whaling boat watching lampoon-harpooner Daggoo-Barthelme hurling lampoon-harpoons at the whales of the art world. Ready, aim, let her soar, Daggoo-Donald! Here is a list of needle-sharp zingers from the hand on our intrepid harpooning author: 
 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
 The Controversy: Nicolai Pont, editor of Shock Art magazine admits a raw, tender nerve has been hit when his international art journal published an article on an exhibit by American artist Doug LeDuff featuring an original series of asterisks. Editor Pont announces Stock Art will accept only one more letter on the controversy before the subject is closed forever. Shock Art - love that name for the magazine and the mind-set of the people who run it, being shocked when an article they print about art actually shocks. 
 Art Theft: Bernardo Brown of Galerie Z accuses LaDuff of shamelessly copying the asterisks of Gianbello Bruno, a fellow Italian, an artist his Galerie Z represents. Bernardo points to a 1978 Paris exposition where artist Bruno incorporated a series of asterisks into his work. Sure, the American claims he has been painting asterisks since 1975 but, Bernando Brown asks: Where are these asterisks? Where is the proof? One of my favorite Barthelme lampoons here is the name of the American Artist Doug LeDuff. Doug is a common enough American name, but what about that LeDuff? Sounds like the artist or his agent committed some genuine art theft to conquer the European art market, combining the names of two famous, influential French artists - Le Corbusier and Jean Dubuffet. 
 Gallery Opening - Where art and party time come together 
 A Proud Heritage: Galerie Z is in Milan and Bernardo plays his trump card, since, after all, he is from the land that graced us with the Italian Renaissance and all those great Italian masters, the greatest artists the world has ever seen. ""Of course the fully American attitude of the partisans of LeDuff, that there is nothing except America, is evident here in the apparently fair evaluation of the protagonists which is in fact deeply biased in the direction of their native land."" Bernardo curtly dismisses the evidence LeDuff painted six pointed asterisks as opposed to the five pointed ones of Bruno; he also dismisses the fact that LeDuff predated Bruno in superimposing one asterisk on another. Bruno's tacit accusation: Americans are untalented, moneygrubbing bunglers, coarse hicks incapable of the barest shred of artistic originality, forever crudely copying and mimicking refined, highly accomplished European artists. (Of course, Bruno might be correct on this point, at least generally, but there is always that rare exception!) 
 Rome Chimes In: Pino Vitt smiles at the entire LeDufff-Galerie Z controversy asking: What do these bloody Americans really want after they come to Europe, are installed in the most sumptuous hotels yet still find reasons to complain about everything? Those childish, no talent Yanks made rich by our stupid bourgeois fly back home to figure out more ways to dupe and despoil our gullible bourgeois. ""Doug LeDuff is a pig and a child, but so are his enemies."" What is so great about this letter is Pino adds nothing to the subject at hand but rather takes the opportunity to slam the whole art scene - artist, supporters, detractors; if you are out there as part of the art scene, you're fodder for Pino's slam. Maybe Pino Vitt is still smarting from the humiliating loss Rome suffered at the hands of Milan in the latest soccer match. Or, perhaps, he envisions himself as a great Roman general put in the position of being required to put down the barbarians on Rome's borders. Or, perhaps Pino is an unrecognized artist producing paintings or sculptures or installations unacceptable to the art world. 
 Dusseldorf Chimes In: Hugo Timme points out to the faculty of the LeDuff-Galerie Z debate that LeDuff's art is so much bad wallpaper but Shock Art Magazine was irresponsible accepting for publication a Galerie Z ad defaming LeDuff. Hugo goes on to enlighten all by proclaiming that LeDuff and Bruno have both impersonated the accomplishments of the 1938 Magdeburg Handwerker. Ah, a German historian to the rescue. And love his referring to those contributors to the debate as ""faculty"" then skewering their ideas. 
 Artists Chime In: The members of an artist's group in Basel, Switzerland let it be known they are unfaltering supporters of the immense American master, Doug LeDuff. This is an international crowd with first names of Gianni, Michel, Zin and Erik. And it isn't an accident they are in Basel, the cradle of modern avant-garde art going back to the early years of the twentieth century. And, of course, having their names listed one under another, manifesto-like, adds weight to their support. 
 Photo of a group of artists - could be 1966 or 2016. Some things never change. 
 Rotteerdam Chimes In: Madga Baum is outraged that the galleries, critics and collectors bickering in this LeBuff debate have ignored the artist Elaine Grasso, who has been working in the field of parentheses. Oh, those damn men and the male dominated art world overlooking a real artist just because she's a woman! 
 Athens Chimes in: G. Philios lets everyone know their debate is complexly misguided since the asterisk is from the Greek asteriskos (or small star) and has served a very specific function going all the way back to Greek mythology. G. Philios ends by making a specific plea to the editors to publish his letter so people will know he set the record straight. 
 An Art Critic Chimes In: Yes, Shock Art Magazine consulted Titus Toselli Dolla in Palermo, a highly respected art critic, to contribute a letter on the subject. As part of his letter, Titus denounces LeDuff, ""The brutality of the American rape of the world's exhibition spaces and organs of art-information has distanciated his senses."" Love Titus and his slicing comment about Americans immediately following his claim of maintaining a critical distance from all passions surrounding the debate. And true to form, Titus peppers his writing with words like ""distanciated."" Very much in keeping with art criticism - vocabulary as a weapon to keep the uninitiated outsider out.",93.0,1,3996,11948.04,2.99,622,3,1,3
1934,The List,Steve Martini,1997,2014,"Phoebe Henderson may be single but she sure doesn't feel fabulous. It's been a year since she found her boyfriend Alex in bed with another woman, and multiple cases of wine and extensive relationship analysis with best friend Lucy have done nothing to help. Faced with a new year but no new love, Phoebe concocts a different kind of resolution.
The List: ten things she's always wanted to do in bed but has never had the chance (or the courage!) to try. A bucket list for between the sheets. One year of pleasure, no strings attached. Simple, right?
Factor in meddlesome colleagues, friends with benefits, getting frisky al fresco and maybe, possibly, true love and Phoebe's got her work cut out for her.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,5,9,12,10.0,6,3.94,1074,4.0,"The List is a book that caught my eye because it looked like a story that would be full of hilarious disasters as well as some romance. The List follows the story of Phoebe Henderson, a thirty something woman who's been single for over a year after she found her boyfriend in bed with his boss. The book begin's on New Year's Eve with Phoebe partying in a hotel with her friends as she does every year, but she wants the new year to be different. Instead of making those resolutions that nobody ever keeps like I will go to the gym everyday or I will eat healthier food, she decides she's going to improve her sex life. So, she decides to a create a list of ten things. Ten new things to do in bed that she's never tried before. But first, she's got to find someone to help her... 
 Although the main plot of the book revolves around Phoebe and her sex life, this isn't a work of erotica. Sure, a lot of sexually explicit material but it doesn't quite cross the boundary into erotica and it's by nothing like Fifty Shades of Grey (though there is some bondage involved). I suppose it would be rather interesting to take a feminist slant on The List because it's all about a woman striving for sexual liberation, rather than a boyfriend or a husband. Sex isn't a taboo subject in this novel and it's okay for women to have multiple sexual partners without her seemingly 'easy' or 'slutty'. This story isn't about a woman who just wants to have more sex, it's about a woman who actually wants to make a change in her life and sex is a major part of that. 
 I like that the main character, Phoebe, seems to be a relatively 'normal' person. She's hasn't got some sort of glamorous job or amazing figure, she isn't insanely rich and she doesn't fall in love with a prince. This story is all so ordinary and that's what makes it so good. It isn't 'ordinary' in a bad way, I simply mean that it's slightly more realistic than other novels to the point where I could actually envisage most the characters being real people. This is actually quite a feat since a lot of the characters do very stupid and things throughout, but I never thought 'this is ridiculous'. I guess the fact that this book seems almost 'real' is what makes it so funny. 
 That said, I found the ending to be a little disappointing. I have to admit that I couldn't predict what the ending would be as Bolouri doesn't tie all the lose strings up until the very, very end which means that there are multiple possibilities for an ending throughout and I liked this. However, when it became clear what the ending was going to be, I felt like everything was really rushed and that when I finished reading the book I found myself wanting to know more. As The List is a standalone novel this is a little frustrating. It's not like there was a massive chunk of the story missing or anything, I just wish there had been a few more pages added to the end. 
 All in all, I found The List to be a highly amusing and easy read. I really liked all the characters as they seemed like 'real' people and this made it easy to get into Phoebe's world. Phoebe, as a character, is admirable and I think this book is perfect for women who are in a bit of rut and are looking for that extra push to make a change in their lives. It doesn't have to involve sexual experimentation as it does with Phoebe, but certain aspects of this book are pretty inspiring. If you're the sort of person that feels uncomfortable reading about sex, then this probably isn't the book for you. Then again, like Phoebe, you could be brave and give new things a try!",0.0,0,2916,8718.84,2.99,943,3,2,4
1935,On The Beach,Nevil Shute,1957,1990,"After a nuclear World War III has destroyed most of the globe, the few remaining survivors in southern Australia await the radioactive cloud that is heading their way and bringing certain death to everyone in its path. Among them is an American submarine captain struggling to resist the knowledge that his wife and children in the United States must be dead. Then a faint Morse code signal is picked up, transmitting from somewhere near Seattle, and Captain Towers must lead his submarine crew on a bleak tour of the ruined world in a desperate search for signs of life. On the Beach is a remarkably convincing portrait of how ordinary people might face the most unimaginable nightmare.",Fiction,Intermediate,29,2,15,5.655172413793103,15,3.92,38,5.0,"I loved this. It's one of those classics I'd always intended to read, and with my interest in nuclear apocalypse, one would have thought I'd have read it earlier, but, well, nope. It wasn't until I saw the rather fantastic documentary Fallout about the novel and the film that I remembered it existed, and that I'd never read it. 
 I don't know what there is to say that hasn't been said. I really liked the characters' total inability to accept what the future held, the planning and holding on, and in some cases the total rewriting of the truth. It reminded me in some aspects of the scene in The Time Machine where the Time Traveller finds the museum and muses on the futility of all human endeavour, except that this is a much more visceral rendering of that desperate sense of clutching something that is not going to last. There was a strong sense of country Victoria in the narrative; in the reactions of the characters especially. I was tearful by the end; I think it's hard to get to the end of a book like this and not tear up. 
 One of the things that Fallout says is that a surprising number of world leaders read this, and counted it amongst their favourite novels. I can see why, if only for its bleak warning; still, I don't think we use newspapers intelligently still, and as a denizen of the Southern Hemisphere, I can all-too-easily see destruction wrought upon us down here by our neighbours in the north.",0.0,0,106,589.36,5.56,1251,1,4,5
1936,The Partners,Louis Auchincloss,1974,2005,"They watched Danilo Silva for days before they finally grabbed him. He was living alone, a quiet life on a shady street in Brazil; a simple life in a modest home, certainly not one of luxury. Certainly no evidence of the fortune they thought he had stolen. He was much thinner and his face had been altered. He spoke a different language, and spoke it very well.
But Danilo had a past with many chapters. Four years earlier he had been Patrick Lanigan, a young partner in a prominent Biloxi law firm. He had a pretty wife, a new daughter, and a bright future. Then one cold winter night Patrick was trapped in a burning car and died a horrible death. When he was buried his casket held nothing more than his ashes.
From a short distance away, Patrick watched his own burial. Then he fled. Six weeks later, a fortune was stolen from his ex-law firm's offshore account. And Patrick fled some more.
But they found him.",Fiction,Intermediate,15,5,9,6.4,8,3.89,88030,2.0,"A case study in building tension-- 
 Because Donald Maass speaks highly of him in his Writing the Breakout Novel, I took the time to read the master of tension-building at work. As expected, his prose is insipid at best and characters paper cutouts. I didn't like the ending very much, either. 
 But damn he can tell a story. 
 He withdraws information and feeds it piecemeal, always leaving the reader (and the characters in the story) wanting for more. His pacing is also exquisite in that there was no slow parts except maybe for one part (Jack Stephano's interrogation). The plot was, in other words, masterfully crafted, peppered with surprises and satisfying moments as the bad guys have no choice but to accept the demands of Patrick the scheming bastard. 
 Kudos to Grisham for this gift. 
 Having said this, I was not content with the glaring lack of his love for language. Dialogue, expositions, and emotions of the characters were bland and lacking in substance. After all, my love is for everything literature and language, so although the story was gripping, I wasn't fulfilled.

GOD IS DEAD
MEET THE KIDS
Fat Charlie Nancy is not having a good week. His estranged father recently dropped dead on a karaoke stage and has left Fat Charlie with much more than embarrassment. Because, you see, Charlie has discovered that his dad wasn't just any dad. He was Anansi the trickster spider-god. Anansi is the spirit of rebellion, able to overturn the social order, create wealth out of thin air, and even baffle the devil. No wonder Fat Charlie's life is about to be turned upside down.
Written by one of fiction's most audaciously original talents Anansi Boysis a kaleidoscopic journey deep into myth that is at once startling, terrifying and fiercely funny.
Includes extra material: An interview with Neil Gaiman and reading-group discussion questions.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,3,1,13,7.333333333333333,2,4.01,1919,4.0,"To be quite honest with you, I didn't particularly like the first third of this book. It's got nothing to do with the way it's written (Neil Gaiman is as funny and imaginative as ever), it was something else. The things is, I'm a sucker for sibling relationships and I was pleasantly surprised to find one in this book. But Spider and Fat Charlie spend the first half of this book arguing and generally making each others lives hell and it just made me uncomfortable. There were other things too, like Charlies personality and the plot itself, while not being bad at all, they just didn't appeal to me that greatly. 
 HOWEVER, I continued reading and I am now unbelievably happy I did. After, well, not half the book, but almost, the plot changes. To me it seems as if the books has got two different stories in it, the story of Spider and Charlie's relationship and then the story of everything else. Everything else takes over half way through the book, and it gets really interesting. It also forces Charlie and Spider to start acting like brothers and working together instead of tearing each other apart, and that made me like especially Fat Charlie a lot more. 
 What really turned this book around for me, though, was the ending. I sit here, a day after finishing it, with a feeling of absolute satisfaction. I rarely get that from a book, sure I've read books with brilliant, fantastic endings, books that ended exactly the way I wanted them to, but never one that left me so satisfied on all fronts. I believe the biggest contributive to this feeling is Charlie. The one and only. He undergoes some serious changes in the book, and comes out on the other side as one of my favourite characters in fiction. His change from someone I sort of dislike, to someone I utterly love is so complete, and so brilliantly done, that I can't help but feel satisfied. 
 This is why in the end it gets 4 stars. It wasn't perfect, perhaps, but it was still fantastic. 
 Oh, and perhaps I should mention, I listened to some of the audiobook at one point, and while I'm not usually a fan of this, I was pleased I did it, because it helped me sort out my ""inner Spider"" voice. I'd gotten the way he talks completely wrong, and I liked him a lot better when I got it right. (I know it sounds that weird it should matter that much, but there was really quite a difference between my Spider and the audiobook's Spider. So I can recommend that!)",15.0,1,790,1572.1,1.99,142,2,2,4

1941,A Long Way Down,Nick Hornby,2005,2006,"In his eagerly awaited fourth novel, New York Times-bestselling author Nick Hornby mines the hearts and psyches of four lost souls who connect just when they've reached the end of the line.
Meet Martin, JJ, Jess, and Maureen. Four people who come together on New Year's Eve: a former TV talk show host, a musician, a teenage girl, and a mother. Three are British, one is American. They encounter one another on the roof of Topper's House, a London destination famous as the last stop for those ready to end their lives.
In four distinct and riveting first-person voices, Nick Hornby tells a story of four individuals confronting the limits of choice, circumstance, and their own mortality. This is a tale of connections made and missed, punishing regrets, and the grace of second chances.
Intense, hilarious, provocative, and moving, A Long Way Downis a novel about suicide that is, surprisingly, full of life.
What's your jumping-off point?
Maureen
Why is it the biggest sin of all? All your life you're told that you'll be going to this marvelous place when you pass on. And the one thing you can do to get you there a bit quicker is something that stops you getting there at all. Oh, I can see that it's a kind of queue-jumping. But if someone jumps the queue at the post office, people tut. Or sometimes they say ""Excuse me, I was here first."" They don't say ""You will be consumed by hellfire for all eternity."" That would be a bit strong.
Martin
I'd spent the previous couple of months looking up suicides on the Internet, just out of curiosity. And nearly every single time, the coroner says the same thing: ""He took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed."" And then you read the story about the poor bastard: His wife was sleeping with his best friend, he'd lost his job, his daughter had been killed in a road accident some months before . . . Hello, Mr. Coroner? I'm sorry, but there's no disturbed mental balance here, my friend. I'd say he got it just right.
Jess
I was at a party downstairs. It was a shit party, full of all these ancient crusties sitting on the floor drinking cider and smoking huge spliffs and listening to weirdo space-out reggae. At midnight, one of them clapped sarcastically, and a couple of others laughed, and that was it-Happy New Year to you, too. You could have turned up to that party as the happiest person in London, and you'd still have wanted to jump off the roof by five past twelve. And I wasn't the happiest person in London anyway. Obviously.

New Year's Eve was a night for sentimental losers. It was my own stupid fault. Of course there'd be a low-rent crowd up there. I should have picked a classier date-like March 28, when Virginia Woolf took her walk into the river, or November 25 (Nick Drake).

Overnight, New York has become her sexy late-night play...",Fiction,Novice,2,10,13,11.5,11,3.39,497,1.0,"One of the worst books I've ever read. Stereotypical characters, dull plot consisted of superficial world building, with predictive and anticlimactic ending. The dialogues are unrealistic and immature. And don't even let me start on describing this pathetic excuse for a ""love story"" or spectacular failure of a love triangle. Everything is horrible about this book. 
 Girl quits banking job, because she has been unhappy, gets a job at a PR firm, finds herself to be a star of the tabloids, whining along the way, gets a crush on the guy from a security of some posh club, kisses the guy from security, everything blows up all over their heads, then the girl realizes she hates the backstabbing PR business. 
 The side characters are even more flat and unimpressive than the main character. They have even less personality than Bette, our protagonist. Yes, I'm looking at you Penelope, you were 8 years involved with the guy who'd rather spend every goddamn night of the week drinking with some unimportant acquaintances than with you. Good guys are as superficial and obnoxious as the bad guys. Uncle Will is a shameless gay stereotype and basically has no other trait than being gay. Though the author broke her spine over convincing us how Bette, our protagonist, adjusted to the world of PR, it was obvious she had no idea what the hell she was doing nor how to deal with the complications. I don't even know how she handled the Playboy party when she had been totally incompetent with the task. I admit, I read it only so I could criticize it. 
 In the end, Bette is in the same place she was at the beginning of the book. She has no prospective job, nor she knows who she wants to be in the next five years. She is shallow, self-centered and lifeless main character, who is supposedly fascinating enough for photographers to take her photos everywhere she goes, and tabloids to write bullshit about. I just don't comprehend why this girl can't speak her mind about ANYTHING OR STAND UP FOR HERSELF. But the most ridiculous part of this book was the fact that she went along with every little plan her new boss had for her - from ""dating"" a guy who's blatantly gay and whom she can't stand, to ditching her best friends and family, so she could go the parties because ""it's part of the job"". Oh, give me a break. She had no character development whatsoever, and she willingly agreed to wait three fucking months for a guy who'd go and become successful in his career, while she sits at home in her PJs and eats junk food. She doesn't respect herself and I don't see why anyone else should. 
 For a chick-lit, the romance is almost non-existent and anticlimactic. The central love story is platonic, theatrical and unrealistic to that extent that I wanted to puke. After one kiss and two 5-minute conversations, which weren't that deep, they decided they have a future together, even though there was no situation or conversation in which we'd see if they share same interests or if they're compatible together.

 Troy Phelan, a 78-year-old fabulously wealthy eccentric is sick of living and tired of his money-grubbing relatives who can't wait for him to die so they can partake of his billions. Their grasping has already spawned a legion of lawyers. Phelan has developed a plan to exclude all of them from his will. First he invites a battery of psychiatrists, hired by the family to certify that he is of sound mind -- essential for the family since they assume the extent will will be the one in force at the time of his death -- and after their seal of approval has been dutifully taped and witnessed, he reveals a holographic will to his personal attorney that pays only the debts of family members incurred as of the date of his death.

A clause in his last testament prohibits his attorney from revealing the contents of the will before thirty days are up and all the remaining money, in the billions he leaves to an illegitimate child, Rachel Lane, no one has known of who, for the past eleven years, has been a missionary in the Brazil jungles. 
 The reading of the will tears everything loose. Lawyers begin to belly up to the trough, knowing that whatever the outcome of the will's inevitable challenge -- even though the will had specifically completely disinherited anyone in the family who challenged its provisions -- they will benefit handsomely.

What fun! 
 This book was both more and less wonderful than I'd remembered. More because I'd forgotten just what a superb stylist Robbins is (see mid-read comments). His plots are intricate, his characters are rendered in wonderful detail, down to the distinctive vocal stylings. His ideas, though perhaps a smidge stale twenty-five years on, are still interesting and fun and clever and smart, intellectual, but not in a showy or pedantic way. Plus there's that anxiety you get when you're, oh, twenty or so pages from the end of a book, thinking There's no way he can pull it all together satisfactorily in so few pages! But he does! It's a tiny bit cheesy, maybe just a wee bit pat, but c'mon. He had an awful lot of balls in the air. 
 Less for a few reasons. I'd kindly blocked out the fact that everyone in a Tom Robbins novel sooner or later launches into a discourse that sounds exactly like Tom Robbins, which can get pretty annoying. Also, I forgot how letchy he can be. There's a lot of sex in this book - in fact, it's one of the four pillars of immortality - which is fine; it's just that the descriptions of it are often a bit much. (""Alma hiccupped the mushroom scent of his spurt,"" ex, not to mention lots of glistening, semen-encrusted thighs, and that sort of thing.) 
 The other thing, which isn't really bad or good, exactly, is that I think Tom Robbins is kind of a victim of himself. He's too much Tom Robbins sometimes. Too hippie-cliche; too cerebral-in-an-understandable-but-trippy-way; too specific with his characters, to the point where they become caricatures that are hard to take seriously; even, sadly, too over-the-top with his metaphors (""his knuckle began rapping at his eye patch like a mongoloid woodpecker drilling for worms in a poker chip""? Are you kidding?); just too... too much. 
 I guess taking a few years off between Robbinses allows one to forget these drawbacks just enough to come back to him fresh and be able to enjoy his shimmering originality again. 
 mid-read: It's not that I'd forgotten, exactly, but no one does metaphors like Tom Robbins. For example: The sky was a velvety black paw pressing on the snowy landscape with a feline delicacy, stars flying like sparks from its fur. Fuck, really??

None of this makes vice cop Joe Morelli a happy man. The cop in him can't help but wonder as to the source of Stephanie's expensive new cars. And the rest of him, the man who's been friend and lover to Stephanie, can't help but wonder if there's more to the partnership than meets the eye.
The internship is downgraded to second priority when Uncle Fred goes missing. Even though Grandma Mazur is sure he was abducted by aliens, Stephanie sets out to look for Fred. He's a perfectly average senior citizen, and he's disappeared without a trace while running errands. He's left his ten-year-old Pontiac station wagon locked up nice and neat in the Grand Union parking lot, the cleaning is carefully arranged on the back seat, and his wife is at home, waiting for him to return with the bread and the milk and the olive loaf bologna. Locked in the top drawer of his desk are photos of a body, dismembered and stuffed into a garbage bag. And locked away in the computer files of a another average citizen are the clues that will lead Stephanie to Fred.",Children,Excellent,2,13,15,14.0,14,4.17,7,4.0,"People aren't jumping bail, so Stephanie's working for Ranger in some of his other, mostly sorta not quite legal businesses in order to make ends meet.

This time an eccentric billionaire Troy Phelan(One of my favorite Grisham characters ever) jumps out of a window to his death, after writing a new will, leaving his $11 Billion estate in limbo. 
 Despite being fully engaged by the story, there are a few things I didn't like about the book. I found the main character Nate O'reilly completely unsympathetic. I was very disappointed that the story started out with such a bang and then ended with a whimper. Once again, Grisham could have used a better editor.

He has his choice of princesses. Unfortunately, his passion is for princes. Havyn has been a slave all his life. When his powers are discovered, he finds himself purchased and freed by a Prince and apprenticed to the royal wizard, Ildar. His duty is to stay chaste to keep his powers strong. Unfortunately, his passion is for Severin. With kingdoms at war, the throne hanging in the balance, and magic in the air, can the two men find happiness together, or is duty more important than love?",Fiction,Excellent,1,3,10,4.425,6,3.21,31,3.0,"The Chosen is a classic fantasy novel but without the epic length. Included are long journeys, prophesies, royalty, magic, oracles, wars at stake, forbidden love, runaway elopements, long lost princes, lengthy quests, true love, and a happy ending. Because the story stays pretty true to the fantasy origins, there is not originality offered but for those fans of the genre, the familiar themes are always welcome. The writing makes the story incredibly easy and fast to read so that kept my interest whereas if the pace had dragged I would have been bored. The characters are again right out of fantasy lore so nothing surprising but they are warm and likable. As a first novel, this is a decent fantasy offering that may be of interest to classic fantasy tales. 
 Severin is a prince out on a journey with his faithful wizard Ildar to find himself after a lifetime of being spoiled at his parent's whim. Severin buys Havyn at a slave auction, intending to free the man once they return to his home. Along the way, they discover Havyn has magical ability and Ildar quickly makes the ex-slave his new wizard's apprentice. Life isn't easy once they reach home though as Severin is set to wed the niece of a neighboring land, yet his chemistry with Havyn causes havoc for both. When the royal family and entourage set out for the betrothal ceremony, there is no end of problems. Murder, intrigue, runaways, long lost royalty, quests, true love, and a happy ending are all involved as the various characters find their way in this realm of magic and mystery. 
 There is a lot going on in this story but surprisingly, the plot never feels overwhelmed or too fast. Each issue brought up is well handled and builds upon the next so each piece is simply part of a bigger, more complicated whole. Some of the elements are pretty predictable and the story on the whole isn't wildly original. Often the plot feels obvious as the fantasy themes used are easy to identify so there is not a lot of suspense or wonder associated with reading. Yet the writing keeps the pace quick and characters interesting enough that even those who have read this type of story all the time will keep turning the page here. 
 Part of this is that the characters are pretty decent. Severin and Havyn narrate the story in alternating third person point of view and for the most part they stay well within the predictable roles. Havyn is slightly over the top with the orphan childhood sold into slavery from birth and never known a bath, clothing, food, or kindness. However this exaggeration is pretty typical of everyone in the book. All the characters seem to exist on the extremes of their description and supposedly almost all are virgins, which is necessary to fill their various roles. This is a bit of a stretch especially at the end when several of these mandates are flipped to provide a happy ending, but it didn't really bother me since it was clearly coming. 
 The various characters have a bit of charm, a bit of scheming, and some interest which kept me reading even though I knew what would happen - usually a sign I give up and become bored. Yet again, there's an ease to the writing that lets you enjoy the classic tale even if there is nothing surprising. The common themes are well loved for a reason and even though just about all used here, it pretty much works. This isn't a book that leaves you breathless but it is one you enjoy while reading.

After all, it includes such amazing tales as The Mist and The Jaunt. It must be amazeballs, right? Not so much. Even the epically awesome stories in this collection need to be trimmed down. Most of them start slower than a Lars Von Trier movie, and over half of them never really pay off. There are some serious WTF stories within this collection; stories I didn't understand ten years ago and still do not understand today. In other words, the reread didn't help. That doesn't mean your experience will not be different. It does not mean you will not understand the Milkman stories or appreciate King's cute-ass poem about anthropomorphized fruit that he wrote for his youngest son Owen. I understand why they are in this collection, but that doesn't mean I have to like them. Mostly, this collection is tedious. But, some of the time, if you can wade through the first unmpteen pages of bullshit, you might find a scare or two, or a meaningful story surrounded by bloat. 
 Here are my one-sentence reviews of each story. Feel free to discuss your favorites in the comment section. 
 The Mist - Five epically-awesome stars for this tale of mist-borne monsters and flawed fathers. 
 Here There Be Tygers - Three stars for this story about toileting ""tygers"" and tasty teachers. 
 The Monkey - Two stars for this mostly mediocre, meandering monkey, because this one has never really scared me, but it sure has bored me. 
 Cain Rose Up - Three confused stars because I don't know why this story is still in publication and Rage is not. 
 Mrs. Todd's Shortcut - Four stars for what could be the inspiration for Lisey's Story, because Boo'ya Moon could very well be Mrs. Todd's escape route. 
 The Jaunt - Five stars for this tale that takes cues from The Langoliers. 
 The Wedding Gig - Four stars for this story that fits the Hard Case Crimes series better than both The 
 Colorado Kid and Joyland put together. 
 Paranoid: A Chant - I'm sure this piece is brilliant and I'm just too stupid to understand it, but yeah, one star. 
 The Raft - All the stars (Five, Six... Ten... a Hundred) for what continues to be one of my favorite stories of all time. 
 The Word Processor of the Gods - Gets three stars for being The Monkey's Paw with a happy ending. 
 The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands - Finds three stars because the boys from 249B East 35th are still telling tales, even after Emlyn McCarron told them about The Breathing Method. 
 Beachworld - Beachfront property this ain't, but one helluva four-star story it is. 
 The Reaper's Image - This three-star story seems like the inspiration for that horrible Oculus movie. 
 Nona - Gets four-stars for being darkly dubious. 
 For Owen - If I were King's kid I would expect something better than this two-star cutesy crap from my old man. 
 Survivor Type - While you'll never see Richard Pine on Food Network, his cooking gets five stars. 
 Uncle Otto's Truck - Two stars for this done-to-death concept about a killer car. 
 Morning Deliveries (Milkman #1) - One star for this outline of an idea for a possible short story. 
 Big Wheels: A Tale of the Laundry Game (Milkman #2) - If someone would like to explain this story and its predecessor to me, I might give it more than one star. 
 Gramma - Four-stars for this creepy motherfucker because the beginning is slow as hell, but that ending... *shivers* 
 The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet - This one starts even slower than Gramma but its payoff only raises it into three-star territory. 
 The Reach - Stephen King says he wants to be remembered for this four-star beauty of a story, but he's done much better, at least in my opinion he has. 
 In summation: Skeleton Crew has a few gems, but is, overall, just okay.

Flight Behavior transfixes from its opening scene, when a young woman's narrow experience of life is thrown wide with the force of a raging fire. In the lyrical language of her native Appalachia, Barbara Kingsolver bares the rich, tarnished humanity of her novel's inhabitants and unearths the modern complexities of rural existence. Characters and reader alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory here, into the unsettled ground of science, faith, and everyday truces between reason and conviction.
Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen. Now, after a decade of domestic disharmony on a failing farm, she has settled for permanent disappointment but seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation with a younger man. As she hikes up a mountain road behind her house to a secret tryst, she encounters a shocking sight: a silent, forested valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand it as a cautionary miracle, but it sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists, religious leaders, and the media. The bewildering emergency draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists, opportunists, sightseers, and a striking biologist with his own stake in the outcome. As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle, Dellarobia confronts her family, her church, her town, and a larger world, in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed.

It is really a whirlwind of a book, one major event after another just keeps on happening to Allegra, her family, or one of her clients (Allegra is an entertaiment attorney). It is rather fast paced for the most part, which to me, is pretty typical for a DS novel. I have to say, so much of this is rather unrealistic, the fact that so many major things keep happening, no one person in real life could possibly have all these kinds of things going on in their life.

And sometimes, it turns out, the key to a great marriage is not its truths but its secrets. At the core of this rich, expansive, layered novel, Lauren Groff presents the story of one such marriage over the course of twenty-four years.
At age twenty-two, Lotto and Mathilde are tall, glamorous, madly in love, and destined for greatness. A decade later, their marriage is still the envy of their friends, but with an electric thrill we understand that things are even more complicated and remarkable than they have seemed.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,7,14,10.77777777777778,3,3.56,68846,2.0,"This book was a HUGE disappointment. I mean, holy purple prose, Batman! I really loved Lauren Groff's writing in Arcadia - it was beautiful and touching, with gorgeous metaphors. But Fates and Furies is pretentious and overwritten. It tries so hard to be a literary masterpiece that you end up with asides like this one: 
 Her mother had smelled of cold and scales, her father of stone dust and dog. She imagined her husband's mother, whom she had never met, had a whiff of rotting apples, although her stationery had stunk of baby powder and rose perfume. Sallie was starch, cedar. Her dead grandmother, sandalwood. Her uncle, Swiss cheese. People told her she smiled like garlic, like chalk, like nothing at all. Lotto, clean as camphor at his neck and belly, like electrified pennies at the armpit, like chlorine at the groin. 
 If you like convoluted metaphors and improbable life stories, you will enjoy this book. If you like reading descriptions of fictional avant-garde plays that add modernist touches to ancient stories (think Antigone transformed into ""Go""), you will enjoy this book. But most importantly, if you like the grotesque, you will enjoy this book. The entire thing is a bizarre parody of what two people's life stories could actually be like, and the fantastical, absurd elements are what really stand out. 
 The narrative constantly asks us: what is given up by each party in a relationship? What is worth giving up for a marriage, and how can two people stay together? There were a few poignant scenes where I really felt like Groff had captured this for Lotto and Mathilde, and I actually felt invested in their relationship: 
 Great swaths of her life were white space to her husband. What she did not tell him balanced neatly with what she did. Still, there are untruths made of words and untruths made of silences, and Mathilde had only ever lied to Lotto in what she never said. 
 But even that fell apart for me given how ridiculous I found most of the book. Serious ""plot"" spoilers behind tags: I probably should have stopped reading this in the first hundred pages, when in the space of a few pages, a fourteen-year-old boy first discovers the suicide of his classmate, and then his drama teacher (who - surprise! - sparks his love of acting) gives him a surprise, consolatory blow job in the high school gym . Or when I realized that Chollie (god) was a character who was actually going to stick around for awhile. Or when I got to Mathilde's half of the book, which is supposed to humanize her and round out the narrative, when really it just had me raising my eyebrows for a solid 200 pages. 
 The implication that married couples have secrets from each other is a sensible one; the idea that Mathilde had her tubes tied and then listened to Lotto talk about children for three decades is not . And something about Mathilde's self-sacrifice really rubbed me the wrong way. Near the end of the book, Mathilde begins to write plays as well, including one called Volumnia. The book blatantly tries to sell us that it's unsuccessful because Mathilde as a woman gave up so much for Lotto's success (Volumnia is always more interesting than Coriolanus, but who would go to see that play?, etc.). But after reaching the end of the book, I vehemently disagree. Lotto is a bumbling sex-focused idiot for most of the book--it's Mathilde who's cleaning up his plays, drawing on her connections to get the plays made, and managing his success. If she had put the same amount of effort or time into her own work, she would have been just as successful. I get that her past is supposed to make her look for something ""good"" and she doesn't believe she deserves the success, but the attempt to talk about her own art as secondary to Lotto's falls flat. That is a choice that she made, and it's not a choice that would have ruined the marriage. Or if it had, so what? 
 Ultimately I really hated these two people, hated the amount of dubious underage sex presented as normal, and came away thinking the entire novel just tries too way, way too hard.",680.0,1,36504,266844.24,7.31,792,5,3,3
1963,White Teeth,Zadie Smith,2000,2001,"On New Year's morning, 1975, Archie Jones sits in his car on a London road and waits for the exhaust fumes to fill his Cavalier Musketeer station wagon. Archie--working-class, ordinary, a failed marriage under his belt--is calling it quits, the deciding factor being the flip of a 20-pence coin. When the owner of a nearby halal butcher shop (annoyed that Archie's car is blocking his delivery area) comes out and bangs on the window, he gives Archie another chance at life and sets in motion this richly imagined, uproariously funny novel.
Epic and intimate, hilarious and poignant, White Teethis the story of two North London families--one headed by Archie, the other by Archie's best friend, a Muslim Bengali named Samad Iqbal. Pals since they served together in World War II, Archie and Samad are a decidedly unlikely pair. Plodding Archie is typical in every way until he marries Clara, a beautiful, toothless Jamaican woman half his age, and the couple have a daughter named Irie (the Jamaican word for ""no problem""). Samad --devoutly Muslim, hopelessly ""foreign""-- weds the feisty and always suspicious Alsana in a prearranged union. They have twin sons named Millat and Magid, one a pot-smoking punk-cum-militant Muslim and the other an insufferable science nerd. The riotous and tortured histories of the Joneses and the Iqbals are fundamentally intertwined, capturing an empire's worth of cultural identity, history, and hope.
Zadie Smith's dazzling first novel plays out its bounding, vibrant course in a Jamaican hair salon in North London, an Indian restaurant in Leicester Square, an Irish poolroom turned immigrant cafe, a liberal public school, a sleek science institute. A winning debut in every respect, White Teethmarks the arrival of a wondrously talented writer who takes on the big themes --faith, race, gender, history, and culture-- and triumphs.",Fiction,Intermediate,3,14,16,15.0,5,3.75,84311,3.0,"You lose a star for fat-shaming.

It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, Ulysses is also a compulsively readable book.
William Blake saw the universe in a grain of sand. Joyce saw it in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904, a day distinguished by its utter normality. Two characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, go about their separate business, crossing paths with a gallery of indelible Dubliners. We watch them teach, eat, stroll the streets, argue, and (in Bloom's case) masturbate. And thanks to the book's stream-of-consciousness technique--which suggests no mere stream but an impossibly deep, swift-running river--we're privy to their thoughts, emotions, and memories. The result? Almost every variety of human experience is crammed into the accordian folds of a single day, which makes Ulysses not just an experimental work but the very last word in realism.
Considered the greatest 20th century novel written in English, in this edition Walter Gabler uncovers previously unseen text.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,2,6,4.555555555555555,6,3.74,1500,5.0,"It took ten weeks, but I made it, more or less unscathed, through Ulysses. What hasn't been said about this book? I don't feel any need to try to be original here; I guess as far as recommending this, you'll either adore it or you'll despise it. The Circe, Nausicaa, and Penelope chapters alone are worth the price/toil of admission. Getting through some chapters, admittedly, proved to be a Herculean task (I won't name names so as not to predispose you on that front), and Joyce's voice/style/narrative technique (whatever you wish to call it, and it seems a bit reductive to say his 'technique' when each section mutates and becomes something entirely other) is, as they say, quite difficult. If you can make it through the first four chapters, you'll have no trouble getting through Ulysses in its entirety, which isn't to say they're the 'hardest' but that by that point, you've either become accustomed to it (and feel that you've already put enough effort in that you need to finish) or you've decided it's the literary equivalent of a barrel of bricks, which it will begin to feel like when you lug it and the Annotated Guide around in your backpack everyday for upwards of two months. 
 Leopold and Molly Bloom are two of the most distinctive figures in literature--something I'd always heard but somehow assumed couldn't be true because of the way people talk of them. Stephen I'm iffy on; I want to find him alluring, but most I was just ambivalent to or irritated by him. The bit characters pop in and out, are fully-fleshed or never explained, and are often just as fascinating. I'm particularly taken with Mrs. Breen, for some reason. But you'll certainly remember them by the end of it all. 
 As I said, I don't wish to be pretentious here. I read it for a class, which is likely the only thing that would have forced me to trudge through it--and I'm very glad I was coerced. It's not just one of the most glamorous notches on a lit scholar's belt, but a really fucking great text. Often literally belly-achingly funny; at other moments, it leaves you feeling entirely hollow and pointless. It will make you work, there's no doubt about that, but I do think the payoff justifies the effort. My professor left us with this thought on Ulysses: Joyce refigures the classical hero as a mostly ordinary man who makes it through the day with no great losses or gains, which in itself becomes epic; simply getting by is the great journey of the text. I liked this notion, though there are a million other things to pick up on, and it's something that I think will stick with me for some time to come.",1.0,0,36936,36566.64,0.99,786,5,4,5

Feanor dan kaum kerabatnya mengangkat senjata dan mengobarkan perang dahsyat yang berlangsung sangat lama, untuk

Buku ini terbagi ke dalam 5 bagian dan semuanya memang sebuah riwayat atau sejarah yang begitu panjang mengenai dunia yang direka oleh Tolkien. Dia memulainya dengan cerita mengenai penciptaan. Ada (katakanlah) Tuhan, lalu diciptakanlah (katakanlah) malaikat/dewa-dewa. Kemudian disusul pula dengan pengkhianatan (katakanlah setan) dan berikut penciptaan Elves, kurcaci, dan manusia. Ez sempat melihat sekilas isi buku ini dan berkomentar, ""kok, buku ini nggak ada dialognya?"" Haha, ya memang, sebagian besar kisah Quenta Silmarillion minim dialog. Lebih kepada bertutur, bernarasi. Dialognya menyelip sedikit. Oleh karenanya kubisa mengatakan jika ini buku besar sejarah serta riwayat dunia rekaannya Tolkien. Buku ini jugalah yang mendahului kisah-kisah di The Hobbit dan The Lord of the Rings. 
 Kaum Noldor, terutama Feanor (anaknya Finwe) sangat pandai membuat permata. Dialah yang membuat ketiga permata Silmaril yang di dalamnya mengandung cahaya dari kedua pohon. Permata tersebut dikuduskan atau bertuah. Petaka dimulai ketika Melkor bersama laba-laba raksasa purba bernama Ungoliant, menghancurkan pohon cahaya di Valinor. Kegelapan pun menyelimuti bumi dan pohon tersebut hanya bisa dipulihkan dengan bantuan permata Silmaril. Namun Feanor menjadi posesif terhadap permata tersebut dan menolak perintah Valar. Akan tetapi Melkor ternyata lebih duluan mencurinya dan membawa lari permata tersebut ke Middle Earth yang gelap. Feanor dan keturunannya termasuk Maedhros (putra sulungnya) memutuskan untuk keluar dari Valinor. Mereka mengucapkan sumpah yang menghantui diri mereka sendiri di kemudian hari. Dan salah satu vala pun mengutuk mereka dengan kesialan. Mereka, kaum Elves Noldor pun menjadi kaum elves Yang Terusir. 
 Ya, tidak banyak yang bisa kubahas mengenai buku ini. Terkadang memang susah membuat review buku-buku yang melibatkan perasaan dan kekaguman seperti buku ini, haha. Memang bukan buku yang bisa dibilang sempurna namun aku menyukainya. Silakan langsung kalian coba baca sendiri, ya. Apalagi jika kalian memang penggemar kisah dunia yang di-reka oleh Tolkien.

 I find it hard to review these books. How do you review books that are Fantasy classics? These are books that everybody already knows are good. I find it difficult to express how great these books are. I mean besides Lord of the Rings this has to be considered the best classic Epic Fantasy right? Well I guess I will just take it book by book and see what happens. This is yet another great book in this series. What a wonderful story. Awesome characters. The worldbuilding is just fantastic. Robert Jordan deserves his reputation as the outstanding author he was. This series deserves it's place near the top of all epic fantasy. The adventures of Rand, Perrin, and Mat are truly epic. Classic fantasy at it's best. You have reluctant heroes, Dark powers, magic, diverse people, and great battles. 
 Overall another great book in the series. It has some wonderfully memorable moments. It is also is beginning to slow down a bit. I don't mind so much because I am so attached to the characters and the story, but I can see were all the complaining comes from. I am looking forward to continuing this fantastic series. 
 The only regret I have with this book, and the series is that I did not read it sooner! I can see now that I am going to be obsessed with this series. I finally know what all the hype was about from all the WoT fans out there. Now I am one of you. I wanted to read the whole series this year (As you can see I am very behind). 
 As you know if you have read my reviews before I am not about long reviews with synopsis and spoilers. I just give my opinion on my experience with this book and you can take it from there. Now on to the next book.

 I really liked the atmosphere and the ideas in Night Watch. It was so different from American urban fantasy. It's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys, even though they are clearly labeled. I really felt like I was in a magical Moscow. 
 What I didn't like was how disjointed it seemed. I think it must have originally been three novellas that were put together as a novel. While the three stories were sequential and had a story arc, they still seemed like three individual stories. I normally don't mind this technique, but I found it jarring in this case. I also found Anton to be a bit to naive to be believable. Although I was walking around in his head, I didn't feel like I really knew him.

AUTHOR'S FOREWORD
You might not want to buy this book.
I know, that's not the sort of thing an author is supposed to say. The marketing people aren't going to like this. My editor is going to have a fit. But I'd rather be honest with you right out of the gate.
First, if you haven't read my other books, you don't want to start here.
My first two books are The Name of the Windand The Wise Man's Fear. If you're curious to try my writing, start there. They're the best introduction to my world. This book deals with Auri, one of the characters from that series. Without the context of those books, you're probably going to feel pretty lost.
Second, even if you have read my other books, I think it's only fair to warn you that this is a bit of a strange story. I don't go in for spoilers, but suffice to say that this one is ... different. It doesn't do a lot of the things a classic story is supposed to do. And if you're looking for a continuation of Kvothe's storyline, you're not going to find it here.
On the other hand, if you'd like to learn more about Auri, this story has a lot to offer. If you love words and mysteries and secrets. If you're curious about the Underthing and alchemy. If you want to know more about the hidden turnings of my world...
Well, then this book might be for you.",Fiction,Intermediate,4,2,14,7.75,11,3.91,107,1.0,"I kind of wish I didn't read this. Despite the fact that this is the sort of thing I could totally love, I much preferred Auri with a bit more mystery.",0.0,0,4240,16917.600000000002,3.99,1156,4,3,2
1970,The Dead Zone,Stephen King,1979,1979,"It was as if his eyes were awake, and the rest of him still slept
Meet Johnny Smith. A young man whose streak of luck ends dramatically in a major car crash. Followed by blackness. A long, long time in cold limbo.
When he wakes up life has been turned upside down. His fiancee has met someone else. And Johnny is cursed with the power to perceive evil in men's souls. He's had these hunches since he had an ice-skating accident as a child. Now he has an ability to see into the future. An ability which will bring him into a terrifying confrontation with a charismatic, power-hungry and dangerous man...",Fiction,Intermediate,32,1,14,7.75,4,3.9,1135,4.0,"Johnny Smith is one bad-luck bastard. 
 He starts off well enough as a nice guy with a talent for teaching and is in the early stages of what looks to be a very promising relationship with Sarah. However, a car accident leaves Johnny in a coma which nobody thinks he'll recover from. Miraculously, he wakes up 4 years later, but he finds that Sarah has married someone else, his mother has turned into a religious lunatic, he's got a long and painful rehab to endure, and he faces a mountain of debt from his hospital bills. Oh, and he now has psychic ability to learn details about a person by touching them or personal objects as well as sometimes seeing their futures. This might seem like a gift, but as Johnny quickly learns it's really a curse that eventually puts him on a collision course with a dangerous politician named Greg Stillson. 
 I've always thought this was one of King's better books but hadn't read it for years. A new audio version with James Franco narrating and doing a pretty good job of it got me motivated, and I'm pleased to find that it mostly lives up to my memory of it. 
 The elephant in the room on this one is that even though it was published in 1979 the Stillson plot is about a populist demagogue who manages to rise in politics despite being a crazy and corrupt piece of shit just because he has talent for making rubes think that he's a maverick who tells it like it is even as they willfully ignore the obvious warning signs. So it'd be easy to say that King is a prophet these days. Yeah, he hit the mark with that one, but on the other hand there's plenty of writers who have done stories about shady politicians. 
 What I found more interesting here is what King did with Johnny's mother, Vera. She starts out as someone with strong fundamental religious beliefs, but Johnny's accident sends her over the high side and into the realm where she starts believing tabloid stories about Jesus living underground at the South Pole. She's completely immune to facts and logic, and she'd rather rely on prayer than medication to handle her high blood pressure. 
 It's fascinating to read a character like this in the '70s setting where tabloids and poorly printed tracts are how Vera gets her crackpot theories, and how even then she uses them to create her own view of the world because reality doesn't suit her. Fast forward to the 21st century where some people pick their news web sites based on how it conforms to what they want to believe as they spread rumors on Facebook about child sex rings in the basement of pizza restaurants that don't even have a basement, and you realize that King had tapped into something that was on the rise even then. 
 Leaving aside the eerie similarities to America today, what sets this apart from his other novels is the way that King focused on John Smith and made his story a genuine tragedy. Johnny just wanting to try and resume some kind of normal life, but unable to stop himself from using his power to help people and put himself in a media spotlight is incredibly compelling. 
 Uncle Stevie takes his sweet time with this so that it comes across as more a slow burn, and it's not really a horror novel although it can be creepy at times. You can see where the bigger plot involving Johnny and Stillson is headed for a good long while although King still makes the journey there worth the trip, and Johnny is one of his characters who haunts me the most.",99.0,1,760,1512.4,1.99,148,2,4,3

 Tak 
 As a constant King reader, I was looking forward to diving into his twisted mindset again, for believe it or not this was my first King book this year and immediately from page one it felt like home. The whole setting for this book lends itself well to the extreme creepy factor from the ghost town in the middle of a desert to the long stretches of highway that just give this unsettling feeling like something bad is about happen.

 The plot revolves around this isolated town called Desperation which is located in Nevada, it seems deserted and the only inhabitant is the sheriff who patrols Highway 50 where a bunch of outsiders will, unfortunately, cross paths with the devil himself. Somehow, they get pulled over for some sort of technicality with the law and are brought to Desperation and all hell breaks loose. 
 My experience reading this polarizing, before starting this I read that the book was too heavy on the religiousness or ""preachy"" and I was still not put off by that because The Stand also drew some inspiration from the Bible and used that to explore the Good vs Evil trope it was done smartly and the characters didn't feel like biblical prophets but when it came to this book it felt like I was literally being talked down at. The plot was steady and the suspense was incredible as one would expect with a King but the second half the religious ideologies overtook the storyline. 
 ""In these silences, something may rise"" 
 The characters had a similar effect with the plot, at the beginning each individual had such a strong presence but they slowly dwindled... The whole idea of free will in regards to religion was touched on but once the characters started losing their own personal belief and started making really dumb decisions my enjoyment level started plummeting. 
 Apart from all that the book is really fast paced, devouring the 700pages in a weeks time and the gore factor was top notch. Exploring addiction and alcoholism was well done as the subject hits close to home for Stephen King. I would definitely still recommend it for the sharp writing and atmosphere but it isn't like my favorite King book, I have read better. Still, you sound check it out if the premise sounds interesting or if you are King addict. 
 I would definitely check out The Regulators to see how the narratives pair together.

No wonder the book finds mention in both the top 100 mystery/crime novel lists published by the Britain-based Crime Writers' Association and by the Mystery Writers of America. Both the lists were published in the nineties and feature some of the finest specimens of crime writing. The lists can be found here - Link 
 The story is narrated by Rozat K. Sabich aka Rusty, chief deputy prosecutor of Kindle county who is also the protagonist. The story begins with the murder of Carolyn, another prosecuting attorney, with whom Rusty had an affair and never got over his obsession of her. Rusty gets the responsibility of investigating the crime but himself ends up getting accused of the murder and faces trial. 
 The book features some really great court room scenes, complex characters and portrays so many human emotions and frailties. Illicit passion, betrayal, corruption, dirty politics, jealousy, friendship, paternal feelings, family bonds - everything finds a place in the story. The author has also explained quite a few legal technicalities which makes it easier for the reader to understand some of the complexities of the trial. The mystery is excellent and the very few would be able to guess the identity of the culprit. 
 Rusty, accustomed to putting criminals behind bars, is now the accused and feels how is it to be on the other side. He talks about his obsession with Carolyn, his childhood, his strained relationship with his wife, his fear of missing out his son's childhood if he is sent to prison. Some of his ramblings is actually a bit boring and do not fit in the story.The author's use of the English language is impressive but somehow I felt at times it was not compatible with the character or the story. e.g. a person, who is a prosecutor not a poet, facing a murder charge is unlikely to use phrases like ""doors and windows of my soul are thrown open to a fundamental gratitude"". It is my only criticism of the novel. 
 The book is not just a thriller but Scott Turow's attempt to explore the intricacies of the human mind and he has done a commendable job. I would recommend the book to lovers of legal thrillers, murder mysteries, psychological thrillers if he/she does not mind the ramblings of the protagonist.",52.0,1,4995,14935.05,2.99,479,4,5,5
1978,The Silkworm,Robert Galbraith,2014,2015,"Private investigator Cormoran Strike returns in a new mystery from Robert Galbraith, author of the #1 international bestseller The Cuckoo's Calling.
When novelist Owen Quine goes missing, his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike. At first, Mrs. Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few days--as he has done before--and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home.
But as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine's disappearance than his wife realizes. The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous pen-portraits of almost everyone he knows. If the novel were to be published, it would ruin lives--meaning that there are a lot of people who might want him silenced.
When Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike any Strike has encountered before...

1979,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,Seth Grahame-Smith,2010,2012,"Indiana, 1818. Moonlight falls through the dense woods that surround a one-room cabin, where a nine-year-old Abraham Lincoln kneels at his suffering mother's bedside. She's been stricken with something the old-timers call ""Milk Sickness.""
""My baby boy..."" she whispers before dying.
Only later will the grieving Abe learn that his mother's fatal affliction was actually the work of a vampire.
When the truth becomes known to young Lincoln, he writes in his journal, ""henceforth my life shall be one of rigorous study and devotion. I shall become a master of mind and body. And this mastery shall have but one purpose..."" Gifted with his legendary height, strength, and skill with an ax, Abe sets out on a path of vengeance that will lead him all the way to the White House.
While Abraham Lincoln is widely lauded for saving a Union and freeing millions of slaves, his valiant fight against the forces of the undead has remained in the shadows for hundreds of years. That is, until Seth Grahame-Smith stumbled upon The Secret Journal of Abraham Lincoln, and became the first living person to lay eyes on it in more than 140 years.
Using the journal as his guide and writing in the grand biographical style of Doris Kearns Goodwin and David McCullough, Seth has reconstructed the truelife story of our greatest president for the first time-all while revealing the hidden history behind the Civil War and uncovering the role vampires played in the birth, growth, and near-death of our nation.",Fiction,Intermediate,7,4,15,8.0,6,3.7,1643,5.0,"""Without death,"" he answered, ""life is meaningless. It is a story that can never be told. A song that can never be sung. For how would one finish it?"" 
 Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is an impeccable example of how history can be made interesting with strategy. Even though I'm vastly interested in history, reading huge textbooks or listening to commentaries still makes me sleepy. I've read about how Lincoln died many times now, from different sources, but I never understood why it happened. I also never really knew much about him other than he was a former U.S President. I'm sure that if I grew up in the U.S then I would have vast knowledge of him, but sadly I didn't. I heard that this book was heavily researched on, so I'm guessing I now have at least a brief introduction on who Lincoln was as a President. Events were obviously coated with the vampire-fantasy gimmick, but I still see some as real events that happened. 
 Before reading this I already knew I was going to enjoy it. The premise was straightforward and it caught my interest immediately. Despite numerous 1-2 star reviews, I went ahead and decided to read this book anyway. Such a great decision I made. 
 The writing was near perfect. The way that the author alternated from his narration and Lincoln's journal was very interesting. If it was an attempt to maintain the reader's interest, then he clearly succeeded, at least with me. I'm clearly happy with the historical vibe of the novel, and the way that it didn't venture out of it. Some other authors would mistakenly write about things that are not present in the time that they're trying to portray. I didn't see anything wrong with SG-S' writing, so I'm clearly satisfied. 
 The plot was in parr with the premise. It showed Lincoln's life, as a vampire hunter. A parody but life lessons were still present. That's the great thing about reading fiction, not only does it interest you, but it also teaches. If I were to quote all of the things I thought were life lessons then this review wouldn't be a review, but rather a short preview. All you need to know is that it was really amazing. Here's one of my favorites though: 
 """"Judge us not equally, Abraham, We may all deserve hell, but some of us deserve it sooner than others."" 
 The characters were all interesting and genuine. Genuine in a way that they weren't pretentious. The author also didn't make them seem unbelievable. Another reason why I like the writing of this novel. Also the way that Abe developed was really good. It was very well incorporated to the vampire aspect of the novel. No cheesy vampire romance here. The vampires are violent and merciless. I would also like it mention that the author was rather harsh with the outcome of some characters. I'm not sure if they really happened, but the harshness managed to interest me too. I don't have a faint heart, and the darker the novel the better, for me. 
 I can't wait the read the sequel of this. I heard though that it can be read as a standalone, considering it's Henry's point of view, and that makes me even more excited. I really liked Henry here, so reading about the what he decides to do after Abraham's death is clearly exciting. I'm glad the author made a sequel about him. 
 5/5 stars. This is my first read of Seth Grahame-Smith, and clearly it's not going to be my last. He managed to exceed my expectations. I don't give out 5 stars that often, but this novel clearly deserves it. Highly recommended. Will probably read this again in the future.",65.0,1,348,344.52,0.99,291,1,4,4

 he just never fails. 
 this is just a short little work, part of melville house's wonderful ""art of the novella"" series, but it is machado, so you know it is going to be wholly satisfying, despite being only 86 pages. 
 this one is about... madness. and how you don't want one person in charge of determining who is crazy and who is not. especially not this man: 
 In his fortieth year Bacamarte married the widow of a circuit judge. Her name was Dona Evarista da Costa e Mascarenhas, and she was neither beautiful nor charming. One of his uncles, an outspoken man, asked him why he had not selected a more attractive woman. The doctor replied that Dona Evarista enjoyed perfect digestion, excellent eyesight, and normal blood pressure; she had had no serious illnesses and her urinalysis was negative. It was likely she would give him healthy, robust children. If, in addition to her physiological accomplishments, Dona Evarista possessed a face composed of features neither individually pretty nor mutually compatible, he thanked God for it, for he would not be tempted to sacrifice his scientific pursuits for the contemplation of his wife's attractions. 
 because any man who is that clinical and impassive, that removed from ordinary human sentiment, is not the person i want telling me what sanity is. and by the end, you will be wishing he had just married a hotter wife. this is a man who needs distractions. 
 alas, instead of enjoying marital bliss with a fascinating woman, bacamarte instead sets out to single-mindedly diagnose the citizens of itaguai with their heretofore unrecognized mental disorders, and to open the first asylum in brazil. 
 he has a huge madhouse, and many rooms to fill. 
 and fill it he shall, using the ""i don't know what it is, but i know it when i see it"" argument. 
 machado wrote this in 1881, and the field of psychotherapy still had a ways to go, and i swear this man had some robert johnson thing going on, because his prescience, in all of his works, is so keen. he feels so damn modern, it thrills me. 
 in his hands, this becomes darkly absurd, and for a tiny little work, there are several reversals and more plot than you would expect, more plot than many authors could have delivered. 
 to be clear,this book is not about capital-e evil, it is not about taking advantage of position and influence. it is about misguidedness, pure and simple. so it is a more nuanced work than one that is just ""this man is abusing his power."" when you think of machado's contemporaries like dickens or wilkie collins, and how polarized their good/evil characters are, machado's psychological insights are even more impressive. thomas hardy was probably the only person writing at the same time who wrote emotional and moral ambiguity as well as machado. 
 and you know how i feel about him. 
 definitely read machado. i plan on doing some re-reading of him this year myself, and reading some of the ones i have not yet gotten to.",124.0,1,4752,33216.48,6.99,498,4,4,3

 At least for this review.

 I just didn't connect with this book at any point, ever. I wanted to. I felt like I should have. I just didn't. I read it, never really cared, got to the end, shrugged, got off the couch, and made myself a sandwich.

 I read Helter Skelter in high school and that book was... way too long for a high school kid to read. I mean, it was a great read, fascinating, unbelievable, hard to even rationalize that it was a real event. Crazy.

Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls.

Like. Ever. 
 Not only has this seminal masterwork of fiction withstood a second read with flying colors, but it continues to define and defy both Science Fiction and Speculative Fiction categories. Heck, I think we can say it belongs on any Philosophy shelf, too, and I defy anyone to not laugh their heads off at the haircuts or Rakes or so many beautiful easter-eggs of ideas studded through the opening couple hundred pages. 
 What? It's just a bunch of monks talking philosophy and science in an alien world? How the heck could that be fun? 
 Ahh, this book moves on from that soon enough, especially when mysteries both small and really large start piling up, and the high-tech history of the world with it's truly awesome advances is only *part* of the reveals in store for us. 
 The world building is probably the most fantastic and excellent that I've ever read in any novel, and I'm even including masterworks like Dune and Foundation in this category. More than anything, it's the history and the alternate progressions of thought and development that is so close to our own history that is so amazing. And funny. Screw Occam's Razor. We've got a Rake. ;) 
 Little easter eggs abound in the opening that make so much more sense later in the novel, and on the second read, they're even better because we know what to expect. Causal Domain Shear? What's that? A haircut? OMG. 
 Do *not* expect this to remain a sleepy monk community that has remained cloistered with a few exceptions for 5 thousand years. 
 *Do* expect some truly wonderful and crazy science, philosophy, action and adventure, aliens, space-travel, time and space hacking, immortality, shaolin monks kicking all sorts of ass, horrible world killers, and multiple dimensions. 
 Holy crap, right? 
 It's a damn near perfect story, including great characters, pacing, reveals, science, politics, philosophy, and even religion and poetry. It also continues to blow my mind. How can something this complicated in its entirety read so easily, so effortlessly? But it does, and it's funny as hell, too. 
 I remember my first reading of this getting under my skin and confounding me at the same time. I kept wanting to categorize and pigeonhole it, and with every new hint that came along to tell me that I was going to fail miserably, I slowly got the hint that I just needed to go with the flow, trust the author, and just get fully immersed. There's no other way around it. 
 And there has never been a book quite like this in my life, ever before or ever since. 
 I can't even say that my love of this novel is a case of right place, right time, because with the second read almost eight years after the first, you'd think that I'd have grown as a person. I've certainly read a lot of new books, too. But, alas, this one still packs one hell of a punch. 
 The total-action scenes at the climax had me gasping for air, literally. I actually started crying from just how freaking awesome it all was. :)

The novel opens with an evocation of Woolf's last days before her suicide in 1941, and moves to the stories of two modern American women who are trying to make rewarding lives for themselves in spite of the demands of friends, lovers, and family.

After thirteen years of international bestseller stardom with his works of violent crime fiction, author George Stark is officially declared dead--revealed by a national magazine to have been killed at the hands of the man who created him: the once well-regarded but now obscure writer Thad Beaumont. Thad's even gone so far as to stage a mock burial of his wildly successful pseudonym, complete with tombstone and the epitaph ""Not a Very Nice Guy."" Although on the surface, it seems that Thad can finally concentrate on his own novels, there's a certain unease at the prospect of leaving George Stark behind. But that's nothing compared to the horror about to descend upon Thad's new life. There are the vicious, out-of-control nightmares, for starters. And how is he able to explain the fact that everyone connected to George Stark's untimely demise is now meeting a brutal end of their own in a pattern of homicidal savagery...and why each blood-soaked crime scene has Thad's fingerprints all over it? Thad Beaumont may have once believed that George Stark was running out of things to say, but he's going to find out just how wrong he is...

And she can hardly believe her luck. Running with celebs, gaining VIP access to Manhattan's hottest spots and meeting 'everyone worth knowing' is a million miles away from her old banking job. Overnight, New York has become her sexy late-night play...",Fiction,Novice,2,10,13,11.5,11,3.39,497,1.0,"One of the worst books I've ever read. Stereotypical characters, dull plot consisted of superficial world building, with predictive and anticlimactic ending. The dialogues are unrealistic and immature. And don't even let me start on describing this pathetic excuse for a ""love story"" or spectacular failure of a love triangle. Everything is horrible about this book. 
 Girl quits banking job, because she has been unhappy, gets a job at a PR firm, finds herself to be a star of the tabloids, whining along the way, gets a crush on the guy from a security of some posh club, kisses the guy from security, everything blows up all over their heads, then the girl realizes she hates the backstabbing PR business. 
 The side characters are even more flat and unimpressive than the main character. They have even less personality than Bette, our protagonist. Yes, I'm looking at you Penelope, you were 8 years involved with the guy who'd rather spend every goddamn night of the week drinking with some unimportant acquaintances than with you. Good guys are as superficial and obnoxious as the bad guys. Uncle Will is a shameless gay stereotype and basically has no other trait than being gay. Though the author broke her spine over convincing us how Bette, our protagonist, adjusted to the world of PR, it was obvious she had no idea what the hell she was doing nor how to deal with the complications. I don't even know how she handled the Playboy party when she had been totally incompetent with the task. I admit, I read it only so I could criticize it. 
 In the end, Bette is in the same place she was at the beginning of the book. She has no prospective job, nor she knows who she wants to be in the next five years. She is shallow, self-centered and lifeless main character, who is supposedly fascinating enough for photographers to take her photos everywhere she goes, and tabloids to write bullshit about. I just don't comprehend why this girl can't speak her mind about ANYTHING OR STAND UP FOR HERSELF. But the most ridiculous part of this book was the fact that she went along with every little plan her new boss had for her - from ""dating"" a guy who's blatantly gay and whom she can't stand, to ditching her best friends and family, so she could go the parties because ""it's part of the job"". Oh, give me a break. She had no character development whatsoever, and she willingly agreed to wait three fucking months for a guy who'd go and become successful in his career, while she sits at home in her PJs and eats junk food. She doesn't respect herself and I don't see why anyone else should. 
 For a chick-lit, the romance is almost non-existent and anticlimactic. The central love story is platonic, theatrical and unrealistic to that extent that I wanted to puke. After one kiss and two 5-minute conversations, which weren't that deep, they decided they have a future together, even though there was no situation or conversation in which we'd see if they share same interests or if they're compatible together.

1997,Beowulf,translated by Seamus Heaney,2000,2001,"The national bestseller and winner of the Whitbread Award. Composed toward the end of the first millennium, Beowulf is the classic Northern epic of a hero's triumphs as a young warrior and his fated death as a defender of his people. The poem is about encountering the monstrous, defeating it, and then having to live on, physically and psychically exposed in the exhausted aftermath. It is not hard to draw parallels in this story to the historical curve of consciousness in the twentieth century, but the poem also transcends such considerations, telling us psychological and spiritual truths that are permanent and liberating.
Beowulf is considered to have been composed between the 8th and the early 11th century. According to Wikipedia, it was first PUBLISHED in 1814 in a version by John Josias Conybeare.",Fiction,Novice,10,8,17,10.9,2,3.42,159931,4.0,"Beowulf is thought to have been written around the year 1000 AD, give or take a century. And the author is the extremely famous, very popular and world renowned writer... Unknown. Got you there, didn't I? LOL Probably not... if you're on Goodreads and studied American or English literature, you probably already knew this is one of the most famous works without an author. 
 It was first really published in the 1800s, using the Old English version where many have translated it, but there are still some blurry parts of the story. Essentially, a monster named Grendel hunts and kills the people of a town and many warriors have died fighting against it. Beowulf tackles the monster and its mother, and well... you're gonna have to read it to find out. Or if you can't get yourself there, watch the Star Trek or Simpsons episode which does a nice little rendition. 
 Here's the reasons why you should take a look at the story: 
 1. Many famous writers and editors have attempted to translate the story into more modern English. Tolkien is a famous example. Each reader has his/her own interpretation. So pick one whose style you like and go to that version. 
 2. It's a translated book... other than the famous Greek literature we read in high school, it's one of the earliest translated forms of literature. Makes it worth taking a gander. 
 3. It's a really great story. Monster terrorizes people. Someone strong steps up to fight it. There is a victory of sorts. Momma wants revenge. So... how many books have you read that have just copied... I mean borrowed... that entire plot? 
 4. There is a lot of beauty in the prose and the verse, and when you hear the words describe the creatures, it's a bit like fantasy. 
 Here's why you may not like it: 
 1. It's long. 
 2. It's hard to understand at some points. 
 3. It's 1000 years old and you just like modern stories. 
 My advice... pick a passage or two, read for 30 minutes and decide if it's something you want to read more of. But you should always give a chance to some part of our early heritage and culture. Right?

1999,The Day Of The Jackal,Frederick Forsyth,1971,2011,"Copy-editor: 
Seorang pria Inggris yang hanya dikenal dengan nama sandi: Jakal, disewa oleh organisasi pemberontak Prancis untuk membunuh Presiden Charles de Gaulle. Sebelumnya, upaya-upaya pembunuhan terhadap sang presiden selalu gagal. Informasi dan perencanaannya bocor ke tangan pemerintah lewat agen-agen yang disusupkan ke dalam organisasi rahasia tersebut.
Namun, kali ini serangan sang Jakal akan benar-benar rahasia dan mematikan!
Tidak ada satu pun arsip dan data yang dimiliki oleh pihak keamanan Prancis dan bahkan dinas rahasia di seluruh dunia terhadap pembunuh bayaran profesional top dunia ini. Tidak diketahui kapan, di mana, dan bagaimana sang Jakal akan beraksi. Perburuan pun dilakukan. Semua sumber daya keamanan dan informasi dikerahkan hanya untuk memburu satu orang yang tak bernama dan tak jelas pula ciri-ciri fisiknya. Namun yang pasti, nyawa sang presiden menjadi taruhannya dan Komisaris Claude Lebel, detektif terbaik Prancis, harus berpacu dengan waktu untuk meringkusnya.
Novel thriller terbaik di kelasnya ini telah mengilhami banyak peristiwa serupa di berbagai belahan dunia. Diceritakan dengan mendetail, seru, dan menegangkan, membuat Anda enggan meletakkannya sebelum membacanya sampai halaman terakhir.",Fiction,Excellent,36,1,8,2.9722222222222223,14,4.25,57,4.0,"Tentunya kita masih ingat sekitar dua tahun yang lalu Presiden SBY dalam sebuah konferensi pers mengatakan bahwa foto dirinya dijadikan sasaran tembak oleh para teroris yang sedang berlatih. Sebenarnya ini bukanlah hal yang aneh karena para pemimpin negara di berbagai belahan dunia ini seringkali menjadi target utama pembunuhan dari para lawan politiknya. 
 Presiden Soekarno sendiri selama masa pemerintahannya telah tujuh kali mengalami percobaan pembunuhan, begitu juga dengan pemimpin-pemimpin negara lainnya, rekor terbanyak hingga kini dipegang oleh pemimpin Cuba, Fidel Castro dengan 638 kali usaha percobaan pembunuhan terhadapnya. 
 Dari sekian banyak pemimpin dunia yang mendapat ancaman pembunuhan, Charles de Gaulle, (Presiden Perancis 1958-1969) adalah salah satu Presiden yang berkali-kali lolos dari upaya pembunuhan terhdap dirinya. Yang paling terkenal adalah yang terjadi pada tgl 22 Agustus 1962 dimana ia dan istrinya ditembak ketika sedang mengendarai mobil. Rencana pembunuhan ini dikomandoi oleh Kolonel Jean-Marie-Thiry, anggota militer Prancis sekaligus pemimpin OAS (Organisation L'armee Secrete), organisasi tentara rahasia yang berniat bertujuan menjatuhkan de Gaulle karena mereka berpendapat sang Presiden telah menghianati negaranya dengan memberi kemerdekaan kepada Aljazair yang semula merupakan tanah jajahan Prancis. 
 Rencana tersebut gagal, walau terdapat 14 lubang tembakan di mobilnya, Charles de Gaulle dan istrinya selamat dan Kolonel Thiry diganjar hukuman mati oleh pengadilan miltier Prancis pada tahun 1963. Persitiwa inilah yang kemudian mengilhami novelis Inggris Frederick Forsyth untuk menulis novel The Day of The Jackal (1971) 
 Dalam novelnya ini Forsyth mengawali kisahnya saat menjelang dilaksanakannya hukuman mati bagi Kolonel Jean-Marie-Thiry. Kemudian kisah bergerak mundur sejenak ke peristiwa percobaan pembunuhan de Gaulle yang dikomandoi oleh Kolonel Thiry. Paska percobaan pembunuhan yang gagal inilah yang oleh Forsyth dijadikan pijakan awal dalam mengembangkan imajinasinya. 
 Kematian Kolonel Thiry selaku pimpinan OAS tak membuat putus asa anggota-anggotanya. Belajar dari kegagalan-kegagalan sebelumnya, Kolonel Rodin, salah satu petinggi OAS membuat sebuah rencana rahasia untuk mencoba kembali membunuh Presiden de Gaulle melalui jasa seorang pembunuh profesional. Untuk mencegah bocornya rencana ini maka hanya tiga petinggi OAS dan sang pembunuh bayaran yang mengetahuinya. 
 Seluruh rencana pembunuhan diserahkan pada si pembunuh bayaran dari Inggris dengan nama sandi ""Jackal"". OAS hanya menyediakan bayaran yang diminta oleh si jackal yaitu 500 ribu dolar ( Rp. 4,5 Milyar), jumlah yang fantastis di tahun 60an. Setelah menerima uang muka dari OAS, mulailah sang Jackal melakukan berbagai persiapan mulai dari memesan senjata khusus dengan peluru berhulu ledak yang jika mengenai kepala akan menghancurkan segalanya di dalam tulang tengkorak, membuat 4 buah paspor palsu, hingga mempersiapkan perlengkapan penyamaran secara matang. 
 Berkat kejelian kepolisian Prancis, rencana pembunuhan terhadap Presiden de Gaulle kembali tercium, hanya saja kali ini mereka dibuat hampir mati kutu karena yang mereka ketahui hanyalah ciri-ciri fisik si pembunuh yaitu pria Inggris jangkung dengan rambut pirang, selain itu tak ada satu arsip dan data yang dimiliki pihak keamanan Prancis mengenai nama pembunuh, kapan, dimana, dan bagaimana si pembunuh professional ini akan beraksi. 
 Dengan nyawa Presiden sebagai taruhannya, pihak kepolisian Prancis yang dipimpin oleh Claude Lebel, detektif terbaik Prancis dan dibantu oleh kepolisian dari lima negara Eropa plus Amerika dan Afrika bertarung dengan waktu dan kecerdasan si Jackal dalam melaksanakannya tugas yang diembannya. 
 Kaya akan detail 
 Yang membuat novel ini menarik adalah bagaimana Forsyth menghadirkan detail-detail fakta dan peristiwanya. Hal ini bisa jadi keunggulan sekaligus kelemahan dimata pembacanya. Bagi yang menyukai kisah dengan plot cepat hal ini bisa jadi membosankan, terlebih jika pembaca tidak begitu menguasai materi yang dipaparkan si penulis. 
 Contohnya adalah soal senjata rakitan yang dipakai oleh si Jackal. Di sini penulis memaparkan secara detail mulai dari ukuran, jenis logam, alat picu, dsb yang tentunya membuat pembaca yang awam akan senjata jadi bosan, namun bagi mereka yang akrab dengan senjata mungkin hal ini merupakan bagian yang menarik. 
 Selain soal senjata, detail-detail soal pencurian paspor, pembuatan SIM Internasional dan paspor palsu, penyamaran si jackal, bagaimana ia mengelabui petugas keamanan dan imigrasi , cara kerja seorang detektif dalam merangkai data, dan sebagainya juga dibeberkan dalam novel ini. Selain itu penulis juga memaparkan latar belakang politik Prancis di masa pemerintahan Charles de Gaulle yang tentunya akan menambah wawasan pembacanya dalam hal situasi politik Prancis di tahun 60-an. 
 Kesemua itu diramu oleh Forsyth menjadi sebuah kisah triller yang menarik, walau di awal-awal agak terasa membosankan karena detail-detail diatas namun di bag-bab terakhir pembaca akan dibawa pada puncak ketegangan ketika Sang Presiden telah berada dalam bidikan senjata sang Jackal. 
 Di novel ini juga dikisahkan bagaimana Union Corse sebuah sindikat kejahatan yang terorganisir di Prancis yang lebih tua dan berbahaya daripada Mafia Sisilia turut membantu kepolisian Prancis untuk memburu sang Jackal. Sayangnya Forsyth kurang mengeksplorasi keterlibatan Union Corse, kalau saja peran organisasi rahasia ini diberi porsi yang lebih besar novel ini pasti akan lebih menarik lagi. 
 Novel yang berbahaya 
 Saking detailnya penulis memberikan gambaran bagaima sang Jackal mempersiapkan dirinya untuk melaksanakan perkerjaan profersionalnya, buku ini ternyata memberikan dampak yang mungkin tidak terduga oleh Forsyth sebelumnya. 
 Metode untuk mendapatkan paspor palsu yang secara diteil dijelaskan dalam buku ini berhasil ditiru oleh banyak orang. Metode yang akhirnya dikenal dengan istilah ""Day of the Jackal Fraud"" ini kemudian dianggap sebagai celah keamanan paling rentan di Inggris sehingga pemerintah Inggris akhirnya melakukan perubahan besar-besaran dalam birokrasi pengurusan dokumen. 
 Usaha sang Jackal untuk membunuh presiden Prancis juga mengilhami Yigal Amir, seorang militan ekstrem kanan untuk membunuh PM Israel Yithzak Rabin pada 1955. Vladimir Arutnunian yang pada tahun 2005 berencana membunuh Presiden AS George W. Bush mengaku terobsesi untuk melakukan apa yang dilakukan oleh Jackal. 
 Dari fakta-fakta diatas rasanya tak berlebihan kalau novel ini saya anggap sebagai novel yang memikat sekaligus berbahaya! 
 Sejarah Penerbitan dan Adaptasi film 
 The Day of The Jackal karya Frederick Forsyth ini pertama kali diterbitkan di Inggris pada 1971 oleh penerbit Huthcinson dan langsung menjadi best seller. Di tahun 1972 novel ini meraih penghargaan novel terbaik Edgar Allan Poe.

 Di Indonesia sendiri novel ini setidaknya telah 2 kali diterjemahkan, di tahun 1977 The Day of The Jackal l pernah diterbitkan oleh Gramedia setelah sebelumnya muncul sebagai sebagai cerita bersambung di Koran KOMPAS. Pada thun 2004 novel ini juga diterbitkan dalam dua jilid oleh penerbit Alice Saputra Comunication dengan judul Beraksinya Sang Jakal 
 Sedangkan untuk adaptasi film, novel ini pertama kali diadaptasi ke layar lebar oleh Universal Picture pada tahun 1973 dengan Edward Fox sebagai sang Jackal. Kabarnya plot filmnya ini sangat setia pada bukunya, sesuatu yang sangat jarang terjadi pada film-film yang diadaptasi dari sebuah novel. 
 Pada tahun 1997 film ini dibuat remake-nya dengan perubahan plot dan kondisi era tahun 90an dengan Bruce Willis sebagai sang Jackal didampingi Richard Gere dan Sidney Poiter.

Veteran CIA operative Steve Conway knows the next target -- a combat uniform that renders a soldier virtually invisible -- and knows it would make Angel Eyes unstoppable. But when a trap is set, things go terribly wrong. Now, to retrieve the most valuable weapon ever invented, Conway must go one-on-one with the most dangerous man in the world.

Charlie is offered a chance to clear his tab: simply stay alone on a ship overnight to prove to its owner and potential crew that it's not cursed nor haunted. Never mind the ship's history of suicide, violence, mutiny and murder. Or how the ship's past crews have gone missing or insane.

For most of the book, the horror was strictly atmospheric. 
 Things really took off around the 70% mark and the book was impossible to put down after that. Lots of revolting things happened and I almost gagged a few times. By the end, Tim Curran's talent was affirmed once again. And the last line was one last kick to the groin.

2010,The Underground Railroad,Colson Whitehead,2016,2016,"Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. Life is hellish for all the slaves but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood - where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned and, though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.
In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor - engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven - but the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. Even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.
As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroadis at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.",Fiction,Excellent,37,1,16,7.432432432432432,11,4.03,86839,4.0,"By my count, three black science fiction writers have been recognized with MacArthur ""genius grants."" Everyone agrees on the first: Octavia Butler, taken too soon. Everyone knows the second: Ta-Nehisi Coates, who's in on what I'm sure some will argue is a technicality for writing a dozen issues of BLACK PANTHER. (And let me just observe here that it's more than a technicality -- yes, the vibranium and the resurrection tanks and whatnot barely get you in the door, but what makes Coates and BLACK PANTHER the real deal is his wrestling with the idea of Wakanda. On the one hand, he's perhaps more seduced than anyone by the idea of an African city that's more than self-sufficient, that's in fact economically and technologically dominant on the world stage; on the other, he knows better than anyone the sort of violence nation-states are built on, and the sorrow with which he goes about scarring and complicating the Wakandan Dream just about screams from every panel -- 
 -- OK, stopping now while I can still save this. Not even closing the parenthesis. The third is Colson Whitehead, on the strength at least but perhaps not exclusively of THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. 
 The most famous bit of speculation is, of course the railroad itself, the network of protectors and spiriters-away literalized into physical tunnels, rails, and trains. Their origin is mysterious, but their operations are as concrete as you could want: Timetables are notional at best, stations and their agents are periodically discovered and destroyed, stops are canceled and routed around -- and, most importantly, they are not announced. When the train comes, you take it wherever it's going. 
 These caprices of operation are what bring our heroine, Cora, through a series of Whitehead's subtler speculations: Each state of the South is its own miniature, highlighting some vexation of black existence in the antebellum South (and, ultimately, North as well). There is the South Carolina in which gentleness toward slaves masks a covert medical operation that makes Tuskegee look like a Twitter poll; the North Carolina in which white rage has overcome white greed, and the penalty for being black in the state's borders is death; the Tennessee ravaged by fire and plague, consumed by the fear of its majority population finding the will to rise up; the Indiana in which former slaves might, perhaps, find a place to rest and belong in freedom. It presumably goes without saying that the century and change between Appomattox and Trump have sapped precious little relevance from these vignettes. 
 Vignettes they are, though, and it's fair enough to say that there's not necessarily a strong emotional core or narrative arc to the book; Cora is more or less windswept, her trajectory from scene to scene a function of the world's actions, not her own. But there's value, to say nothing of beauty, in a well-crafted series of vignettes; and it feels piggy to ask more from Cora, who has been so hard put simply to endure what's come to her, and whom we appreciate, in the last analysis, for her ability to look power in the eye and decline to shuck and jive. 
 It's fair, too, to observe that the Underground Railroad is depersonalized, a network of relationships and people crystallized into metal and stone. Thinking about it this way, though, the shibboleth about the railroad's creation takes on a few new layers of meaning. When Cora (or anyone) asks who built the Underground Railroad, the response is ""Who builds anything in this country?"" It's a glib rejoinder, almost a put-down, at first blush. But it has the curious effect of bringing all of black America in on the conspiracy to secure its own freedom; and, from the evanescent ties of care and fellow-traveling that formed the original Railroad, to create a monument to freedom that would long outlast its use, that would wink quietly from the trapdoors of cellars and cisterns and remind us what had been done, and why, and at what cost.",1.0,0,108,538.9200000000001,4.99,1195,1,4,4

Lara and Sadie make a hilarious sparring duo, and at first it seems as though they have nothing in common.

 Although there was a good romance in this book, it wasn't the main focus of the book. Instead, this novel put most of it's emphasis on family and friendship and I really liked that! Sadie definitely got on my nerves a lot, mostly because I was listening to this as an audio book and the narrator made her voice especially annoying while saying her lines. However, she had a surprising amount of character development keeping in mind that she was the GHOST of a 105 year old woman. I really enjoyed how this was a mystery as well, there was so much going on that you almost forgot about one part of the story when it showed up again!

 This time paeodophiles are being brutally murdered and no obvious reasoning is forthcoming. Kerrigan and the team are put onto the case and soon enough the bodies start piling up. About halfway through the book the storyline takes on a different turn sending the whole thing into a different direction. It was cleverly done and not an obvious route to follow. I enjoyed the book for the most part but did think some parts of the book were stretched out a little. Too much detail at times that wasn't really necessary and I would actually prefer shorter chapters to keep the flow and momentum going. Occasionally I would wonder into 'when is this chapter finishing?' territory as chapters would sometimes drag on. The second half of the book really picks up pace and this is where it really held my attention and I didn't want to put the book down until the end. 
 Maeve Kerrigan herself is a likeable character albeit her decisions at times leaves the head shaking. She isn't perfect my any means, quick tempered and could do with thinking before acting rationally but she has a flair for the job and is growing on me as her character develops through the books.

2015,The Birth Of Venus,Sarah Dunant,2004,2003,"Sarah Dunant's gorgeous and mesmerizing novel, Birth of Venus, draws readers into a turbulent 15th-century Florence, a time when the lavish city, steeped in years of Medici family luxury, is suddenly besieged by plague, threat of invasion, and the righteous wrath of a fundamentalist monk. Dunant masterfully blends fact and fiction, seamlessly interweaving Florentine history with the coming-of-age story of a spirited 14-year-old girl. As Florence struggles in Savonarola's grip, a serial killer stalks the streets, the French invaders creep closer, and young Alessandra Cecchi must surrender her ""childish"" dreams and navigate her way into womanhood. Readers are quickly seduced by the simplicity of her unconventional passions that are more artistic than domestic: 
Dancing is one of the many things I should be good at that I am not. Unlike my sister. Plautilla can move across the floor like water and sing a stave of music like a song bird, while I, who can translate both Latin and Greek faster than she or my brothers can read it, have club feet on the dance floor and a voice like a crow. Though I swear if I were to paint the scale I could do it in a flash: shining gold leaf for the top notes falling through ochres and reds into hot purple and deepest blue.Alessandra's story, though central, is only one part of this multi-faceted and complex historical novel. Dunant paints a fascinating array of women onto her dark canvas, each representing the various fates of early Renaissance women: Alessandra's lovely (if simple) sister Plautilla is interested only in marrying rich and presiding over a household; the brave Erila, Alessandra's North African servant (and willing accomplice) has such a frank understanding of the limitations of her sex that she often escapes them; and Signora Cecchi, Alessandra's beautiful but weary mother tries to encourage yet temper the passions of her wayward daughter. A luminous and lush novel, The Birth of Venus, at its heart, is a mysterious and sensual story with razor-sharp teeth. Like Alessandra, Dunant has a painter's eye--her writing is rich and evocative, luxuriating in colors and textures of the city, the people, and the art of 15th-century Florence. Reminiscent of Tracy Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring, but with sensual splashes of color and the occasional thrill of fear, Dunant's novel is both exciting and enchanting.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,9,15,11.666666666666666,6,3.79,132,5.0,A story that grabs your attention in the last paragraph of the first chapter (maybe it was the prologue).

The Langoliers
Secret Window, Secret Garden
The Library Policeman
The Sun Dog",Nonfiction,Intermediate,22,1,13,3.3181818181818183,12,3.9,77840,4.0,"A re-read after more than twenty years. Will it stand up? 
 Short answer: Absolutely. :) 
 The Langoliers fits snugly in the New Weird category, pretty much entirely esoteric SF with gremlin-types, alternate dimenions and/or time travel on a plane... There are no snakes here! :) The characters are a blast and we've got a firm horror vibe going on here where we are kept guessing as to who among all these random sleepers will make it to the end. Thoroughly enjoyable novella, but not my favorite. It's probably best that it was relegated to a TV movie. :) 
 My favorite is a toss up between Secret Window, Secret Garden, and The Library Police. 
 First, though, Secret Window, Secret Garden, which only slightly resembles the movie with Johnny Depp, or at least more or less. :) 
 This one was pretty fantastic for the writing insights, the plagiarism scare, the descent into paranoia, and the general ultimate break from reality. What's better than a writer being driven completely crazy by a story and/or a man with a definite grudge over a story? No spoilers, but so many wonderful twists happen, couldn't help but fall in love all over again. 
 And then there's The Library Police, which is a wonderful twist on early childhood nightmares, a diatribe on fear, Red Licorice, and a cool twist on vampirism. It was definitely probably the most effective and convoluted of all the novellas in this book, I think, and also the most scarily fantastic, diving into some of the most weird and eerie escapades, even outdoing Secret Window, Secret Garden on several levels, but maybe not as much for the MC. 
 The last novella, The Sun Dog, is classic SK not only for setting dropping and character dropping, but also in the twist he's known for... turning everyday objects into a nightmare of continuing and evolving proportions, driving all those involved into a deeper and deeper despair and fear. :) 
 Does SK have a think about mad dogs? Even Cujo was referenced here. But the dog in the photograph has got to be even better in this novella. It's absolutely more elusive and menacing, giving up on immediate danger and far-off menace for a much more paranormal and evil menace that gave me, at least, a more pervasive and ongoing fear. 
 It also happened to be my least favorite of the bunch, but it was still effective. :) 
 The middle two were plainly amazing, though. :)",74.0,1,37368,201039.84,5.38,779,5,5,4

2019,Dreamcatcher,Stephen King,2001,2002,"What might be done to human beings by the ""Other""--whether the ""Other"" be vampires, demons or creatures from outer space--is always in competition for absolute horror with what we do to ourselves. Stephen King has, in his time, played with both sources of the nightmarish and in Dreamcatcher, the first complete novel since his near-fatal accident, he gives us both.
Four childhood friends, united by secrets, are caught in the quarantine zone when something crashes into the remote forests of Maine; and the question becomes who will avoid being eaten alive by alien fungi, torn from the inside by alien ferrets, possessed by alien minds or menaced by a psychotic military commander to whom ruthlessness has become a macho ego trip?
The Earth is in peril as well, needless to say, but most of our attention is taken up with a few men caught on the edge, and where the most important thing in the world turns out to be the fact that four small boys saved a fifth from a beating.
This has the hall-marks of a good King novel--memorable catchphrases whose meaning we only gradually learn and a sense of how it feels to be human. --Roz Kaveney",Fiction,Intermediate,15,1,15,5.2,10,3.59,522,3.0,"As I was going up the stair 
 I meet a man who wasn't there; 
 He wasn't there again today! 
 I wish, I wish he'd stay away. 
 Well, what a ride that was... 
 Rating this book was quite hard. I'm still not sure if I'm okay with giving it 3 stars, because it had so many good characters, parts and plot twists, so one part of me feels like giving it 5 stars. But then again, at some parts, it left me feeling miserable and asking myself if I was ever going to finish it, so because of that, the other part of me think that it deserves only 2 stars. So I guess I'll just have to settle and give it 3 (3.3) stars. But still, I don't think I've ever wished that Goodreads had a half-star system, as much as I do now. 
 Dreamcatcher is a book about alien invasion, but it's unlike any other alien invasion book. Also, it is unlike any other Stephen King's book that I've read. The book started out great. I actually loved the first half. I loved getting to know our main characters, I loved the plot, and I loved how King introduced aliens. There were even some scenes that creeped me out, and at some parts I even had to stop reading for a few seconds. But then, somewhere in the middle, something happened, and the book unfortunately got worse. It started dragging on and at some parts it became flat out boring. Then, maybe 50 pages before the end, the pace picked up again, and it got back to being amazing. I absolutely loved the way it ended, and how everything came together. 
 When it comes to characters, just like in any other King's work, they were my favorite part of this book (well, at least some of them were). I loved our main four characters (Henry and Jonesy especially). I also loved Duddits, and even Owen. But, on the other hand, there is Kurtz - a character I absolutely despised. And he is the main reason why I had problems with this book. I think that his character was completely unnecessary. I loved reading from everyone's point of view except from his. And the irony was that his chapters got bigger and bigger as the book went on. In my opinion, he brought nothing to the story, and was only there to make it longer. If his character was removed from the story I don't think that anything important in the plot would change. 
 In the end, even though this book made me question my sanity a few times, I'm still glad that I've read it. Even though it had some bad parts, it also had so many more amazing parts.",54.0,1,316,1576.84,4.99,310,1,5,2

If Gordon, the rookie who really is in his teens, can't cut ties with his old life and accept his new limitations, Cole will have to discreetly dispose of the kid--the same way a mad dog would be put down for the safety of society.
Cole thinks he can handle it.

One kid gets in the car, the others stay put, and their lives will never be the same. Decades later, Dave Boyle, the kid who got into the car, is accused of killing the daughter of Jimmy Marcus, one of the other boys, and the third boy has grown up to be Sean Devine, the cop in charge of the case. Did Boyle do it? And if he didn't, can Sean find the real killer? 
 Yeah, 2013 was supposed to be the year of Dennis Lehane for me. It probably would have been had I not discovered George Pelecanos. However, I'm back aboard the Lehane Train now and quite pleased. 
 While Mystic River is normally classified as a thriller, it's so much more than that, an exploration of growing up and what a traumatic childhood event can blossom into. Mystic River is the tale of three Boston boys who grew up to be very different Boston men. Dave Boyle has drifted from job to job, never quite managing to bury his abduction experience. Jimmy Marcus is a former career criminal who has gone straight and become a family man. And Sean Devine is a cop with a wife he hasn't seen in over a year and a child he's not sure is his. 
 From the beginning, Lehane kept the waters sufficiently muddy to hold my interest. While I knew I was supposed to assume Dave Boyle killed Katie Marcus, Lehane had me changing my opinion quite a few times. None of the three leads are very simple characters. Dave's got his childhood baggage but still tries to be the best husband and father he can be. Jimmy was once a criminal and is still a hard man but is a loving family man. Sean is a supercop but his marriage is in ruins and he's coming off a suspension for something very petty. 
 Once Sean is on the case, the book becomes very hard to put down, like it's been duct-taped to your hands. The mystery, unlike a lot of them these days, is solvable and I guessed who the killer was about 75% of the way through, even though I got the motive wrong. 
 The writing is everything I came to expect from the Kenzie and Gennaro series and then some. I think this is the book where Dennis Lehane went from ""Good Thriller Writer"" to simply ""Great Writer.""

But when a band of fierce, painted warriors captured her en route, she fearlessly met their demand to marry their leader -- the quick-tempered laird Connor MacAlister. She couldn't know that her capture was merely the first act of vengeance against her betrothed, Connor's sworn enemy.
Brenna harbored no illusions that her husband was in love with her; after a hasty forest wedding, MacAlister assured her she could return home once she had borne him a son. But she could not deny that she had once proposed to MacAlister -- ten years ago, when she was just a child, and the visitor to her father's castle charmed her with his dazzling, unexpected smile.

This just felt like a mashup of a lot of classic dystopian novels rolled up into one, but it never really got close to the level of any of the books it was trying to be. A little bit of The Giver with some Fahrenheit 451 maybe some 1984 and then some elements of any other dystopian novel. This just never took off for me for some reason. 
 I was definitely drawn to the idea of the book and the world it described. The thought of a world controlled by language and what words must be used was interesting, but it played out more ridiculous on the book. I think the concept is good, just not enough there to make me care. Even at the beginning when the first bit of intrigue occurs and Marlo shows up unexpectedly and you're trying to figure out who he is and all that... I was just bored. 
 Hey, and it was cool how things sort of mirror our own world. The story of Noah's Ark is there, I mean with the same name and all, and there is this rebuilding and starting a new world after crazy events. That was cool. Like I said, there was some good stuff here that just needed someone to come along and breathe more life into it. I would go through an entire chapter sometimes and find my mind wandering off, and then I would snap back into it and realize I hadn't missed much. 
 So if dystopian is your thing, gives this a shot later this year. I've found plenty of great reviews out there. I just love the books it draws inspiration from, but felt this one didn't come anywhere close to being what it could have been. Oh, and the fact that you only get 500 words to use is a cool idea, but whew boy is it hard to read. It just got kind of silly. That's all.

Practically overnight the stock market has plummeted, hyperinflation has crippled commerce, and the fragile chains of supply and high-technology infrastructure have fallen. The power grids are down. Brutal rioting and looting grip every major city. The volatile era known as ""the Crunch"" has begun, and this new period in our history will leave no one untouched. In this unfamiliar environment, only a handful of individuals are equipped to survive.
Andrew Laine, a resourceful young U.S. Army officer stationed overseas in Afghanistan, wants nothing more than to return home to Bloomfield, New Mexico. With the world in turmoil and all air and sea traffic to America suspended, Laine must rely on his own ingenuity and the help of good Samaritans to reach his family.

And now the police are watching them...",Fiction,Intermediate,7,1,15,5.857142857142857,14,3.57,332,5.0,"This is a wonderfully dark and twisted psychological thriller by Simon Lelic. It shifts and runs into unexpected places, different from the blurb given about the book. Jack has uncomfortable feelings about a London house that his girlfriend, Syd Baker, thinks is perfect for them. To their surprise, given they tendered a lower offer, the owner chooses them. When something is too good to be true, they should have been more wary, but they move in without a second thought. The previous owner has left behind all his belongings, which the happy couple begin to sort through. However, there are strange sounds, and gruesome discoveries in the attic. There is a child's treasure box with a familiar name on it. The story begins with the police watching the house, with Jack and Syd writing down their experiences of living there, with the occasional contentious perception. This is a novel about the past haunting the present with its firm and tenacious grip. 
 The narrative is delivered through our couple, Jack and Syd, documenting how their lives begin to spiral out of their control. Jack is a housing officer who goes out of his way to help his desperate clients. He is not close with his middle class parents who disapprove of Syd. Syd's past contains trauma and drug taking, making her a more volatile character, but she is committed to Jack, hoping for a more settled future with him. Syd's mother visits and recognises a picture on their wall. Syd finds herself becoming close to Elsie Payne, a young girl that lives locally. We learn of the details of the historical past of Syd and Jack, and how it connects to their dire present situation. This is a story that covers the issues of dysfunctional families, fathers, trust, loss and the search for justice, by whatever means possible. 
 Lelic has a gripping writing style that just grabs the reader right from the beginning. His plotting is remarkably well handled, and the narrative is so compelling, tense and suspenseful, driven by the well executed twists. I find psychological thrillers a hit or miss affair, this is a hit in every sense, I can see this being a bestseller, and deservedly so. What is really outstanding is the characters of Jack and Syd, they are superbly developed, particularly Syd. A morally ambiguous and brilliant read that I highly recommend!

 SWEDISH REVIEW 
 Om det ar nagot Mo Hayder kan sa ar det att skriva bocker som gar under skinnet pa en. Precis som Dennis Lehane sa vagar hon ta ut svangarna och det ar med isande fasa man laser varje sida. 
 Forsvunnen ar inget undantag. Att lasa om kidnappade barn ar hemskt och man vet inte om Jack Caffery kommer att lyckas radda situationen. Caffery ar en lysande polis, men i denna bok sa verkar det som om kidnapparen kan forutse polisen nasta drag och ju mer tiden gar desto mer lutar det at att det ar forsent, att flickan inte kommer att raddas. 
 Sedan har vi polisdykaren Flea Marley, som lever med konsekvenserna fran foregaende bok, vilket stor henne i jobbet. Hon vet inte om att Jack misstanker henne for ett brott som hon faktiskt ar oskyldig till men som i och med det Jack vet om det ter sig logiskt att han misstanker henne. Nu ger hon sig in kampen for att radda den kidnappade flickan. Men ar hon verkligen i form att ta sig an fallet? Kommer hon istallet bara att riskera sitt eget liv? 
 Forsvunnen ar en ruggig thriller dar den okande forovaren hela tiden lurar i bakgrunden och man sitter pa helspand pa slutet nar Caffery konfronterar forovaren. Fragan ar kommer allting att sluta lyckligt?

 ENGLISH REVIEW 
 If there is one thing Mo Hayder knows is it to write a book that crawls under your skin. She dares, just like Dennis Lehane can she write in such a way that it's with terror you turn each page. 
 Gone is no exception. Reading about kidnapped children is always terrible and you do not know if Jack Caffery will be able to save the kidnapped girl. Caffery is a brilliant police, but in this book, the kidnapper seems to anticipate every single move the police do, and as more time goes by, the fear grows that they will be too late. 
 Then we have police diver Flea Marley, who lives with the consequences from the previous book, which has consequences for her at work. She does not know that Jack suspects her for a crime she's actually innocent of. Although it's quite logical that he suspects her since he doesn't have the whole picture. Now she decides to search for the kidnapped girl. But, is she really in shape to help out? Or will she only risk her own life? 
 Gone is a tough thriller where the unidentified perpetrator always lurks in the background, and at the end, when Caffery confronts the perpetrator will you still question if everything will end happily...

 I'm gonna be a little spoilery. :) 
 Why? The re-read was actually rather satisfying. Yes, it's a novel about survival and all the kinds of crap that men make women do to satisfy themselves, but it's also a rather moving novel about keeping (or losing) one's sanity in the face of all those expectations. 
 Never mind the sheer horror of being handcuffed to a bed without hope of being saved because your lover just keeled over, or watching a dog eat your husband as you go thirsty. It's a lot more than just that. It's memories and other humiliations and the struggle to find oneself through one hell of an ordeal. 
 Plus, I kinda like the fact that we're dealing with a very Poe-ish or Aristotelian art-ethic here. It's very focused in time and place, forcing us to go down deep into the subconscious. I can't help but appreciate that more now than when I was younger. *shrug* 
 Either way, I also enjoyed the almost tacked-on feel of the extended denouement. It really gave a sense of reflection and of shoring up her defenses after having them all stripped away, both literally and figuratively. I felt the power of the positive reversal. 
 Now, I should say that I'm revising this from my three stars to four based mainly on the fact that the novel is good on its own, but when I chose to give it three (from memory), I did so based on my enjoyment in comparison with the rest of Stephen King's works. It isn't his strongest novel by far, but it was still quite enjoyable.

Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls. Three times during history's darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe, becoming out of necessity even more austere and less dependent on technology and material things. And Erasmas has no fear of the outside--the Extramuros--for the last of the terrible times was long, long ago.
Now, in celebration of the week-long, once-in-a-decade rite of Apert, the fraas and suurs prepare to venture beyond the concent's gates--at the same time opening them wide to welcome the curious ""extras"" in. During his first Apert as a fraa, Erasmas eagerly anticipates reconnecting with the landmarks and family he hasn't seen since he was ""collected."" But before the week is out, both the existence he abandoned and the one he embraced will stand poised on the brink of cataclysmic change.
Powerful unforeseen forces jeopardize the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros--a threat that only an unsteady alliance of saecular and avout can oppose--as, one by one, Erasmas and his colleagues, teachers, and friends are summoned forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster.

No wonder the book finds mention in both the top 100 mystery/crime novel lists published by the Britain-based Crime Writers' Association and by the Mystery Writers of America. Both the lists were published in the nineties and feature some of the finest specimens of crime writing. The lists can be found here - Link 
 The story is narrated by Rozat K. Sabich aka Rusty, chief deputy prosecutor of Kindle county who is also the protagonist. The story begins with the murder of Carolyn, another prosecuting attorney, with whom Rusty had an affair and never got over his obsession of her. Rusty gets the responsibility of investigating the crime but himself ends up getting accused of the murder and faces trial. 
 The book features some really great court room scenes, complex characters and portrays so many human emotions and frailties. Illicit passion, betrayal, corruption, dirty politics, jealousy, friendship, paternal feelings, family bonds - everything finds a place in the story. The author has also explained quite a few legal technicalities which makes it easier for the reader to understand some of the complexities of the trial. The mystery is excellent and the very few would be able to guess the identity of the culprit. 
 Rusty, accustomed to putting criminals behind bars, is now the accused and feels how is it to be on the other side. He talks about his obsession with Carolyn, his childhood, his strained relationship with his wife, his fear of missing out his son's childhood if he is sent to prison. Some of his ramblings is actually a bit boring and do not fit in the story.The author's use of the English language is impressive but somehow I felt at times it was not compatible with the character or the story. e.g. a person, who is a prosecutor not a poet, facing a murder charge is unlikely to use phrases like ""doors and windows of my soul are thrown open to a fundamental gratitude"". It is my only criticism of the novel. 
 The book is not just a thriller but Scott Turow's attempt to explore the intricacies of the human mind and he has done a commendable job. I would recommend the book to lovers of legal thrillers, murder mysteries, psychological thrillers if he/she does not mind the ramblings of the protagonist.",52.0,1,4995,14935.05,2.99,479,4,5,4

 SWEDISH REVIEW 
 Om det ar nagot Mo Hayder kan sa ar det att skriva bocker som gar under skinnet pa en. Precis som Dennis Lehane sa vagar hon ta ut svangarna och det ar med isande fasa man laser varje sida. 
 Forsvunnen ar inget undantag. Att lasa om kidnappade barn ar hemskt och man vet inte om Jack Caffery kommer att lyckas radda situationen. Caffery ar en lysande polis, men i denna bok sa verkar det som om kidnapparen kan forutse polisen nasta drag och ju mer tiden gar desto mer lutar det at att det ar forsent, att flickan inte kommer att raddas. 
 Sedan har vi polisdykaren Flea Marley, som lever med konsekvenserna fran foregaende bok, vilket stor henne i jobbet. Hon vet inte om att Jack misstanker henne for ett brott som hon faktiskt ar oskyldig till men som i och med det Jack vet om det ter sig logiskt att han misstanker henne. Nu ger hon sig in kampen for att radda den kidnappade flickan. Men ar hon verkligen i form att ta sig an fallet? Kommer hon istallet bara att riskera sitt eget liv? 
 Forsvunnen ar en ruggig thriller dar den okande forovaren hela tiden lurar i bakgrunden och man sitter pa helspand pa slutet nar Caffery konfronterar forovaren. Fragan ar kommer allting att sluta lyckligt?

 ENGLISH REVIEW 
 If there is one thing Mo Hayder knows is it to write a book that crawls under your skin. She dares, just like Dennis Lehane can she write in such a way that it's with terror you turn each page. 
 Gone is no exception. Reading about kidnapped children is always terrible and you do not know if Jack Caffery will be able to save the kidnapped girl. Caffery is a brilliant police, but in this book, the kidnapper seems to anticipate every single move the police do, and as more time goes by, the fear grows that they will be too late. 
 Then we have police diver Flea Marley, who lives with the consequences from the previous book, which has consequences for her at work. She does not know that Jack suspects her for a crime she's actually innocent of. Although it's quite logical that he suspects her since he doesn't have the whole picture. Now she decides to search for the kidnapped girl. But, is she really in shape to help out? Or will she only risk her own life? 
 Gone is a tough thriller where the unidentified perpetrator always lurks in the background, and at the end, when Caffery confronts the perpetrator will you still question if everything will end happily...

On his deathbed, their father extracts a promise: Anya will tell her daughters a story; it is one she began years ago and never finished. This time she will tell it all the way to the end.

Quentin Coldwater is brilliant but miserable. A senior in high school, he's still secretly preoccupied with a series of fantasy novels he read as a child, set in a magical land called Fillory. Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery.
He also discovers all the other things people learn in college: friendship, love, sex, booze, and boredom. Something is missing, though. Magic doesn't bring Quentin the happiness and adventure he dreamed it would. After graduation he and his friends make a stunning discovery: Fillory is real. But the land of Quentin's fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he could have imagined. His childhood dream becomes a nightmare with a shocking truth at its heart.
At once psychologically piercing and magnificently absorbing, The Magicians boldly moves into uncharted literary territory, imagining magic as practiced by real people, with their capricious desires and volatile emotions. Lev Grossman creates an utterly original world in which good and evil aren't black and white, love and sex aren't simple or innocent, and power comes at a terrible price.",Fiction,Novice,1,9,9,9.0,13,3.48,93,2.0,"DNF at 78%. I got to a point where I did not care anymore. I spent way too much time with all of the characters (not just Quentin) to be able to stomach anymore of their bullshit.

Does the presence of magic make the characters any more likable? Not even a little. I can't fault the main character for being unlikable - Lev Grossman did an incredible job of writing realistic characters. I didn't hate Quentin because he was an asshole. I hated him (and everyone else) because the book was simply too god damn long and I wanted to murder all of them when I revisited this book.

Luminous, haunting, unforgettable, The Age of Miraclesis a stunning fiction debut by a superb new writer, a story about coming of age during extraordinary times, about people going on with their lives in an era of profound uncertainty.
On a seemingly ordinary Saturday in a California suburb, 11-year-old Julia and her family awake to discover, along with the rest of the world, that the rotation of the earth has suddenly begun to slow. The days and nights grow longer and longer, gravity is affected, the environment is thrown into disarray. Yet as she struggles to navigate an ever-shifting landscape, Julia is also coping with the normal disasters of everyday life--the fissures in her parents' marriage, the loss of old friends, the hopeful anguish of first love, the bizarre behavior of her grandfather who, convinced of a government conspiracy, spends his days obsessively cataloging his possessions. As Julia adjusts to the new normal, the slowing inexorably continues.
With spare, graceful prose and the emotional wisdom of a born storyteller, Karen Thompson Walker has created a singular narrator in Julia, a resilient and insightful young girl, and a moving portrait of family life set against the backdrop of an utterly altered world.",Fiction,Intermediate,2,6,10,8.0,1,3.64,61891,5.0,"I loved this book. I read it in one 24 hour period. Great example of soft sci-fi/fabulist fiction. It's like a cross between Alice Sebold's book The Lovely Bones and Lars Van Trier's film Melancholia. In some ways, I also thought about Diary of Anne Frank. A young girl faces a possible apocalypse in MIRACLES. It's YA dystopia but more charming and whimsical than, say, The Hunger Games. Ultimately it is a book that celebrates life with one hand, as it erases life with the other. 
 The language of the book is poetic and intoxicating. The consequences of the slowing earth are imagined in rich and provocative detail. 
 SPOILER ALERT. 
 I did think the author cheated just a bit here and there. It's a brilliant cheat. There are times the hero Julia says things like: ""That was the last time I EVER ate strawberries."" Or I NEVER saw so and so again. That kind of language hints that she might die at the end, or that the world ends in the last chapter. In fact, the character and the world still go on by the novel's end, albeit precariously. I think the more honest phrasing would have been: ""That was the last time I ate strawberries this spring."" Because as long as the earth spins and she is alive, she can't truly know that she will NEVER eat strawberries again. Even if strawberries become extinct, technically she can not know that by some twist of fate she won't eat them again. 
 It's a small thing and I think the author was very clever to use this sleight of hand. It made me think that the girl or the world were going away. It's a book I will think of for some time. As a writer myself of speculative, trippy fiction -- I am in the process of analyzing the many things this book did right!

 Chris Van Allsburg's The Polar Express is a children's classic. This story about a little boy who boards a train to the North Pole and gets the first Christmas gift of the year is a timeless reminder of the joys of Christmas and why it's great for kids to believe. 
 This book is a classic. I can remember reading this as a kid, and more recently seeing the movie. I wasn't a huge fan of this book like other kids were, I enjoyed it but it wasn't a favourite. Reading it again now I can really enjoy the art, which I didn't even pay attention to as a kid. The art and the story of this book are pretty fantastic. I did find the story a little dull and rushed at times which is why it doesn't get a perfect score. 
 The art of this book is really the high point. The illustrations are beautiful and really capture the magic of Christmas. The really iconic and classic image of this book is the final page, the bell, which is really a striking image and one I've always remembered. 
 The story itself is really beautiful. I always felt that it was important for kids to believe is Christmas, it inspires so much imagination. I think this story is a huge reminder of that. I do think it's a bit rushed, it is a really short book, but it's understandable given that it is a picture book. This is definitely a picture book that could have been expanded though and wouldn't suffer from the expansion. 
 I highly recommend this book. It's a memorable story, and one that can be read and reread every year at Christmas time.",0.0,0,1046,1035.54,0.99,97,2,4,4
2052,Night Road,Kristin Hannah,2011,2011,"For a mother, life comes down to a series of choices.
To hold on...
To let go..
To forget...
To forgive...
Which road will you take? 
For eighteen years, Jude Farraday has put her children's needs above her own, and it shows--her twins, Mia and Zach, are bright and happy teenagers. When Lexi Baill moves into their small, close knit community, no one is more welcoming than Jude. Lexi, a former foster child with a dark past, quickly becomes Mia's best friend. Then Zach falls in love with Lexi and the three become inseparable.
Jude does everything to keep her kids safe and on track for college. It has always been easy--until senior year of high school. Suddenly she is at a loss. Nothing feels safe anymore; every time her kids leave the house, she worries about them.
On a hot summer's night her worst fears come true. One decision will change the course of their lives. In the blink of an eye, the Farraday family will be torn apart and Lexi will lose everything. In the years that follow, each must face the consequences of that single night and find a way to forget...or the courage to forgive.
NIGHT ROAD is vivid, emotionally complex novel that raises profound questions about motherhood, identity, love, and forgiveness. It is a luminous, heartbreaking novel that captures both the exquisite pain of loss and the stunning power of hope. This is Kristin Hannah at her very best, telling an unforgettable story about the longing for family, the resilience of the human heart, and the courage it takes to forgive the people we love.",Fiction,Excellent,2,5,11,8.0,3,4.17,59265,3.0,"The characters were well-formed but the two life-changing events were too-well foreshadowed when the focus was on the teenagers.

2053,Flight Behavior,Barbara Kingsolver,2012,2012,"Flight Behavior takes on one of the most contentious subjects of our time: climate change. With a deft and versatile empathy Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world.
Flight Behavior transfixes from its opening scene, when a young woman's narrow experience of life is thrown wide with the force of a raging fire. In the lyrical language of her native Appalachia, Barbara Kingsolver bares the rich, tarnished humanity of her novel's inhabitants and unearths the modern complexities of rural existence. Characters and reader alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory here, into the unsettled ground of science, faith, and everyday truces between reason and conviction.
Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen. Now, after a decade of domestic disharmony on a failing farm, she has settled for permanent disappointment but seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation with a younger man. As she hikes up a mountain road behind her house to a secret tryst, she encounters a shocking sight: a silent, forested valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand it as a cautionary miracle, but it sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists, religious leaders, and the media. The bewildering emergency draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists, opportunists, sightseers, and a striking biologist with his own stake in the outcome. As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle, Dellarobia confronts her family, her church, her town, and a larger world, in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed.
Flight Behavior takes on one of the most contentious subjects of our time: climate change. With a deft and versatile empathy Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world.",Fiction,Intermediate,8,3,13,9.75,2,3.76,58112,2.0,"I love Barbara Kingsolver. All of her books automatically go on my to-read list, because she's brilliant. One of the things I love about her is how unique her books are from one another. She writes different kind of characters in disparate environments and focuses on varying themes. I find it so impressive when authors can reinvent themselves so often. Flight Behavior is my fourth Kingsolver book. Unfortunately, unlike the others, this one failed to meet my expectations. 
 My first Kingsolver read was The Bean Trees, which centers around a girl desperate to get out of her small, hick town where most of the girls are pregnant before they even leave high school. She wants to be one of the ones to leave and never come back. Through some odd circumstances, she finds herself stuck raising a baby that's not hers, sort of falling into motherhood. The plot itself didn't have much appeal for me as a reader, but the book was utterly compelling and I loved it so much. Kingsolver's powerful writing and intriguing, quirky characters pulled me in despite myself. 
 In Flight Behavior, Kingsolver again focuses on a heroine who had dreams of escaping her hick town, but this one didn't make it. Dellarobia hoped to go to college, but wound up pregnant instead. Even worse, the baby boy died, leaving her stuck in a marriage with a man she doesn't respect and reliant on judgmental in-laws. Her unhappiness manifests itself in a wandering eye; she has had a number of crushes on men, flirted with the idea of an affair. The hook of the novel is when Dellarobia heads up the mountain to meet with one of her men and cheat on her husband. On her way, she sees the forest burning with butterflies, and interprets that as a sign from God that she needs to go back to her life and make good. 
 Dellarobia's life certainly is unfortunate, and it's such a shame that her promise was wasted on this small town, where kids only take two years of rudimentary math in school. Even the bright ones aren't given enough education to be able to get out of town. I feel for her, but I didn't connect with her or any of the other characters. In all of Kingsolver's previous works, I was held rapt in unfamiliar worlds by the power of the characters and the writing, but these characters simply failed to grab onto my heart and take hold. 
 Another problem too is that, while the writing is beautiful as always (and shows that you can not write in dialect but still achieve a southern feel), the story feels a bit like a combination of two of the Kingsolver books I'd previously read: The Bean Trees and Prodigal Summer. Revisiting old themes, while not what I know Kingsolver for, can be done well, but, in this case, it felt repetitive and less well done. 
 Flight Behavior feels like it was written not so much for the characters as to be the vehicle for a message: global warming is real and it's not just about changing temperatures. Now, of course, it's alright for books to have a moral, a message, but I don't like to feel like I'm being beat over the head with it or being talked down to. 
 The butterflies Dellarobia witnessed normally wintered in Mexico, but moved to her small town because of environmental changes and now the whole population of Monarch butterflies could be in danger of extinction. A lepidopterist comes to study them, and works with and teaches Dellarobia, highlighting her boredom with her husband and her desire for something bigger. Because of her rudimentary education, the reader receives both the scientific explanations for everything and the 'country' version, a cute little metaphor for everything that's happening. This felt a bit insulting to me, as though this setting was chosen to allow for global warming to be explained in a simplified way that the stupid disbelievers could fathom. Prodigal Summer also dealt with the importance of taking care of the environment, but did not make me feel so lectured. 
 Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh, but I'm disappointed to have not enjoyed a book by one of my favorite authors. Her writing is still gorgeous, but the book is massive, slow, and filled with a lot of minutiae about Dellarobia's life I could have done without. Surely others will appreciate this one (most of the reviews on Goodreads are highly flattering and NPR approves), but it fell flat with me.",184.0,1,4360,4316.4,0.99,1085,4,2,3
2054,The Orphan Master’S Son,Adam Johnson,2012,2012,"19 hrs 22 min
An epic novel and a thrilling literary discovery, The Orphan Master's Son follows a young man's journey through the icy waters, dark tunnels, and eerie spy chambers of the world's most mysterious dictatorship, North Korea.
Pak Jun Do is the haunted son of a lost mother--a singer ""stolen"" to Pyongyang--and an influential father who runs Long Tomorrows, a work camp for orphans. There the boy is given his first taste of power, picking which orphans eat first and which will be lent out for manual labor. Recognized for his loyalty and keen instincts, Jun Do comes to the attention of superiors in the state, rises in the ranks, and starts on a road from which there will be no return.
Considering himself ""a humble citizen of the greatest nation in the world,"" Jun Do becomes a professional kidnapper who must navigate the shifting rules, arbitrary violence, and baffling demands of his Korean overlords in order to stay alive. Driven to the absolute limit of what any human being could endure, he boldly takes on the treacherous role of rival to Kim Jong Il in an attempt to save the woman he loves, Sun Moon, a legendary actress ""so pure, she didn't know what starving people looked like.""
Part breathless thriller, part story of innocence lost, part story of romantic love, The Orphan Master's Son is also a riveting portrait of a world heretofore hidden from view: a North Korea rife with hunger, corruption, and casual cruelty but also camaraderie, stolen moments of beauty, and love. A towering literary achievement, The Orphan Master's Son ushers Adam Johnson into the small group of today's greatest writers.

 Do you enjoy political satire? Then this book will be right up your alley. But I don't. 
 Do you enjoy a puzzle? Would it be intriguing to you to figure out what is fantasy and what is real? Again, if you answer in the affirmative, you will most probably enjoy this book. Me, I like to have a firm handle on the events. I want to understand what is definitely happening. You see in North Korea what Kim Jong Il said, was true even if it wasn't. What he claimed was reality. Stories become reality, reality, if claimed to be false, well it never happened! In this novel, one person is two and you never know who the impostor is. I have to understand what I read. I have to have a tight grip on the truth. 
 There are three narrators, both in the written and audio version. One is the radio broadcaster's spewing out the leader's diatribes. Everyone understands that immediately. The other two are much harder to comprehend. Here again, if you are a reader who enjoys figuring this out you will be happy when you finally understand that that one voices the events of the present and the other of the past. 
 Yes, there is humor, but again not to my taste. Political guffaws do abound. 
 Are you OK with gruesome depiction of torture methods? I am not.

 I have never really been a Stephen King Fan. Although there are a few books in his lineup that I have very much enjoyed. I loved the Green Mile, and I kind of like Carrie.

The men and boys are all a bit in love with Mrs Jacobs; the women and girls - including Jamie's mother and beloved sister - feel the same about Reverend Jacobs. With Jamie, the Reverend shares a deeper bond, based on their fascination with simple experiments in electricity.
Then tragedy strikes the Jacobs family; the preacher curses God, mocking all religious belief, and is banished from the shocked town.
Jamie has demons of his own. In his mid-thirties, he is living a nomadic lifestyle of bar-band rock and roll. Addicted to heroin, stranded, desperate, he sees Jacobs again - a showman on stage, creating dazzling 'portraits in lightning' - and their meeting has profound consequences for both men. Their bond becomes a pact beyond even the Devil's devising, and Jamie discovers that revivalhas many meanings. Because for every cure there is a price...
This rich and disturbing novel spans five decades on its way to the most terrifying conclusion Stephen King has ever written. It's a masterpiece from King, in the great American tradition of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe.",Fiction,Intermediate,10,1,14,5.0,10,3.75,2384,3.0,"When Jamie Morton first encounters the Reverend Charles Daniel Jacobs, he is six years old. Jacobs cures his brother's muteness, only to leave town a broken man when his wife and son are killed. Jamie and the Rev will cross paths again and again as the Rev seeks to master what he calls the secret electricity, the energy that powers the universe... 
 I found this book to be an extremely mixed bag, which you'll read in a moment. 
 Revival follows the life of Jamie Morton, a rhythm guitarist, whose life intersects with Charles Jacobs, a priest/huckster/mad scientist who things electricity is the key to most of life's mysteries. I'm going to keep this as spoiler-free as possible. 
 Since Stephen King produces best sellers more often than I wash my car, I tend to forget what a great writer he is. I think if he didn't love scaring the piss out of people, he probably would have been a literary writer of some renown. The characters he creates in this seem very real, with an exception I'll cover in a minute. The picture he paints of Jamie Morton's life is very well written, warts and all. 
 While I enjoyed reading the book due to the Kingliness of the writing, it wasn't all that exciting. I was interested in Jamie's journey from rock and roller to drug addict to studio musician but the meat of the story was whenever he crossed paths with Charles Jacobs, or whatever he was calling himself at the time. Structurally, it reminded me of The Shining. There was a long buildup with just enough teasing to keep me interested. If it wasn't for the ending, I probably would have given this a two. 
 The other thing that didn't quite sit right is that Jacobs evolved from being one cartoonish stereotype to another, from devout priest to carny to evangelist to scene-chewing villain. He's the one character I never really believed in. Also, what's with Stephen King's recent obsession with carnies? Doctor Sleep and Joyland both featured them and now this one. 
 All that being said, I was entertained by Revival but not enthralled by it. I LOVED the glimpse of the afterlife at the end. ""That is not dead which can eternal lie"" indeed. Also, the King Easter eggs were also cool. 
 I didn't love it but it's definitely better than Joyland, Doctor Sleep, and Mr. Mercedes. We'll call it 3.5 out of 5.",143.0,1,2916,14550.84,4.99,953,3,4,4

Judge Raymond Fawcett has just become number five.
Who is the Racketeer? And what does he have to do with the judge's untimely demise? His name, for the moment, is Malcolm Bannister. Job status? Former attorney. Current residence? The Federal Prison Camp near Frostburg, Maryland.
On paper, Malcolm's situation isn't looking too good these days, but he's got an ace up his sleeve. He knows who killed Judge Fawcett, and he knows why. The judge's body was found in his remote lakeside cabin. There was no forced entry, no struggle, just two dead bodies: Judge Fawcett and his young secretary. And one large, state-of-the-art, extremely secure safe, opened and emptied.
What was in the safe? The FBI would love to know. And Malcolm Bannister would love to tell them. But everything has a price--especially information as explosive as the sequence of events that led to Judge Fawcett's death. And the Racketeer wasn't born yesterday . . .

David Mitchell is an eloquent conjurer of intricate, interconnected tales, a genre-bending daredevil, and a master prose stylist. Rich with character and realms of possibility, The Bone Clocksis a hypnotic puzzle of a novel that makes you want to take it apart and and put back together the very moment you reach the final page.
Following a scalding row with her mother, fifteen-year-old Holly Sykes slams the door on her old life. But Holly is no typical teenage runaway: a sensitive child once contacted by voices she knew only as ""the radio people,"" Holly is a lightning rod for psychic phenomena. Now, as she wanders deeper into the English countryside, visions and coincidences reorder her reality until they assume the aura of a nightmare brought to life.
For Holly has caught the attention of a cabal of dangerous mystics--and their enemies. But her lost weekend is merely the prelude to a shocking disappearance that leaves her family irrevocably scarred. This unsolved mystery will echo through every decade of Holly's life, affecting all the people Holly loves--even the ones who are not yet born.

(I've written about this before.) When Cloud Atlas came out in cinemas and everyone raved about it, I found out David Mitchell exists and promptly began reading Ghostwritten. Which was great. I then allowed myself to go with the crowd for Cloud Atlas and found it very good, if slightly tiring and self-aware in parts. With this extensive sample of two books, I was firmly on Mitchell's side, praising his skilled blend of believable, well-written characters and insidious magical realism. 
 Well, The Bone Clocks took it down a (serious) notch. Mitchell doesn't miss a beat when switching voices from a rebellious, know-it-all teenage girl to a self-important Cambridge student or a war correspondent torn between family and work. And these lifelike, well-developed characters pull you into their (particular, but surely not miraculous or exceptional) stories. And you read on, and you get invested, and you pick favorites, and then... 
 BAM! Here comes the magical/mystical/""the truth is out there"" plot, thrown in with a heavy hand, excruciatingly long monologues and enough made-up words to send Rowling and Tolkien spinning. The ""skilled blend"" I was in awe of? Totally gone; about a quarter of the book is a predictable mess of the good guys and the bad guys battling it out for people's souls, and that quarter is thrown is apparently random and then almost never touched on for the rest of the book. (Another quarter of the book is not an epilogue. If you want the mystical... stuff to be the main plot, end with it.)

2064,The Constant Princess,Philippa Gregory,2005,2005,"""I am Catalina, Princess of Spain, daughter of the two greatest monarchs the world has ever known...and I will be Queen of England.""
Thus, bestselling author Philippa Gregory introduces one of her most unforgettable heroines: Katherine of Aragon. Daughter of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain, Katherine has been fated her whole life to marry Prince Arthur of England. When they meet and are married, the match becomes as passionate as it is politically expedient. The young lovers revel in each other's company and plan the England they will make together. But tragically, aged only fifteen, Arthur falls ill and extracts from his sixteen-year-old bride a deathbed promise to marry his brother, Henry; become Queen; and fulfill their dreams and her destiny.
""They tell me nothing but lies here and they think they can break my spirit. I believe what I choose and say nothing. I am not as simple as I seem.""
Widowed and alone in the avaricious world of the Tudor court, Katherine has to sidestep her father-in-law's desire for her and convince him, and an incredulous Europe, that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated, that there is no obstacle to marriage with Henry. For seven years, she endures the treachery of spies, the humiliation of poverty, and intense loneliness and despair while she waits for the inevitable moment when she will step into the role she has prepared for all her life. Then, like her warrior mother, Katherine must take to the battlefield and save England when its old enemies the Scots come over the border and there is no one to stand against them but the new Queen.
""It was my dying husband's hope, my mother's wish, and God's will that I should be Queen of England; and for them and for the country, I will be Queen of England until I die.""
Raised on the battlefield and in the most beautiful Moorish palace in the world, sent to England alone at the age of sixteen to take her place in a court where she couldn't speak the language, and abandoned and forced to endure poverty after the death of her husband, Katherine remained a woman of indomitable spirit, unwavering faith, and extraordinary strength.

 Well, to be perfectly honest with you, I think this book took to much to build up. Perhaps that's what this book's about or you know, books in general.

It's the early 1980s--the country is in a deep recession, and life after college is harder than ever. In the cafes on College Hill, the wised-up kids are inhaling Derrida and listening to Talking Heads. But Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English major, is writing her senior thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot, purveyors of the marriage plot that lies at the heart of the greatest English novels.
As Madeleine tries to understand why ""it became laughable to read writers like Cheever and Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about deflowering virgins in eighteenth-century France,"" real life, in the form of two very different guys, intervenes. Leonard Bankhead--charismatic loner, college Darwinist, and lost Portland boy--suddenly turns up in a semiotics seminar, and soon Madeleine finds herself in a highly charged erotic and intellectual relationship with him. At the same time, her old ""friend"" Mitchell Grammaticus--who's been reading Christian mysticism and generally acting strange--resurfaces, obsessed with the idea that Madeleine is destined to be his mate.
Over the next year, as the members of the triangle in this amazing, spellbinding novel graduate from college and enter the real world, events force them to reevaluate everything they learned in school. Leonard and Madeleine move to a biology Laboratory on Cape Cod, but can't escape the secret responsible for Leonard's seemingly inexhaustible energy and plunging moods. And Mitchell, traveling around the world to get Madeleine out of his mind, finds himself face-to-face with ultimate questions about the meaning of life, the existence of God, and the true nature of love.
Are the great love stories of the nineteenth century dead? Or can there be a new story, written for today and alive to the realities of feminism, sexual freedom, prenups, and divorce? With devastating wit and an abiding understanding of and affection for his characters, Jeffrey Eugenides revives the motivating energies of the Novel, while creating a story so contemporary and fresh that it reads like the intimate journal of our own lives.",Fiction,Novice,8,2,15,9.375,13,3.43,87,3.0,"BookFiendUSA: So, how was it? My GR friends' reviews are all over the place on this one. How does it compare to Virgin Suicides or Middlesex? 
 SandyBanks1971: It's...OK. Not badly written at all, but nothing incredible either. I can't compare it with Eugenides' earlier works, as I have never read anything by him before. 
 BookFiendUSA: Seriously? You've never even seen the Sofia Coppola movie? 
 SandyBanks1971: Nope. But I've read the synopses of the earlier books, and I can tell you that there are absolutely no virgins, suicides or hermaphrodites in this one. Instead, we get a manic-depressive, a wannabe Christian and an English major. 
 BookFiendUSA: No hermaphrodites? 
 SandyBanks1971: No. But there is a Marriage Plot. 
 BookFiendUSA: Explain. 
 SandyBanks1971: It's a common plot in 18th and 19th century literature. Typically, there is this girl --- the heroine --- and she has to choose between different suitors, and there will be all sorts of hijinks (pride, prejudices, misunderstandings, madwomen in the attic, etc.) before the nuptial payoff. Austen, Eliot and the Brontes used it extensively in their books. 
 BookFiendUSA: It's a romcom! 
 SandyBanks1971: Something like that. The heroine in this book, Madeline, is an English major (""English was what people who didn't know what to major in majored in."") who is steeped in these books and has to choose between Leonard, the brooding, brilliant manic depressive, and Mitchell, the earnest, spiritually inclined sensitive guy. I looked forward to how Eugenides is going to use this sort of plot in a modern setting and how he is going to resolve it. As one of Madeline's professor muses, ""What would it matter whom Emma married if she could file for separation later?"" ""How would Isabel Archer's marriage to Gilbert Osmond have been affected by the existence of a prenup? ... Where could you find the marriage plot nowadays?"" I'm also curious about whether the central romantic triangle is based on any particular 19th century novel (Franzen recently did this in Freedom). 
 BookFiendUSA: So ---? 
 SandyBanks1971: Eugenides does use the marriage plot, but the ending is a sort of a deconstruction of its traditional form. After all, in an age of gender equality and easy divorces, how could the Marriage Plot still matter? Leonard is obviously the Heathcliff type, and Mitchell is maybe a mix between Linton and St. John Rivers. Madeline is --- actually I don't quite know who she really is, especially compared to the male protagonists. Eugenides gives her a pretty extensive biography, and an intermittent ambition to go to grad school and write for literary reviews, but other than that, she seems to be merely a flimsy foil for her suitors. Early on, we are told that she loves Austen and James, but unlike Mitchell and Leonard, whose lives are transformed by the books that they read, there seems to be hardly any connection between her and those books. In a pivotal moment, she reflects on...Madeline. Yes, this Madeline, the little convent schoolgirl from Paris. 
 Leonard ruminates on Nietzche and Mitchell has his Thomas Merton inspired epiphanies, and Madeline thinks deeply about Madeline? Why can't she reflect on Wuthering Heights? Or, I dunno, Middlemarch? Or Persuasion? We never learn about what Madeline really thinks of the marriage plot --- and the obvious parallels to her private life --- either (her thesis is, after all, titled: ""I Thought You'd Never Ask: Some Thoughts on the Marriage Plot""). If The Marriage Plot is meant to be a modern reworking of an Austen or Bronte novel, this lack of development of her character is big minus. 
 BookFiendUSA: Okay, so the major female character is lame. I get it. I'd rather read a ton of Madeline books than a Henry James, though. Now, some people think that this novel is terribly pretentious, with its Ivy League setting, WASP characters and lengthy Barthes quotations. Do you agree? 
 SandyBanks1971: Not necessarily. I mean, he's writing about life in an Ivy League campus --- is there going to be an egghead or two, trust-fund babies, and academic egotists on steroid? You bet. To be fair, some of the kids are wealthy WASP types, but Leonard needs financial aid, and Mitchell is Greek and strictly middle class. There's lots of name-dropping, but in most cases, they're followed by sufficient exposition. The quotes are necessary to understand the characters' mindset, as they live in books as much as in the real world. And Eugenides is actually poking fun, wryly, at some of the faddish academic theories: 
 ""Madeline had a feeling that most semiotic theorists had been unpopular as children, often bullied or overlooked, and so had directed their lingering rage onto literature. They wanted to demote the author. They wanted a book, that hard-won, transcendent thing to be a text, contingent, indeterminate, and open for suggestions. They wanted the reader to be the main thing. Because they were readers."" 
 BookFiendUSA: Anything else that you like? 
 SandyBanks1971: I like how he writes about being in your early twenties, just out of college with your whole life stretching ahead of you. Grappling with issues, intellectual or otherwise. How everything seems to be of looming importance. How stuff happens, sometimes casually, that determine how you life the rest of your life. I think he captures that well, and can be quite eloquent about it. So I guess I'll check out the suicides and hermaphrodites.",30.0,1,5697,29168.64,5.12,427,4,2,2

The moon looks down as the boy returns to shore with his boat and his book. 
 Collins offers children a book that truly introduces them to poetry.

2077,Ender'S Shadow,Orson Scott Card,1999,1999,"Ender's Shadowis being dubbed as a parallel novel to Orson Scott Card's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Ender's Game. By ""parallel,"" Card means that Shadowbegins and ends at roughly the same time as Game, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity's fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of Shadow, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know.
Although it may seem like Shadowis merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous Ender's Game, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of Ender's Gamehinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, Shadowmanages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that Shadow, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. --Craig E.

 SWEDISH REVIEW 
 Om det ar nagot Mo Hayder kan sa ar det att skriva bocker som gar under skinnet pa en. Precis som Dennis Lehane sa vagar hon ta ut svangarna och det ar med isande fasa man laser varje sida. 
 Forsvunnen ar inget undantag. Att lasa om kidnappade barn ar hemskt och man vet inte om Jack Caffery kommer att lyckas radda situationen. Caffery ar en lysande polis, men i denna bok sa verkar det som om kidnapparen kan forutse polisen nasta drag och ju mer tiden gar desto mer lutar det at att det ar forsent, att flickan inte kommer att raddas. 
 Sedan har vi polisdykaren Flea Marley, som lever med konsekvenserna fran foregaende bok, vilket stor henne i jobbet. Hon vet inte om att Jack misstanker henne for ett brott som hon faktiskt ar oskyldig till men som i och med det Jack vet om det ter sig logiskt att han misstanker henne. Nu ger hon sig in kampen for att radda den kidnappade flickan. Men ar hon verkligen i form att ta sig an fallet? Kommer hon istallet bara att riskera sitt eget liv? 
 Forsvunnen ar en ruggig thriller dar den okande forovaren hela tiden lurar i bakgrunden och man sitter pa helspand pa slutet nar Caffery konfronterar forovaren. Fragan ar kommer allting att sluta lyckligt?

 ENGLISH REVIEW 
 If there is one thing Mo Hayder knows is it to write a book that crawls under your skin. She dares, just like Dennis Lehane can she write in such a way that it's with terror you turn each page. 
 Gone is no exception. Reading about kidnapped children is always terrible and you do not know if Jack Caffery will be able to save the kidnapped girl. Caffery is a brilliant police, but in this book, the kidnapper seems to anticipate every single move the police do, and as more time goes by, the fear grows that they will be too late. 
 Then we have police diver Flea Marley, who lives with the consequences from the previous book, which has consequences for her at work. She does not know that Jack suspects her for a crime she's actually innocent of. Although it's quite logical that he suspects her since he doesn't have the whole picture. Now she decides to search for the kidnapped girl. But, is she really in shape to help out? Or will she only risk her own life? 
 Gone is a tough thriller where the unidentified perpetrator always lurks in the background, and at the end, when Caffery confronts the perpetrator will you still question if everything will end happily...

2079,Breakfast At Tiffany'S,Truman Capote,1958,1974,"It's New York in the 1940s, where the martinis flow from cocktail hour till breakfast at Tiffany's. And nice girls don't, except, of course, Holly Golightly. Pursued by Mafia gangsters and playboy millionaires, Holly is a fragile eyeful of tawny hair and turned-up nose, a heart-breaker, a perplexer, a traveller, a tease. She is irrepressibly 'top banana in the shock department', and one of the shining flowers of American fiction.
This edition also contains three stories: 'House of Flowers', 'A Diamond Guitar' and 'A Christmas Memory'.",Fiction,Intermediate,10,12,16,15.0,16,3.89,28,4.0,"Everyone agrees that some characters are immortal, that even though you did not read the stories you still know those characters. 
 For me, some of them are also immortal by the actors who played them, so for example Scarlett O'Hara is always Vivien Leigh, and Holly Golightly can be no one but Audrey Hepburn. 
 Usually this bothers me, the way the movie may influence my reaction to the book, but not with Breakfast at Tiffany's. This story has a different feeling, it's the kind of stories that leaves you to think a lot after finishing it, even though its plot is really not that complicated. 
 I don't think i can say anything new about this book, i am just glad i finally read it. 
 Holly Golightly is a fascinating character, the book seemed to be just a sneak peek into her life during a small moment and after that she was gone again. 
 I liked better the original end of the story, it seemed more realistic than the way they made it in the movie adaptation. 
 One last thing to add is that i found it strange that the same person who wrote In Cold Blood wrote also Breakfast at Tiffany's. Strange and fascinating!",2.0,1,800,792.0,0.99,140,2,2,3

While many hold up ""Catcher in the Rye"" as the zenith of his achievements for me it will always be this wistful and brave little book. I re-read it two or three times or year. I love it that much. 
 To be honest out of the nine stories collected here I would say that only a third are Salinger's best. ""Perfect Day for Banafish,"" ""For Esme - With Love and Squalor,"" and ""The Laughing Man"" are to me the peaks of short fiction. Everything that Salinger does best he does in these three tales. Nobody wrote children better than him. They leap off the page at you right into your lap. Esme, her brother, Seymour's little friend and the narrator of ""Laughing Man"" are so vivid and real you feel like running them all down the street for ice cream and cake. They are that true to life. 
 Same goes for Seymour in ""Banana Fish"" and the narrator of ""For Esme."" Nobody got into the heads of brilliant but troubled young people better than Salinger. What we hear about Seymour as opposed to what we see creates a palpable (and beautiful)tension. The narrator of ""For Esme""'s war inflicted emotional problems are drawn with such artistry as to flood over you as you read. 
 ""Uncle Wiggly in Connecticut,"" ""Daumier-Smith's Blue Period,"" and ""War with the Eskimos"" to me fall into the ""damn entertaining but not great"" category. These stories are beautifully observed, funny, poignant and always a pleasure to read but lack that magic the first three have to spare. Of course that being said even being good but not great Salinger makes them better than most. 
 Finally ""Teddy,"" ""Down in the Dinghy"" and ""Pretty Mouth Green My Eyes"" are good stories but I feel they suffer from being collected in the same book as the others. Each alone is enthralling but not a one of them is a patch on ""Esme,"" or ""Bananafish."" Where the other stories feel like a full meal these come off more like snacks. Tasty but not quite filling.

2081,Voyage,Sterling Hayden,1977,1999,A magnificent epic of the sea and a dynamic portrait of turn-of-the-century America. Publishers Weekly,Fiction,Intermediate,10,5,10,8.2,10,4.12,107,5.0,"Voyage reads like Whitman and Melville in a drinking contest, recognizing the attraction and dangers of the sea, the highs and lows that come with living on your own terms. Hayden had lived most of his life on a boat. When he lived in France, he lived on a boat in various docks. His love for the sea began at Long Wharf in Boston and Sausalito is where Hayden set his last anchor. NY-born and patrician Bogart had a schooner named Santana, and Hayden had his schooner Wanderer. There is no doubt that Hayden was a flawed man of Lear contradictions: he drank, railed against many things, but it seemed that he distrusted the things that came easy to him...such as acting. He disliked the Hollywood factories for creating illusion; politicians, for perpetuating other illusions and; railed against what he was seeing America become. He was outspoken about his political activism, his drinking and occasional drug use in his interviews with Tom Synder, where he looks like the future Keith Richards, but betrays himself as a writer. Hayden lived his life at odds with the `American dream,' climbing up and down the ladder of success several times over. He was a nonconformist who believed in the examined life. It is impossible not to notice the pattern that just as he was about to touch the brass ring he would walk away; but in the writing he is simply majestic, poetic, and provocative. I'd argue that his prose rivals with the best of the twentieth century's best writers.",4.0,1,2733,8171.670000000001,2.99,24,3,3,4
2082,The Blind Assassin,Margaret Atwood,2000,2001,"Margaret Atwood takes the art of storytelling to new heights in a dazzling novel that unfolds layer by astonishing layer and concludes in a brilliant and wonderfully satisfying twist. Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and cliches of the 1930s and 1940s, The Blind Assassin is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience.
It opens with these simple, resonant words: ""Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge."" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a- novel. Entitled The Blind Assassin, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.
For the past twenty-five years, Margaret Atwood has written works of striking originality and imagination. In The Blind Assassin, she stretches the limits of her accomplishments as never before, creating a novel that is entertaining and profoundly serious. The Blind Assassin proves once again that Atwood is one of the most talented, daring, and exciting writers of our time. Like The Handmaid's Tale, it is destined to become a classic.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,7,6,14,8.857142857142858,15,3.95,100153,0.0,Recommended by my best friend,0.0,0,236,1885.64,7.99,378,1,2,3

2084,Doctor Sleep,Stephen King,2013,2013,"Stephen King returns to the characters and territory of one of his most popular novels ever, The Shining, in this instantly riveting novel about the now middle-aged Dan Torrance (the boy protagonist of The Shining) and the very special 12-year-old girl he must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals.
On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless - mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky 12-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the ""steam"" that children with the ""shining"" produce when they are slowly tortured to death.
Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant ""shining"" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes ""Doctor Sleep.""
Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan's own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra's soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of hyper-devoted fans of The Shining and wildly satisfy anyone new to the territory of this icon in the King canon.",Fiction,Intermediate,21,1,15,6.857142857142857,8,4.1,98088,4.0,"There is a boy (now a man) a girl, a band of baddies with a charismatic leader, a coalition of the willing, battles to be fought, supernatural elements and magical powers. Stephen King was at this long before Harry Potter lived under the stairs. He has a preternatural (not to say supernatural) talent for writing kids, and can keep you turning pages, losing sleep, and getting back late to work from your lunch breaks. 
 We will presume for the purposes of this review that you have read, or at least seen one version of The Shining. If you have not, read no further, as there are details here that would be considered spoilerish were they to appear in a review of that book. And if you have not read The Shining you should probably do so before taking on Doctor Sleep, a sequel. Ok, everyone here has read The Shining, yes? All right, but we are using the honor system here, and do not want to ruin the fun of reading that one for anyone. So, as long as you're sure... 
 At the end of The Shining, three people survive the carnage, Danny Torrance, a five year old with a special gift, Wendy Torrance, Danny's mother and newly widowed wife of the late Jack Torrance, and Dick Halloran, an employee of The Overlook and possessor of a gift like Danny's, one that allowed him to hear Danny's psychic 911 call and return from his home in Florida in time to do something about it. What happened next? 
 from King's site 
 King does not typically do sequels, if one does not count books that are part of a planned series, but Every now and then somebody would ask, 'Whatever happened to Danny?' I used to joke around and say, 'He married Charlie McGee from Firestarter and they had these amazing kids!' But I did sort of wonder about it. - (from EW)One of the central features of The Shining was Jack's Torrance's battle with alcoholism. As with the real world, King's fictional realm notes that alcoholism runs in families. And one of the criticisms of The Shining was that the possibility of Jack considering getting some help from AA is never even raised. If King has ever considered that to have been an oversight, I have not seen that interview. But it is clear that he has given the matter some thought. Jack Torrance never tries Alcoholics Anonymous. That is never even mentioned in ""The Shining."" He has what they call white-knuckle sobriety. He's doing it all by himself. So, I wondered what it would be like to see Danny first as an alcoholic, and then see him in AA. (from an NPR Interview)It gives nothing away to let you know that Danny is a true Torrance. Not only does he self-medicate to quiet the terrors that still haunt him, he is far from the best person he can be.I knew if I did this sequel I'd have to try to put together some of the same elements, but at the same time I didn't want to make it too similar. I didn't want to make Danny a grown up with kids of his own, and try to replicate that whole losing-your-temper-because-you're-drunk thing. But I did think to myself: 'Not only alcoholism can be a family disease, but rage can be a family disease.' You find that the guys who abuse their children were abused themselves as kids. That certainly fit Danny as I knew him. - from EW 
 All SK novels require a baddie, or a set of them. No disappointment here. King has again succeeded in taking the ordinary and making it horrifying.Driving back and forth from Maine to Florida, which I do twice a year, I'm always seeing all these recreational vehicles -- the bounders in the Winnebagos. I always think to myself, 'Who is in those things?' You pass them a thousand times at rest stops. They're always the ones wearing the shirts that say 'God Does Not Deduct From a Lifespan Time Spent Fishing.' They're always lined up at the McDonald's, slowing the whole line down. And I always thought to myself, 'There's something really sinister about those people because they're so unobtrusive, yet so pervasive.' I just wanted to use that. It would be the perfect way to travel around America and be unobtrusive if you were really some sort of awful creature. - from EW 
 This wandering band call themselves The True Knot. They feed on the essence of those gifted with the sort of talent people like Danny possess. It provides them with extraordinary longevity, but as with their Transylvanian counterparts, the need is ongoing and the supply is limited. Like right-wing politicians they are more than happy to gorge on the pain of others and are shown here feasting on the spirits set adrift on 9/11. The usual condiments for this substance they call steam will not do. The taste and benefit is enhanced, however, if their victims endure extreme and prolonged torture. Does Ted Cruz drive a Winnebago? King gives the members Damon Runyon-esque names, like Crow Daddy, Steamboat Steve and Tommy the Truck. 
 By the time you finish reading Doctor Sleep you might have a new image of the top hat to consider next time you are planning a formal night out. We all have one, probably this one: 
 But the baddie in Stephen King's latest is likely to do for the top hat what this guy 
 did for the derby. Rose O'Hara, the leader of a group called The True Knot, won't leave home without it. It adds a nice visual element, calling to mind a certain Caribbean Baron, and making Rosie even more riveting. 
 And what of our young heroine? Abra is born with a shining of prodigious proportions. (btw, the name Abra was inspired by Abra Bacon, a character in East of Eden) She manages to send out a signal even when she is newly arrived. She's a good kid, despite scaring her parents on occasion with tricks like making all the silverware in the kitchen take to the air, or causing the odd earthquake when she does a mental Bruce (or if you prefer, David) Banner. Don't make her angry. You wouldn't like her when she's angry. Bad-ass teen girl power fuh shoo-uh. But, just as Danny needed Dick Hallorann and Tony, Abra needs help as well. That she and Danny will team up is a foregone conclusion. 
 As for Danny, the shining never left him, despite his attempts to wipe it out with spirits of a different sort. But he finds the help he needs and manages to put his talent to good use. He works in a hospice, the Helen Rivington House, in Frazier, NH, easing the transition for those near death, with the assistance of a resident feline, and earning himself the name Doctor Sleep, which also serves to remind us of what his parents called him....It is this moment of transition that Doctor Sleep deals with and the idea, like so many of King's, came from an incidental story in a newspaper. This one was about ""a cat in a hospice that knows when people are going to die. He would go into that patient's room and curl up next to them. And I thought, that's a good advertisement for death, for the emissary of death. I thought, 'I can make Dan the human equivalent of that cat, and call him Doctor Sleep.' There was the book."" - from an interview in The Guardian 
 King has a bit of fun, naming the cat Azzie, short for Azreel, the archangel of death. Cute. 
 What else do you need, really? Dark vs light, colorful baddies vs our everyman and everygirl. And that is indeed enough. But it is not all that King uses. He gives us a look at how people can really help people overcome, or at least handle their problems. When asked, in the NPR interview, whether his AA depictions were from personal experience, King says that the second part of AA stands for Anonymous, so he declined to offer a yes or no, however You could say, having read these two books and knowing that I was a very heavy drinker at the time that I wrote ""The Shining,"" and I haven't had a drink in about 25 years now - you could draw certain conclusions from that...I've done a lot of personal research in these subjects. - from NPR interview 
 AA figures very large in this story, is central really. And the wisdom one can find in AA permeates the novel, from the importance of recognizing that we need help from others, to accepting our past and dealing with it, a very strong, serious element. 
 King sets the time of the events by referring to external realities, like who the president is, calls on contemporary cultural references, such as a mention of the Sons of Anarchy and a Hank Wiliams Jr song. He also mentions a variety of other writers in his travels, some approvingly, (John Sandford, George Seferis, Bernard Malamud, Bill Wilson) some not so much (the authors of the Twilight and Hunger Games series, and Dean Koontz and Lisa Gardner, although he may merely be playing with the latter two). He also drops in an Easter egg reference to Salem's Lot and make two references (that I caught anyway) to his son, Joe's, imagined world from Joe's book, NOS4A2. 
 It has been my experience with reading Stephen King that his conclusions sometimes offer a poor partner to the journey one takes in reaching them. That is much less the case here. The ending is not an alien spider disguised as Tim Curry with bad fashion sense or alien young playing with humans in a ham-fisted manner. And the journey is indeed fun. But I had some gripes. King gives Dick Hallorann a cameo here, which was fine, and the strongest of those. Tony returns for a look-see but goes alarmingly quiet at crucial moments. We could have used a lot more about Tony other than the weak explanation that is offered near the end. If the True Knot are so bad-ass, how come there are so few of them? There is an explanation offered of prey-predator stability of numbers, but I found that unpersuasive. And why the hell introduce Jack if he is not going to be a part of the action? This is one that actively irked. 
 Sequels present a danger. One of the things that is stimulating about any book, any story is newness. That is why most sequels are not as popular as their predecessors. It is hard to avoid a been-there-done-that problem when working atop existing material. The next story in line is unlikely to retain the sparkle, the shine of what went before. Given the constraints, Doctor Sleep fares better than most as a follow-on. There is enough distance in the story from the events of the past, and little enough overlap with those characters that the story seems fresh. When events from The Shining are mentioned, they do inform the current action and do not distract much. In fact there could have been more of that. So, in that way, this is a very nice addition. There is another element involved. Any event, any activity, is a product of the thing itself and of the perspective from which we view or participate in it. I read The Shining many years ago. I was an adult then, in my late twenties, and remember it as a VERY SCARY story. I have not come across much in horror lit that is still scary in that way, in the several decades since. I will not have any nights (on in my case days) of lost sleep because of the images King has proferred. But then, I am getting on, and am looking at those scary things with aging eyes. Someone younger (which would be almost all of you reading this) might find them far more frightening than I did. 
 So while Doctor Sleep might not cause much by way of lost rest, it is good, mainstream Stephen King and thus, hardly a snooze. The Doctor of Horror is in. Wake up!

There are a fair bit of inconsistent and just plain silly things in the story too. For example, the hero having a severe concussion and a broken arm yet still being able to take out a couple of armed rednecks with his quick thinking and fast moves or the fact that they can't escape said rednecks later because the kids aren't wearing their seatbelts. Really? Then buckle their friggin' seatbelts! Just generally poor writing and a lot of contrived plot points.

Amelia has been suspended, effective immediately, and Kate must come get her daughter--now. But Kate's stress over leaving work quickly turns to panic when she arrives at the school and finds it surrounded by police officers, fire trucks, and an ambulance. By then it's already too late for Amelia. And for Kate.
An academic overachiever despondent over getting caught cheating has jumped to her death.At least that's the story Grace Hall tells Kate. And clouded as she is by her guilt and grief, it is the one she forces herself to believe. Until she gets an anonymous text: She didn't jump. 
Reconstructing Ameliais about secret first loves, old friendships, and an all-girls club steeped in tradition. But, most of all, it's the story of how far a mother will go to vindicate the memory of a daughter whose life she couldn't save.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,1,16,16,16.0,2,3.82,88672,1.0,"I wanted to like this, but the writing is really bad. Really bad. Really, really, really bad. Plus, some of the plot points simply made no sense. There are certain things you can suspend your disbelief to and that's fine and normal when it comes to any form of fiction, as long as it makes sense in their world the author created, but there is a limit. There's no way a detective would bring the mother of a victim along with him to interview witnesses and get statements. It..... No, just no. 
 Unless, he wasn't really a detective and was only hired to act like one so Kate could find the truth. If this was the case, then I'm fine with it. However, that doesn't happen. He's just a cop who is investigating the suspicious death of a girl and decides that it would be fun to let the dead girl's mom take lead in the investigation. 
 Yea...that would never happen. Never. 
 Also, the adults sounded and acted like teenagers. Once you get to the end, you'll understand what I mean. The whole thing was just ridiculous. 
 Great potential here, but it's wasted by bad writing, a plot that falls short, and characters that are just too stupid and not believable. 
 I'm seriously disappointed, because I really wanted to like this book and it just fell flat. I could probably write more about how the relationship between Kate and Amelia was mostly showing not telling and despite making it seem like the two were super close, they felt really distant from one another. Or I could write about how the whole Ben subplot was creepy and awkward. Or I could even talk about the Magpies, whose secret circle isn't really all that secret. Or even about how everyone magically reveals their secrets within the last few pages, wrapping up all of the loose ends in a convenient little bow. 
 But I won't. 
 Because the main problem with this novel isn't really the plot, or the lack of brains the characters seem to have, it's the writing. I almost feel like with a better author the stupid plot points maybe would have become plot perks or something. Instead, the book is just lackluster and boring. And a novel with this much potential and this kind of plot shouldn't be boring. 
 Overall: I know there are a lot of people who loved this. Loved it to the point that it's going to be a movie starring Nicole Kidman. But I didn't like it. It was boring. It was unbelievable. And I just didn't enjoy reading this. This is McCreight's debut novel and she did have great ideas, so I'll probably pick up her next book to see what she'll come up with next.

2089,Beowulf,translated by Seamus Heaney,2000,1999,"Song of the Battle and Kings
Beowulfis the earliest extant poem in a modern European language. It was composed in England four centuries before the Norman Conquest. As a social document this great epic poem is invaluable- reflecting a feudal, newly Christian world of heroes and monsters, blood and victory, life and death. As a work of art it is quite unique; Beowulfrings with a beaut, power, and artistry that have kept it alive for more than twelve centuries. The noble simplicity of Beowulf's anonymous Anglo-Saxon singer is recaptured in this vivid translation by Burton Raffel.",Fiction,Novice,10,8,17,10.9,2,3.42,2648,5.0,"What a great read! I'm a sucker for high fantasy so this was right up my alley. It felt like I was reading Tolkien, except this work precedes his by roughly a thousand years, so maybe Tolkein felt like Beowulf. Anyways, the language is beautiful (I read the Burton translation) and the narrative is super engaging. Old tales usually try to convey a message of wisdom and although I haven't analysed this book academically (yet!) I would say the poem seems to point in the direction of questioning the pursuit of power and how power transforms people. With Christian allusions and sacrifice all over the place, I feel pretty confident in my analysis. Maybe I'm totally off but that's what I took from it.

2090,Cell,Robin Cook,2014,2006,"There is a reason cell rhymes with hell.
On October 1, God is in His heaven, the stock market stands at 10,140, most of the planes are on time, and Clayton Riddell, an artist from Maine, is almost bouncing up Boylston Street in Boston. He's just landed a comic book deal that might finally enable him to support his family by making art instead of teaching it. He's already picked up a small (but expensive!) gift for his long-suffering wife, and he knows just what he will get for his boy Johnny. Why not a little treat for himself? Clay is feeling good about the future.
That changes in a hurry. The cause of the devastation is a phenomenon that will come to be known as The Pulse, and the delivery method is a cell phone. Everyone's cell phone. Clay and the few desperate survivors who join him suddenly find themselves in the pitch-black night of civilization's darkest age, surrounded by chaos, carnage, and a human horde that has been reduced to its basest nature...and then begins to evolve.
There is really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clay, an arrow points home to Maine, and as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north they begin to see crude signs confirming their direction. A promise, perhaps. Or a threat...
There are 193 million cell phones in the United States alone. Who doesn't have one? Stephen King's utterly gripping, gory, and fascinating novel doesn't just ask the question,Can you hear me now? It answers it with a vengeance.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,11,13,4.7,16,3.64,2582,4.0,"For some reason, I had seen quite a few bad reviews on Cell before I read it. Not one to usually dislike a King novel, I did go into this one without the highest of expectations and ended up being very pleasantly surprised. 
 The story centers around a mass event that turns anyone who happens to be on their cell phone at the time into a zombie. Mass chaos ensues and a small group of survivors bands together and tries to figure out what is going on and how to stop it. Some of the plot-line does have some similarity to The Stand, but the characters are fairly unique, the dialog is good, and the action keeps rolling along at a fairly brisk pace. 
 I really liked this novel. I knew that I probably would, but it was a nice surprise that it was as good as it was. I am of the opinion that not everything that Stephen King writes is destined to be a classic, but the majority of his work is well above average and I feel that one day he will be given his long overdue kudos and be placed in the literary canon with the other greats of modern literature.",32.0,1,1307,5933.78,4.54,80,2,4,2

A charmingly illustrated poem by former U.S. Poet Laureate Billy Collins takes us on a journey that features magical transformations and makes a nautical adventure out of the act of reading. The interplay between the pictures and the poetry dramatizes how reading can transport us from our own familiar world into the fantastic world of a book. The boy in the boat stands for every reader and every child. Billy Collins is the author of a dozen books of poetry and was called America's most popular poet by the New York Times. He served as U.

So I probably am a tough critic for this one. But I say: this book should not exist. It is a poem about reading (god it is hard to make meta fly), with that hinge right in the middle (which does not let the story unfold page by page, but makes you have to hold on to the line ""and the boy becomes the book"" way longer than is comfortable), and it is over before you knew you were starting.

2092,The Bonesetter'S Daughter,Amy Tan,2001,2001,"In memories that rise like wisps of ghosts, LuLing Young searches for the name of her mother, the daughter of the Famous Bonesetter from the Mouth of the Mountain. Trying to hold on to the evaporating past, she begins to write all that she can remember of her life as a girl in China. Meanwhile, her daughter Ruth, a ghostwriter for authors of self-help books, is losing the ability to speak up for herself in front of the man she lives with and his two teenage daughters. None of her professional sound bites and pat homilies works for her personal life; she knows only how to translate what others want to say.
Ruth starts suspecting that something is terribly wrong with her mother. As a child, Ruth had been constantly subjected to her mother's disturbing notions about curses and ghosts, and to her repeated threats to kill herself, and was even forced by her mother to try to communicate with ghosts. But now LuLing seems less argumentative, even happy, far from her usual disagreeable and dissatisfied self.
While tending to her ailing mother, Ruth discovers the pages LuLing wrote in Chinese, the story of her tumultuous and star-crossed life, and is transported to a backwoods village known as Immortal Heart. There she learns of secrets passed along by a mute nursemaid, Precious Auntie; of a cave where dragon bones are mined, some of which may prove to be the teeth of Peking Man; of the crumbling ravine known as the End of the World, where Precious Auntie's scattered bones lie, and of the curse that LuLing believes she released through betrayal.
Like layers of sediment being removed, each page reveals secrets of a larger mystery: What became of Peking Man? What was the name of the Bonesetter's Daughter? And who was Precious Auntie, whose suicide changed the path of LuLing's life? Within LuLing's calligraphed pages awaits the truth about a mother's heart, what she cannot tell her daughter yet hopes she will never forget.
Set in contemporary San Francisco and in a Chinese village where Peking Man is being unearthed, The Bonesetter's Daughter is an excavation of the human spirit: the past, its deepest wounds, its most profound hopes. The story conjures the pain of broken dreams, the power of myths, and the strength of love that enables us to recover in memory what we have lost in grief. Over the course of one fog-shrouded year, between one season of falling stars and the next, mother and daughter find what they share in their bones through heredity, history, and inexpressible qualities of love.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,16,2,14,8.375,9,3.98,710,5.0,This book is so beautifully written - it's lyrical.

Much is at stake, including the affluent life they lead in their beautiful waterfront condo in Chicago, as she, the killer, and he, the victim, rush haplessly toward the main event. He is a committed cheater. She lives and breathes denial. He exists in dual worlds. She likes to settle scores. He decides to play for keeps. She has nothing left to lose.

They lived the series, almost literally as it took over 20 years from book one to book seven. And, of course, when Mr. King was nearly killed by that accident with the van, many wondered if the saga would ever be complete. I feel Mr. King, himself, wondered the same thing. 
 But as for me, I was a late comer to the show. I have been reading Stephen King for many years now but it was only 2 years ago that I began this series. I knew it was ""complete"" before I began and would therefore be ""safe"" for me to plunge into what has been described as King's masterwork, his magnum opus. As I worked my way through the novels I recognized two major things. First, these novels would not be my favorite of Mr. King's work. For me they weren't always enjoyable reading nor make me feel good, but they would definitely make me ""feel"". Second, I would be as humbled as I could possibly be to see how an author can create something so amazingly complex, and vast in scope and yet keep my attention focused on the tiny aspects of what really matters. 
 This seventh novel in the series was not perfect. At times it seemed to need editing and at times I got a little lost as the complexity threatened to overwhelm me. Many readers were disappointed in the ending but I felt it was just right for this epic series. Few novels have moved me so much as this one nor had me thinking about it so much when I wasn't even actively reading it.

It happened on a tree-lined street in Notting Hill to a woman who seemed to have the perfect life. Ellie Lerner's best friend, Lucy, was murdered in front of her young daughter. And, as best friends do, Ellie dropped everything--her marriage, her job, her life in the Boston suburbs--to travel to London and pick up the pieces of Lucy's life.

2098,Death Comes To Pemberley,P. D. James,2011,2011,"The world is classic Jane Austen. The mystery is vintage P.D. James.
The year is 1803, and Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet have been married for six years. There are now two handsome and healthy sons in the nursery, Elizabeth's beloved sister Jane and her husband Bingley live nearby and the orderly world of Pemberley seems unassailable. But all this is threatened when, on the eve of the annual autumn ball, the guests are preparing to retire for the night when a chaise appears, rocking down the path from Pemberley's wild woodland. As it pulls up, Lydia Wickham - Elizabeth Bennet's younger, unreliable sister - stumbles out screaming that her husband has been murdered.
Two great literary minds - master of suspense P.D. James and literary icon Jane Austen - come together in Death Comes to Pemberley, a bestselling historical crime fiction tribute to Pride and Prejudice. Conjuring the world of Elizabeth Bennet and Mark Darcy and combining the trappings of Regency British society with a classic murder mystery, James creates a delightful mash-up that will intrigue any Janeite.
From the bestselling author of The Murder Room, Children of Men and A Certain Justice, comes a wonderful mixture of the nation's greatest romance and best-loved crime fiction. In 2013, this novel was adapted as a miniseries by the BBC, starring Matthew Rhys as Darcy, Anna Maxwell Martin as Elizabeth Bennet and Jenna Coleman as Lydia Wickham.",Fiction,Novice,13,3,12,5.615384615384615,1,3.21,67065,4.0,"I considered mounting a passionate defense in favor of this lovingly-rendered tribute to Jane Austen, but then I decided I couldn't care less what the naysayers think. If you pick up this gentle whodunit expecting the sartorial sleuthing of Commander Adam Dalgliesh, you will be disappointed. If you read this looking for the ghost of Jane Austen, you will catch but a glimpse of her delicate frame. Although the point of fan-fiction escapes me entirely (I can't help but think of tribute bands; I have no more desire to explore fan-fiction than I would to see my approaching-middle-age cohorts belt out Whitesnake's greatest hits), Death Comes to Pemberley reads like a tender squeeze of affection from one national literary treasure to another. 
 If you do sink into this literary treat, know that your Jane ear will delight in the recaptured cadence of her prose and that you will be enchanted by the sense and sensibilities of Regency Britain. You will encounter familiar names and faces from across the Austen oeuvre; you will be moved by James's piquant touches of the political and social realities of the era. 
 If you aren't able to let go and enjoy Death Comes to Pemberley within its opening pages, put it down, walk away and spend your time reading something better suited to your expectations. 
 P.D. James isn't so many years from meeting Jane in that Great Bibliotheque in the Sky. I can just see these two outrageously smart, sublime writers sharing a pot of tea and chatting about their writing lives. To curl up in a damask wing chair before a merry fire, listening to Jane and Phyllis plotting out a meeting between Adam Dalgliesh and Fitzwilliam Darcy is my vision of heaven.",190.0,1,107,426.93,3.99,1220,1,4,2
