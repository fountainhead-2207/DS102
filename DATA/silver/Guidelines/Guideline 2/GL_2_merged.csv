A Crown of Swords, the eight Wheel of Time book, did little to advance the plot forward. However, ACoS did a great job with character development. Based on other reviews, I have reached the point of the series where the plot grinds to a halt. This is true. I found much of ACoS to be filler. The Ebou Dar subplot particularly felt as if it was going nowhere. While it did end with a climatic scene, it was an unnecessarily long plot angle. Perrin was not featured that much in this book, which is fine. I am only lukewarm on him and I cannot stand Faile. Her jealousy is unreasonable and makes her unbearable. I thought Rand's subplot was decent. His interactions with Min were entertaining. His interactions with Cadsuane were interesting and I am curious to see where they lead. 
 The real strength of ACoS was character development. Mat, as always, continues to become more interesting. I felt he had a real breakthrough by the end. Nynaeve has also improved markedly. Which she still can be unbearable, with her block breaking and her marriage to Lan (finally!), she became a much better character. Egwene seems to be filling into her role as a leader. Rand is finally seeming to ""get it."" He is fairly comfortable in his role, despite the madness creeping in. 
 I was also very excited about the introduction of Moridin. I know that he will play a big role going forward. I think he is a real game changer for the series. I am also glad the Seanchan are back. They are very interested in the mystery about them. I will be interesting to see how they slow down Rand's planning for Tarmon Gaiden. 
 In sum, ACoS was a good, but not great book. I wish the plot would be faster, but so does every other WoT reader. Despite this complaint, the characters really grew, so I was satisfied. As such, I give ACoS four stars.",0.0,0,54000,53460.0,0.99,661,5,5,5,3,3,3,4,4,4
1337,A Dirty Job,Christopher Moore,2006,2007,"Charlie Asher is a pretty normal guy with a normal life, married to a bright and pretty woman who actually loves him for his normalcy. They're even about to have their first child. Yes, Charlie's doing okay--until people start dropping dead around him, and everywhere he goes a dark presence whispers to him from under the streets. Charlie Asher, it seems, has been recruited for a new position: as Death.
It's a dirty job. But, hey! Somebody's got to do it.",Nonfiction,Excellent,5,9,16,11.8,7,4.08,2334,5.0,"<< Kitty! >> 
 Poor Charlie... Not only is he an awkward beta male who lost his wife, but he also has insubordinate employees, an unhelpful sister and sewer harpies to deal with! To cap it all off, his infant daughter can kill people with an innocuous word and he thinks he's Death... 
 This book made me laugh. It also made me cry way more than I expected a Chris Moore book ever could, which either means that he is a genius or that I am, in fact, a weep-bag. ""A Dirty Job"" is set in Moore's San Francisco universe, the one with the Emperor, the vampires and the goth teenagers you might have encountered if you read ""Bloodsucking Fiends"" and ""You Suck: A Love Story"". Moore is deeply deranged, in the best way a human being can be, and it's wonderful. Don't be fooled by the irreverence and blow job jokes: under that layer of crassness, there's a compassionate story. Death is a part of life. A painful, and often terrifying part of life, but Moore somehow took that core subject and wrote a beautiful story about grief, the reasons we go on living and how we deal with the inevitable. It's a surprisingly comforting novel, given all the weird sex jokes... 
 I loved all the characters in the book: even the dumbest ones were still somehow endearing, in that way that makes me wonder what the Hell is wrong with me. The dialogues are surprising and hilarious, the situations quirky but realistic... somehow (expect maybe the hellhounds); it often feels like Moore listens to the deranged conversations I have with my really weird friends. Or perhaps my brain is now so saturated with his words that I channel him when I have a drink? Honestly, it's hard to tell. 
 If you have a gross sense of humor and enjoy funny but deeply touching stories about living, dying, surviving loss, spirituality, absurd word play, the possible oncoming take-over of the world by the forces of darkness and taxidermy, I strongly recommend you get a copy of this book.",12.0,1,48168,47686.32,0.99,707,5,5,5,1,1,1,5,5,5

Even if he is gorgeous and successful Calvin Morrisey. Cal knows commitment is impossible, especially with a woman as cranky as Min Dobbs. Even if she does wear great shoes and keeps him on his toes. When they say good-bye at the end of their evening, they cut their losses and agree never to see each other again.
But Fate has other plans, and it's not long before Min and Cal meet again. Soon, they're dealing with a jealous ex-boyfriend, Krispy Kreme donuts, a determined psychologist, chaos theory, a freakishly intelligent cat, Chicken Marsala, and more risky propositions than either of them ever dreamed of. Including the biggest gamble of all--true love.",Fiction,Intermediate,3,9,11,10.0,15,3.94,72038,2.0,"After reading this, I don't think I'll eat Chicken Marsala ever again. 
 The heroine of this book ate Chicken Marsala in two different restaurants, twice for takeout, at a wedding, at a dinner with her friends and cooked it 4 times with different levels of success. I don't know if there's anything more boring than a person who never tries anything new (if I'd been the hero, I'd have stopped dating her just because of this.) 
 I enjoyed the first part of the book - the humor was not over the top and the plot was wacky but not creepy. Then as the book progressed, I found two of my big pet peeves: adults that don't confront their parents when they're out of line and the demonizing of men. You see, I had a mother like Min's so I totally understand what it is to live with constant criticism regarding my figure. But when I was in my 20s, I had a very firm chat with my Mom about it and told her I wouldn't tolerate that behavior. Did my Mother stop completely? Of course not, but at least now it's manageable and not humiliating like it used to be. And that's why I cannot respect Min who at 33-years old, should not let her mother choose her hairdo, her clothes or the food she eats. 
 I HATED how Cal was demonized because he dated a lot. He was so nice and thoughtful that women fell in love with him in droves and when he realized they were more serious than him, he would break up with them. The bastard! Doesn't he know that once a woman falls in love with him, he owes her a ring no matter his feelings? He made them fall in love! It's his fault! Because you know, women are little girls that cannot take responsibility for their own feelings and must get every man they want. **Throwing up now** 
 Then the ending was so saccharine, I don't think I'll eat anything sweet for a month. 
 The narration was good but I don't think that Cal's voice was distinctive enough. But what makes this narration really irritating is the author's writing style. Almost every line of dialogue ends in 'he said' or 'she said' so after a while, I wanted to shoot myself. I had to speed up this book a lot, just to see if I could stop hearing 'so and so said' after every sentence. 
 Because I liked the humor, I was thinking that I should give this author another shot, but then I thought that for the first time ever, an author has put me off food. If nothing else, that's my clue that I should never read anything by this author again. She's liable to make me swear off bread or chocolate and THAT I couldn't stand.",120.0,1,106,846.94,7.99,1266,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3

The King indeed, is a master storyteller. 
 The setting was a rural town in Maine, during the peak of summer 1980. Back then, people communicate by landline telephones; ones service is traded for another's goods; life was simple. Yet in one twisted connivance of fate, tragedy can strike not once, not twice, but multiple times. All throughout their ordeal, I always thought that if Donna just had a mobile phone, things would've turned out differently; but of course there'd be no story. 
 As one can expect, Stephen King's prose combines multiple elements of effective story writing (whatever they are called) through the lives of his characters in his chosen town. All these conspire to weave a tale that one would want to hide away from the world just to relish it, and finish it without disturbance.",1.0,0,2600,7774.000000000001,2.99,26,3,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5

 Another man on the plane is Lee Denham, supposidly, a person who smuggled Chinese people into Australia. He's a former police officer who is supposed to have gotten his partner killed.

They think Georgia knows where he is and they torture her, cutting off her finger, in attempt to gain information. They want to bring Ming and his formula back to China. 
 Georgia is a fun character to read about. She knows no fear and gets into many predicuments, always managing to escape by the narrowest manner. However, after getting her finger cut off, she continued to fight as if nothing happened and this was difficult to believe.

And she can hardly believe her luck. Running with celebs, gaining VIP access to Manhattan's hottest spots and meeting 'everyone worth knowing' is a million miles away from her old banking job. Overnight, New York has become her sexy late-night play...",Fiction,Novice,2,10,13,11.5,11,3.39,497,1.0,"One of the worst books I've ever read. Stereotypical characters, dull plot consisted of superficial world building, with predictive and anticlimactic ending. The dialogues are unrealistic and immature. And don't even let me start on describing this pathetic excuse for a ""love story"" or spectacular failure of a love triangle. Everything is horrible about this book. 
 Girl quits banking job, because she has been unhappy, gets a job at a PR firm, finds herself to be a star of the tabloids, whining along the way, gets a crush on the guy from a security of some posh club, kisses the guy from security, everything blows up all over their heads, then the girl realizes she hates the backstabbing PR business. 
 The side characters are even more flat and unimpressive than the main character. They have even less personality than Bette, our protagonist. Yes, I'm looking at you Penelope, you were 8 years involved with the guy who'd rather spend every goddamn night of the week drinking with some unimportant acquaintances than with you. Good guys are as superficial and obnoxious as the bad guys. Uncle Will is a shameless gay stereotype and basically has no other trait than being gay. Though the author broke her spine over convincing us how Bette, our protagonist, adjusted to the world of PR, it was obvious she had no idea what the hell she was doing nor how to deal with the complications. I don't even know how she handled the Playboy party when she had been totally incompetent with the task. I admit, I read it only so I could criticize it. 
 In the end, Bette is in the same place she was at the beginning of the book. She has no prospective job, nor she knows who she wants to be in the next five years. She is shallow, self-centered and lifeless main character, who is supposedly fascinating enough for photographers to take her photos everywhere she goes, and tabloids to write bullshit about. I just don't comprehend why this girl can't speak her mind about ANYTHING OR STAND UP FOR HERSELF. But the most ridiculous part of this book was the fact that she went along with every little plan her new boss had for her - from ""dating"" a guy who's blatantly gay and whom she can't stand, to ditching her best friends and family, so she could go the parties because ""it's part of the job"". Oh, give me a break. She had no character development whatsoever, and she willingly agreed to wait three fucking months for a guy who'd go and become successful in his career, while she sits at home in her PJs and eats junk food. She doesn't respect herself and I don't see why anyone else should. 
 For a chick-lit, the romance is almost non-existent and anticlimactic. The central love story is platonic, theatrical and unrealistic to that extent that I wanted to puke. After one kiss and two 5-minute conversations, which weren't that deep, they decided they have a future together, even though there was no situation or conversation in which we'd see if they share same interests or if they're compatible together. Bette thinks Sammy is hot, Sammy thinks Bette is cute and that's their epic love.",36.0,1,4400,4356.0,0.99,1055,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1

Then, to her amazement, the ""coolest girl in the world"" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become TullyandKate. Inseparable.
So begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.
From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness.
Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend. . . .
For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,13,13,13.0,3,4.04,7,3.0,"In the early 1970's two unlikely girls, Tuly and Kate, are brought together in middle school and develop a friendship that spans three decades. As life takes the typical twists and turns, the friendship is tested. 
 This is a pretty formulaic story line filled with every stereotype you can imagine. While the characters were pretty one-dimensional and the storyline predictable, overall it was an enjoyable read. I think for me it was the right book at the right time. I started it on Mother's Day, which is always a bit of an emotional day, missing the major mother figures in my life. So a mindless, quick read was perfect. I also really appreciated Hannah weaving the signs for Inflammatory Breast Cancer into the story. It is important that women know it is not just about feeling for lumps, and Hannah brings this to light without overdoing it. If you came to age in the 70's and 80's you are likely to enjoy the nostalgic trip down memory lane through the pop-culture references. 
 I certainly would not recommend this for everyone. If you enjoy chick-lit and beach reads, this is probably a good read for you. If you are fortunate to have a best friend who has known you since childhood, especially if that friend is one of the few people who you know love you no matter your flaws, I think you feel a connection to Tuly and Kate. I know I did. If you enjoyed the movie Beaches, you will probably enjoy this book.",0.0,0,645,3218.55,4.99,171,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,4
461,First Sight,Danielle Steel,2013,2013,"NEW YORK TIMESBESTSELLER
Paris, L.A., and the world of ready to wear fashion provide rich backdrops for Danielle Steel's deeply involving story of a gifted designer whose talent and drive have brought her everything--except the ability to erase her past and trust relationships.
FIRST SIGHT 
New York. London. Milan. Paris. Fashion Week in all four cities. A month of endless interviews, parties, and unflagging work and attention to detail at the semiannual ready to wear fashion shows--the famous pret-a-porter. At the center of the storm and avalanche of work is American Timmie O'Neill, whose renowned line, Timmie O, is the embodiment of casual chic, in fashion and for the home. She has created a business that inspires, fills, and consumes her life.
With an unerring instinct for what the next trend will be, an innate genius for business, tireless labor, and sheer fearlessness, starting from nothing, over two decades Timmie has built an international empire that has brought her enormous satisfaction and success. In a world where humility and compassion are all too rare, her humor, kindness, integrity, and creativity are inspirational. Yet as blessed as she feels by her success, Timmie harbors the private wounds of a devastating childhood and past tragedy. She is too smart, too experienced, and too hurt to want much in her personal life beyond a succession of convenient, very limited relationships. Always willing to take risks in business, she never risks her heart.
But despite her well-ordered and highly controlled world, it turns out that Timmie O'Neill is not immune to magic when it strikes. And it strikes in Paris during Paris Fashion Week, when an intriguing Frenchman comes into her life when she gets sick. At first, Timmie and Jean-Charles Vernier are only patient and physician. They become confidants and friends, corresponding at a safe distance between Paris and Los Angeles once she goes home. There is every reason why they must remain apart. But neither can deny their growing friendship and the electricity that sparks whenever they meet.
First Sightis as complex and compelling as modern life itself. Careers, families, histories, losses, duty, obligation, and fear of losing control and getting hurt. It is a tale of daring to take risks, and losing control just enough to have a life, when the opportunity presents itself. When two very different worlds and strong-willed people collide, everything changes in an instant, as they confront the age-old question of whether to lay oneself bare and risk intimacy--or not. Are they brave enough to face what comes next? And will they do it together or apart?",Fiction,Intermediate,5,4,14,9.8,11,3.49,13,5.0,"it was a very good book as always, her book always have a story that some can relate to.

Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Walter and Patty Berglund as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.
(from the back cover)",Fiction,Intermediate,19,1,15,8.517241379310345,14,3.73,516,4.0,"It's always hard to review a complete brick of a book (literally speaking), and this one is quite something. 
 Franzen has almost entirely adhered to the simple point-and-tell way of God informing the reader of what happens throughout the book, interspersed with a few character perspective moments. 
 Walter and Patty Berglund are a smart, suburban, modern married couple who are in turmoil and seemingly cannot come to terms with this. They avoid each other rather, avoiding their issues apart from when they fight, which is like a cold, staged play, reminiscent of Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"" in some affects. 
 Franzen's main strengths are the storytelling, the parallel plots and treating the reader like an intelligent person. At the same time, the best bits of this book read way better than a very long episode of ""Desperate Housewives"", which it often reminded me of. At its worst, the book reminded me of a very long, outstretched and bloated episode of ""Desperate Housewives"". 
 Some might say this book pin-points the human condition of relationships in modern-day western civilisation, and I'll say it does to a certain extent. Franzen is very good at writing matter-of-factly when it comes to describing human emotions which I think works to his advantage: the reader is allowed to think for herself/himself and the characters of the book come out a lot differently than if Franzen would have applied sappy adjectives throughout. 
 All in all, this is a big book, and I think its flaws and brilliance is part of what it's all about: people's inner worlds, as felt inside and projected outside. Highly recommendable, masterfully written despite a few lows, ending up with being one of the best fictional books I've read in a few years.",0.0,0,860,6871.400000000001,7.99,128,2,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,4

 SWEDISH REVIEW 
 Om det ar nagot Mo Hayder kan sa ar det att skriva bocker som gar under skinnet pa en. Precis som Dennis Lehane sa vagar hon ta ut svangarna och det ar med isande fasa man laser varje sida. 
 Forsvunnen ar inget undantag. Att lasa om kidnappade barn ar hemskt och man vet inte om Jack Caffery kommer att lyckas radda situationen. Caffery ar en lysande polis, men i denna bok sa verkar det som om kidnapparen kan forutse polisen nasta drag och ju mer tiden gar desto mer lutar det at att det ar forsent, att flickan inte kommer att raddas. 
 Sedan har vi polisdykaren Flea Marley, som lever med konsekvenserna fran foregaende bok, vilket stor henne i jobbet. Hon vet inte om att Jack misstanker henne for ett brott som hon faktiskt ar oskyldig till men som i och med det Jack vet om det ter sig logiskt att han misstanker henne. Nu ger hon sig in kampen for att radda den kidnappade flickan. Men ar hon verkligen i form att ta sig an fallet? Kommer hon istallet bara att riskera sitt eget liv? 
 Forsvunnen ar en ruggig thriller dar den okande forovaren hela tiden lurar i bakgrunden och man sitter pa helspand pa slutet nar Caffery konfronterar forovaren. Fragan ar kommer allting att sluta lyckligt?

 ENGLISH REVIEW 
 If there is one thing Mo Hayder knows is it to write a book that crawls under your skin. She dares, just like Dennis Lehane can she write in such a way that it's with terror you turn each page. 
 Gone is no exception. Reading about kidnapped children is always terrible and you do not know if Jack Caffery will be able to save the kidnapped girl. Caffery is a brilliant police, but in this book, the kidnapper seems to anticipate every single move the police do, and as more time goes by, the fear grows that they will be too late. 
 Then we have police diver Flea Marley, who lives with the consequences from the previous book, which has consequences for her at work. She does not know that Jack suspects her for a crime she's actually innocent of. Although it's quite logical that he suspects her since he doesn't have the whole picture. Now she decides to search for the kidnapped girl. But, is she really in shape to help out? Or will she only risk her own life? 
 Gone is a tough thriller where the unidentified perpetrator always lurks in the background, and at the end, when Caffery confronts the perpetrator will you still question if everything will end happily...

The year is 2008 and Samantha Kofer's career at a huge Wall Street law firm is on the fast track--until the recession hits and she gets downsized, furloughed, escorted out of the building. Samantha, though, is one of the ""lucky"" associates. She's offered an opportunity to work at a legal aid clinic for one year without pay, after which there would be a slim chance that she'd get her old job back.
In a matter of days Samantha moves from Manhattan to Brady, Virginia, population 2,200, in the heart of Appalachia, a part of the world she has only read about. Mattie Wyatt, lifelong Brady resident and head of the town's legal aid clinic, is there to teach her how to ""help real people with real problems."" For the first time in her career, Samantha prepares a lawsuit, sees the inside of an actual courtroom, gets scolded by a judge, and receives threats from locals who aren't so thrilled to have a big-city lawyer in town. And she learns that Brady, like most small towns, harbors some big secrets.
Her new job takes Samantha into the murky and dangerous world of coal mining, where laws are often broken, rules are ignored, regulations are flouted, communities are divided, and the land itself is under attack from Big Coal.

371,Loving Frank,Nancy Horan,2007,2007,"I have been standing on the side of life, watching it float by. I want to swim in the river. I want to feel the current.
So writes Mamah Borthwick Cheney in her diary as she struggles to justify her clandestine love affair with Frank Lloyd Wright. Four years earlier, in 1903, Mamah and her husband, Edwin, had commissioned the renowned architect to design a new home for them. During the construction of the house, a powerful attraction developed between Mamah and Frank, and in time the lovers, each married with children, embarked on a course that would shock Chicago society and forever change their lives.
In this groundbreaking historical novel, fact and fiction blend together brilliantly. While scholars have largely relegated Mamah to a footnote in the life of America's greatest architect, author Nancy Horan gives full weight to their dramatic love story and illuminates Mamah's profound influence on Wright.
Drawing on years of research, Horan weaves little-known facts into a compelling narrative, vividly portraying the conflicts and struggles of a woman forced to choose between the roles of mother, wife, lover, and intellectual. Horan's Mamah is a woman seeking to find her own place, her own creative calling in the world, and her unforgettable journey, marked by choices that reshape her notions of love and responsibility, leads inexorably to this novel's stunning conclusion.",Fiction,Intermediate,5,5,15,11.0,6,3.74,126,3.0,"This is the story of Mamah Borthwick, the love of Frank Lloyd Wright. 
 I struggled through a lot of this book, not because it wasn't well written but because I didn't like Mamah. 
 I found her character frustrating and both she and Frank self-centered. So although I enjoyed the writing I did not love the story. This has less to do with the author and more to do with the characters which are not actually fictional. I'm on the fence about how to rate a story like this. 
 I think people who like A Paris Wife would also like Loving Frank

 I definitely identified with the drive to make a difference or fulfill one's dreams but I could not shake the fact that SHE LEFT HER CHILDREN. For 2 years she didn't see them and I don't care how much she missed them. Ugh, it was so frustrating. She was self-centered just leaving her children to be raised by her poor sister and husband. Her children deserved a better mother. 
 Frank was egotistical and crazy and a genius and none of this surprised me although I can't see how a woman would want to deal with the public scorn and loss of family to be with him. Of course, I can't think of any reason to walk out on my child. 
 The end completely took me by surprise. Completely. I'm still shocked and had to search the internet to confirm the tragedy. How had I never heard about this before? It's so senseless.

Gaskell expertly blends individual feeling with social concern, and her heroine, Margaret Hale, is one of the most original creations of Victorian literature.
When Margaret Hale's father leaves the Church in a crisis of conscience she is forced to leave her comfortable home in the tranquil countryside of Hampshire and move with her family to the fictional industrial town of Milton in the north of England. Though at first disgusted by her new surroundings, she witnesses the brutality wrought by the Industrial Revolution and becomes aware of the poverty and suffering of the local mill workers. Sympathetic to the poor she makes friends among them and develops a fervent sense of social justice. She clashes with the mill-owner and self-made man, John Thornton, who is contemptuous of his workers. However, their fierce opposition masks a deeper attraction.
Gaskell based her depiction of Milton on Manchester, where she lived as the wife of a Unitarian minister. She was an accomplished writer, much of her work published in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words including North and South which was originally published as a serial.

This cloud is self-sustaining and self-reproducing. It is intelligent and learns from experience. For all practical purposes, it is alive.
It has been programmed as a predator. It is evolving swiftly, becoming more deadly with each passing hour.
Every attempt to destroy it has failed.
And we are the prey.",Fiction,Intermediate,1,5,15,5.9375,14,3.72,133370,4.0,"This is my first Michael Crichton read, and I loved it. Prey is told in first person by Jack Foreman, a stay-at-home dad, who suspects his wife, Julia, of having an affair. Julia, a vice president at Xymos, a molecular manufacturing company, works late night, and one night she doesn't even come home at all. Eventually, Julia shows Jack a video demonstration of what they're working on - a cloud of nanoparticles, which works as one big camera. Then something goes wrong at the facility and Jack is invited by Ricky, his former employee to come and help fix the problem. A cloud of nanoparticles -- micro-robots -- has escaped from the laboratory, and he has to get it back. But this cloud is self-reproducing, intelligent; it evolves quickly, and is now a threat. There at the facility Jack learns the truth about his wife, the nanoparticles, and his former co-workers. 
 The book has a slow start. Jacks suspects his wife of having an affair and he's taking time on deciding what to do because he isn't very sure yet. He doesn't want a divorce; he wants to keep his family together, and his kids, always biting each other, are not helping matters. He can't get a job; he's rejected wherever he applies because of a 'got fired for doing the right thing' incident in his former workplace. 
 And then the story kicks off when he's asked to come and solve a problem at the plant. Then comes the action, the suspense, and of course the thrill. You wouldn't want to be anywhere near the swarms - those molecular robots. They're dangerous, they hurt the skin, and they can get into your nasal cavity, suffocating you. They kill wildlife as well as humans. Jack has to stop it, no matter what. Because he designed the program used in modeling the swarms. But he can't do it himself. There are other notable characters there like the quiet, strong and beautiful Mae; devious Ricky; loud-farting/non-stop talking Charley; and of course Jack's beautiful and secretive wife, Julia. Some of these characters help to achieve the goal, while others stand in Jack's way. There are lots of deaths in the end. 
 I loved the technological and biological details the author wove in the various part of the story. It's blended well into the narrative and doesn't cause any distraction. Even though I found some of them boring or overly done, I still learnt something from them. 
 The five-paged bibliography at the end of the book shows well the thorough research undertaken by the author for this book. It is a book worth reading, and I'll certainly read more titles from Crichton. I have my mind on Jurassic Park next. Although I've seen the movie, I'd still love to experience the book side of it. 
 I recommend this book to any sci-fi and techno-thriller lover. If you like the science-goes-wrong genre, then this is the book for you.

It's just too crazy to fathom, but I can see how this could happen to people. I could see how some things could push people right over the edge. And it's not a nice edge to go over. 
 Awesome book!

1041,Sing You Home,Jodi Picoult,2011,2011,"One miscarriage too many spelled the end of Max and Zoe Baxter's marriage. Though the former couple went quite separate ways, their fates remained entangled: After veering into alcoholism, Max is saved in multiple senses by his fundamentalist conversion; Zoe, for her part, finds healing relief in music therapy and the friendship, then romantic love with Vanessa, her counselor. After Zoe and Vanessa, now married, decide to have a baby, they realize that they must join battle with Max, who objects on both religious and financial grounds.

 There are so many things I wish I could say coherently about this book. I was at a loss of words when I finished it three hours ago, and I still am speechless. But I want to write this review while the emotions it evoked are still at their strongest. 
 The writing was superb as always. Picoult doesn't use a lot of ""SAT"" vocabulary, or extremely complex sentence structure, but the way she engages readers with detail and finesse is extraordinary. I am always tempted to read just a single page more, then just one chapter more, until I've gone through the entire 400+ page book. I even forgot to put this on my to-read shelf on Goodreads. 
 Picoult's characters are splendid - by the middle of the book I was immersed in Zoe's yearning for children and Max's difficulty with alcohol abuse, and I felt like they were real, breathing people. Vanessa's no-nonsense attitude I admired, and side characters like Dara and Lucy I came to love as well. 
 The element that really made me appreciate this novel was Picoult's take on gay marriage, and homosexual inequality in contemporary society. I cannot adequately state how inspiring this book was to me in that regard. Here is one of the many powerful quotes that I had to stop and re-read (I even put this in my favorite quotes section on Facebook)... 
 ""I remember my mother telling me that, when she was a little girl in Catholic school, the nuns used to hit her left hand every time she wrote with it. Nowadays, if a teacher did that, she'd probably be arrested for child abuse. The optimist in me wants to believe sexuality will eventually become like handwriting: there's no right way or wrong way to do it. We're all just wired differently. 
 It's also worth nothing that, when you meet someone, you never bother to ask if he's right- or left- handed. 
 After all: Does it really matter to anyone other than the person holding the pen?"" 
 Beautiful.

I never could have expected a story so involving and complex. The characters come to life on the pages, and the storyline is brilliant in its everyday commonness. 
 Summer Sisters follows the lives of Caitlyn Somers and Victoria Leonard, two unlikely girls from different social backgrounds. Caitlin invites Victoria to stay the summer with her and her father who lives in Martha's Vineyard; shy Victoria can't imagine why a girl so glamorous as Caitlin would want to be friend someone as boring as herself. The two of them form a complex friendship of love and rivalry that spans from the 1970s to the 1990s. 
 These girls share moments of soaring loyalty and heartbreaking betrayal, and I was glued from the very first page. The settings are so real, part of them I could have plucked from my own childhood. This is a truly wonderful book for anyone who loves reading epics, or stories of friendship that takes place in times of joy and times of tragedy.

956,The Age Of Miracles,Karen Thompson Walker,2012,2012,"""It still amazes me how little we really knew. . . . Maybe everything that happened to me and my family had nothing at all to do with the slowing. It's possible, I guess. But I doubt it. I doubt it very much.""
Luminous, haunting, unforgettable, The Age of Miraclesis a stunning fiction debut by a superb new writer, a story about coming of age during extraordinary times, about people going on with their lives in an era of profound uncertainty.
On a seemingly ordinary Saturday in a California suburb, 11-year-old Julia and her family awake to discover, along with the rest of the world, that the rotation of the earth has suddenly begun to slow. The days and nights grow longer and longer, gravity is affected, the environment is thrown into disarray. Yet as she struggles to navigate an ever-shifting landscape, Julia is also coping with the normal disasters of everyday life--the fissures in her parents' marriage, the loss of old friends, the hopeful anguish of first love, the bizarre behavior of her grandfather who, convinced of a government conspiracy, spends his days obsessively cataloging his possessions. As Julia adjusts to the new normal, the slowing inexorably continues.
With spare, graceful prose and the emotional wisdom of a born storyteller, Karen Thompson Walker has created a singular narrator in Julia, a resilient and insightful young girl, and a moving portrait of family life set against the backdrop of an utterly altered world.",Fiction,Intermediate,2,6,10,8.0,1,3.64,61891,5.0,"I loved this book. I read it in one 24 hour period. Great example of soft sci-fi/fabulist fiction. It's like a cross between Alice Sebold's book The Lovely Bones and Lars Van Trier's film Melancholia. In some ways, I also thought about Diary of Anne Frank. A young girl faces a possible apocalypse in MIRACLES. It's YA dystopia but more charming and whimsical than, say, The Hunger Games. Ultimately it is a book that celebrates life with one hand, as it erases life with the other. 
 The language of the book is poetic and intoxicating. The consequences of the slowing earth are imagined in rich and provocative detail. 
 SPOILER ALERT. 
 I did think the author cheated just a bit here and there. It's a brilliant cheat. There are times the hero Julia says things like: ""That was the last time I EVER ate strawberries."" Or I NEVER saw so and so again. That kind of language hints that she might die at the end, or that the world ends in the last chapter. In fact, the character and the world still go on by the novel's end, albeit precariously. I think the more honest phrasing would have been: ""That was the last time I ate strawberries this spring."" Because as long as the earth spins and she is alive, she can't truly know that she will NEVER eat strawberries again. Even if strawberries become extinct, technically she can not know that by some twist of fate she won't eat them again. 
 It's a small thing and I think the author was very clever to use this sleight of hand. It made me think that the girl or the world were going away. It's a book I will think of for some time. As a writer myself of speculative, trippy fiction -- I am in the process of analyzing the many things this book did right!

1844,The Bluest Eye,Toni Morrison,2000,2005,"The Bluest Eyeis Toni Morrison's first novel, a book heralded for its richness of language and boldness of vision. Set in the author's girlhood hometown of Lorain, Ohio, it tells the story of black, eleven-year-old Pecola Breedlove. Pecola prays for her eyes to turn blue so that she will be as beautiful and beloved as all the blond, blue-eyed children in America. In the autumn of 1941, the year the marigolds in the Breedloves' garden do not bloom. Pecola's life does change- in painful, devastating ways.
What its vivid evocation of the fear and loneliness at the heart of a child's yearning, and the tragedy of its fulfillment. The Bluest Eyeremains one of Tony Morrisons's most powerful, unforgettable novels- and a significant work of American fiction.",Fiction,Intermediate,11,3,13,7.818181818181818,11,3.99,111515,5.0,"...his mother did not like him to play with niggers. She had explained to him the difference between colored people and niggers. They were easily identifiable. Colored people were neat and quiet; niggers were dirty and loud...The line between colored and nigger was not always clear; subtle and telltale signs threatened to erode it, and the watch had to be constant. 
 While I was not the biggest fan of Morrison's style in this novel, I did fully appreciate the dagger-sharp insight that she brought to the color caste system that is so prevalent in African-American culture, even today. Her dialogue rang so true, I could hear it coming directly out of my mother's mouth, my grandmother's mouth, and those of all of the women who've ever filled our kitchens with raucous communal fun and glum communal tragedy alike. Her use of the Dick & Jane children's books, used for decades to teach children to read (SEEMOTHERMOTHERISVERYNICEMOTHERWILLYOUPLAYWITHJANEMOTHERLAUGHSLAUGHMOTHERLAUGHLA) created a chilling, ironic and staggering contrast between the lives of the whites and those of the blacks in this novel. Shirley Temple, Mary Jane candies, and Jean Harlow hairstyles - you'll find the delicacy of all of them here, both in these characters' reality and in metaphor. While the truth and injustices here were often sobering to read, they were filled with too much truth to rightfully deny or turn away from. 
 I could spend hours discussing this novel. I could quote from it all day, but I won't do that, because the entire read was poignant and so crisply aware of the color line - the how and the why - that there is no one point that can overshadow another in the message that these words aimed to send. This novel is older than I am, and yet it still rings with such verity, with such biting truth and reality. With The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison cut open the existence of both internalized and externalized racism in America and laid it bare and exposed at our feet. For that, she deserves nothing but reverence and applause, so she will always have that from me. 
 Anyone who's ever been in doubt of a color line in Black America should read this book. Anyone who's ever questioned, ""But why can't I say those words when you say them all the time? But why do you still believe that racism exists? Why can't you just get over it - the past is the past?"" should read this book.

It's the early 1980s--the country is in a deep recession, and life after college is harder than ever. In the cafes on College Hill, the wised-up kids are inhaling Derrida and listening to Talking Heads. But Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English major, is writing her senior thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot, purveyors of the marriage plot that lies at the heart of the greatest English novels.
As Madeleine tries to understand why ""it became laughable to read writers like Cheever and Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about deflowering virgins in eighteenth-century France,"" real life, in the form of two very different guys, intervenes. Leonard Bankhead--charismatic loner, college Darwinist, and lost Portland boy--suddenly turns up in a semiotics seminar, and soon Madeleine finds herself in a highly charged erotic and intellectual relationship with him. At the same time, her old ""friend"" Mitchell Grammaticus--who's been reading Christian mysticism and generally acting strange--resurfaces, obsessed with the idea that Madeleine is destined to be his mate.
Over the next year, as the members of the triangle in this amazing, spellbinding novel graduate from college and enter the real world, events force them to reevaluate everything they learned in school. Leonard and Madeleine move to a biology Laboratory on Cape Cod, but can't escape the secret responsible for Leonard's seemingly inexhaustible energy and plunging moods. And Mitchell, traveling around the world to get Madeleine out of his mind, finds himself face-to-face with ultimate questions about the meaning of life, the existence of God, and the true nature of love.
Are the great love stories of the nineteenth century dead? Or can there be a new story, written for today and alive to the realities of feminism, sexual freedom, prenups, and divorce? With devastating wit and an abiding understanding of and affection for his characters, Jeffrey Eugenides revives the motivating energies of the Novel, while creating a story so contemporary and fresh that it reads like the intimate journal of our own lives.",Fiction,Novice,8,2,15,9.375,13,3.43,87,3.0,"BookFiendUSA: So, how was it? My GR friends' reviews are all over the place on this one. How does it compare to Virgin Suicides or Middlesex? 
 SandyBanks1971: It's...OK. Not badly written at all, but nothing incredible either. I can't compare it with Eugenides' earlier works, as I have never read anything by him before. 
 BookFiendUSA: Seriously? You've never even seen the Sofia Coppola movie? 
 SandyBanks1971: Nope. But I've read the synopses of the earlier books, and I can tell you that there are absolutely no virgins, suicides or hermaphrodites in this one. Instead, we get a manic-depressive, a wannabe Christian and an English major. 
 BookFiendUSA: No hermaphrodites? 
 SandyBanks1971: No. But there is a Marriage Plot. 
 BookFiendUSA: Explain. 
 SandyBanks1971: It's a common plot in 18th and 19th century literature. Typically, there is this girl --- the heroine --- and she has to choose between different suitors, and there will be all sorts of hijinks (pride, prejudices, misunderstandings, madwomen in the attic, etc.) before the nuptial payoff. Austen, Eliot and the Brontes used it extensively in their books. 
 BookFiendUSA: It's a romcom! 
 SandyBanks1971: Something like that. The heroine in this book, Madeline, is an English major (""English was what people who didn't know what to major in majored in."") who is steeped in these books and has to choose between Leonard, the brooding, brilliant manic depressive, and Mitchell, the earnest, spiritually inclined sensitive guy. I looked forward to how Eugenides is going to use this sort of plot in a modern setting and how he is going to resolve it. As one of Madeline's professor muses, ""What would it matter whom Emma married if she could file for separation later?"" ""How would Isabel Archer's marriage to Gilbert Osmond have been affected by the existence of a prenup? ... Where could you find the marriage plot nowadays?"" I'm also curious about whether the central romantic triangle is based on any particular 19th century novel (Franzen recently did this in Freedom). 
 BookFiendUSA: So ---? 
 SandyBanks1971: Eugenides does use the marriage plot, but the ending is a sort of a deconstruction of its traditional form. After all, in an age of gender equality and easy divorces, how could the Marriage Plot still matter? Leonard is obviously the Heathcliff type, and Mitchell is maybe a mix between Linton and St. John Rivers. Madeline is --- actually I don't quite know who she really is, especially compared to the male protagonists. Eugenides gives her a pretty extensive biography, and an intermittent ambition to go to grad school and write for literary reviews, but other than that, she seems to be merely a flimsy foil for her suitors. Early on, we are told that she loves Austen and James, but unlike Mitchell and Leonard, whose lives are transformed by the books that they read, there seems to be hardly any connection between her and those books. In a pivotal moment, she reflects on...Madeline. Yes, this Madeline, the little convent schoolgirl from Paris. 
 Leonard ruminates on Nietzche and Mitchell has his Thomas Merton inspired epiphanies, and Madeline thinks deeply about Madeline? Why can't she reflect on Wuthering Heights? Or, I dunno, Middlemarch? Or Persuasion? We never learn about what Madeline really thinks of the marriage plot --- and the obvious parallels to her private life --- either (her thesis is, after all, titled: ""I Thought You'd Never Ask: Some Thoughts on the Marriage Plot""). If The Marriage Plot is meant to be a modern reworking of an Austen or Bronte novel, this lack of development of her character is big minus. 
 BookFiendUSA: Okay, so the major female character is lame. I get it. I'd rather read a ton of Madeline books than a Henry James, though. Now, some people think that this novel is terribly pretentious, with its Ivy League setting, WASP characters and lengthy Barthes quotations. Do you agree? 
 SandyBanks1971: Not necessarily. I mean, he's writing about life in an Ivy League campus --- is there going to be an egghead or two, trust-fund babies, and academic egotists on steroid? You bet. To be fair, some of the kids are wealthy WASP types, but Leonard needs financial aid, and Mitchell is Greek and strictly middle class. There's lots of name-dropping, but in most cases, they're followed by sufficient exposition. The quotes are necessary to understand the characters' mindset, as they live in books as much as in the real world. And Eugenides is actually poking fun, wryly, at some of the faddish academic theories: 
 ""Madeline had a feeling that most semiotic theorists had been unpopular as children, often bullied or overlooked, and so had directed their lingering rage onto literature. They wanted to demote the author. They wanted a book, that hard-won, transcendent thing to be a text, contingent, indeterminate, and open for suggestions. They wanted the reader to be the main thing. Because they were readers."" 
 BookFiendUSA: Anything else that you like? 
 SandyBanks1971: I like how he writes about being in your early twenties, just out of college with your whole life stretching ahead of you. Grappling with issues, intellectual or otherwise. How everything seems to be of looming importance. How stuff happens, sometimes casually, that determine how you life the rest of your life. I think he captures that well, and can be quite eloquent about it. So I guess I'll check out the suicides and hermaphrodites.",30.0,1,5697,29168.64,5.12,427,4,4,4,1,2,2,3,5,5

 This time paeodophiles are being brutally murdered and no obvious reasoning is forthcoming. Kerrigan and the team are put onto the case and soon enough the bodies start piling up. About halfway through the book the storyline takes on a different turn sending the whole thing into a different direction. It was cleverly done and not an obvious route to follow. I enjoyed the book for the most part but did think some parts of the book were stretched out a little. Too much detail at times that wasn't really necessary and I would actually prefer shorter chapters to keep the flow and momentum going. Occasionally I would wonder into 'when is this chapter finishing?' territory as chapters would sometimes drag on. The second half of the book really picks up pace and this is where it really held my attention and I didn't want to put the book down until the end. 
 Maeve Kerrigan herself is a likeable character albeit her decisions at times leaves the head shaking. She isn't perfect my any means, quick tempered and could do with thinking before acting rationally but she has a flair for the job and is growing on me as her character develops through the books.

For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate.
Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone.
During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love.

But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love.

Why, of all the children was Kyle the one?"" 
 I first read THE RESCUE in 2002 and enjoyed it just as much this time with it's rediscovery. As soon as I opened the first page I was lost, reading continuously for the next 24 hours. Thinking to myself, damn that Nicholas Sparks' he's done it again, sucking me right back into one of the best love stories I've ever read. 
 Due to a horrific childhood trauma volunteer firefighter Taylor McAden is driven to take disturbing heroic risks while on the job, trying to somehow put his world right. He has few friends and all of his past relationships have resulted from rescuing troubled women in one way or another. All of whom he inevitably leaves as soon as they want more from him then he can give. It seems that there's just one leap Taylor can't make; that of allowing himself to fall in love. 
 Denise Holden is a single mother of a handicapped child. Due to a lack of finances she has been forced to move back to her mother's hometown and live in the inherited home. At the moment she's barely scraping by, her son Kyle taking up most of her time, energy and resources. Love is the last thing on Denise's mind as she drives home from her job at the local diner. As fate would have it though a terrible storm hit's the small southern town that night, contriving to bring our couple together. As the storm rages Denise crashes her car and upon regaining consciousness finds herself staring into the handsome face of risk taker extraordinaire Taylor. Before she can acknowledge him as her potential life partner though panic takes over as she realizes that her son is no longer in the car and is feared to be lost in the nearby swamp. 
 I won't be giving anything away by telling you that Taylor rescues both Denise and her son and together they forge into a relationship. But as wonderful as the relationship seems in the beginning it doesn't take long for the cracks to show and the harder Denise tries to help Taylor the more he pulls away. Shutting down emotionally and taking greater and greater risks with the fire department(For a small town they sure have a lot of fires.) 
 As with every Nicholas Sparks' novel we are never guaranteed a HEA which aids in a degree of tension throughout this story. For me the relationship and its sudden decline is so well written that it seemed a page from my own past, tugging at my heart with its familiarity. Taylor is a mystery throughout and the whys of this aren't revealed until the very end. THE RESCUE contains some fabulous secondary characters and you will fall in love with every one of them. It's also full of action, suspense and melodrama. There were a couple of moments when I actually gasped out loud, unbelieving as to what I'd just read. Have some Kleenex handy, this is great yet as always with Sparks bittersweet love story. Cheers!",23.0,1,2866,8569.34,2.99,22,3,3,4,3,2,3,5,5,5
1733,The Shell Seekers,Rosamunde Pilcher,1988,1987,"Set in London and Cornwall from World War II to the present, Rosamunde Pilcher tells the story of the Keeling family, and of the passions and heartbreak that have held them together for three generations. The family centers around Penelope, and it is her love, courage, and sense of values that determine the course of all their lives,
One of Penelope's most treasured possessions is The Shell Seekers, which her father painted and left her as a remembrance and a legacy. It is this painting that symbolizes to Penelope the ties between the generations. It is the link between the past, the present, and the future. But it is the fate of this painting that just may tear the family apart....
Rosamunde Pilcher's writing demonstrates a deep sensitivity to human frailties, desires, and joys. She weaves a story that bursts with emotion, so involving it is impossible to put down. The world she creates and opens up to you becomes a place you feel comfortable, a place you can't wait to return to, a place you will never forget.",Fiction,Excellent,47,6,15,10.340425531914894,11,4.13,219,5.0,"""The most ordinary of prospects caused her to stop and stare. The last of the leaves dropped from the trees, and the bare branches made lace against pale skies. Sun after rain turned cobbled streets blue as fish scales, dazzling to the eye. Autumn winds, whipping the bay to a scud of white-caps, brought with them, not cold, but a surging sense of vitality..."" 
 Penelope Keeling knows how to live life to the fullest and I absolutely adore her! She grasps those things that matter most in life - the comfort of a home, the security of a loving mother, the laughter of friends and family, the feel of soil and the beauty of the outdoors, the enticing smells of home-cooked meals, and the allure of a splendid painting. When I come across a character in one of my books that touches me and makes me want to re-examine my own life, then I know I have found a gem. 
 Of course, we're all familiar with the phrase ""don't judge a book by its cover"". Unfortunately, I have been guilty of that offense in the past and no less so with this book. I have seen Rosamunde Pilcher's novels in bookstores and libraries and have admittedly walked right on by due to their overly feminine and botanic covers. I didn't think they were ""my sort of book"". However, I decided to give this one a try when I discovered some trusted Goodreads friends were reading this. Well, thank goodness I did - such a true delight! At the outset, we learn that Penelope is a sixty-four-year old widow that has had a surprise glimpse at her own mortality. We are introduced to her three adult children - Nancy, Olivia and Noel - as well as others that have touched her life at some point or another - her treasured mother and father, an ill-suited husband, a loyal friend, a devoted lover, a grieving young woman and a secretive yet trustworthy gardener. Each character is drawn with such depth and clarity that I felt I really knew each and every one of them. The title of this novel, The Shell Seekers, derives from a painting given to Penelope by her father, the prominent artist Lawrence Stern. When the now deceased Lawrence Stern's works of art become much sought-after, the value of this and other pieces increases significantly. Each of Penelope's children have their own thoughts about what should be done with this and other works in their mother's possession. What they desire reveals to us much about each of them, their innermost substance. As with real people, what we see is not all pretty. Pilcher has the gift of depicting riveting family dynamics. ""Family rows are like car accidents. Every family thinks, 'It couldn't happen to us,' but it can happen to everybody. The only way to avoid them is to drive with the greatest care and have much consideration for others."" 
 Penelope makes a journey to Cornwall, both in spirit and literally, where she sweeps us along to revel in the landscape and her own cherished memories. I loved every minute of this visit and will miss my time spent with Penelope. Heart-warming, memorable, and a bit of a tear-jerker, The Shell Seekers is a treasure I won't soon forget. I am quite pleased that several more Rosamunde Pilcher novels now grace my bookshelf with their blossoming covers and their promise of comfort and pure reading satisfaction.",135.0,1,35424,176765.76,4.99,811,4,4,5,3,3,3,5,5,5

When the spirit of Lara's great-aunt Sadie-a feisty, demanding girl with firm ideas about fashion, love, and the right way to dance-mysteriously appears, she has one request: Lara must find a missing necklace that had been in Sadie's possession for more than seventy-five years, because Sadie cannot rest without it.
Lara and Sadie make a hilarious sparring duo, and at first it seems as though they have nothing in common. But as the mission to find Sadie's necklace leads to intrigue and a new romance for Lara, these very different ""twenties"" girls learn some surprising truths from and about each other.

 Although there was a good romance in this book, it wasn't the main focus of the book. Instead, this novel put most of it's emphasis on family and friendship and I really liked that! Sadie definitely got on my nerves a lot, mostly because I was listening to this as an audio book and the narrator made her voice especially annoying while saying her lines. However, she had a surprising amount of character development keeping in mind that she was the GHOST of a 105 year old woman. I really enjoyed how this was a mystery as well, there was so much going on that you almost forgot about one part of the story when it showed up again! The one critique I have, though, is how long this book was. I felt like there were too many dead ends while trying to find that one necklace and it was starting to get a little repetitive. I think it could have wrapped up a little quicker, but it still was a fun read!",156.0,1,415,2070.85,4.99,251,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,5,5

 Somehow I've managed to live over five and a half dog years without ever reading a Dean Koontz novel. However, when I was presented with the opportunity to do a buddy read with . . . 
 I jumped at the chance. What do I have to say now that I'm finished????? 
 I mean LOTS better because I really had a pretty horrible time while reading this one. In case you too have spent decades ignoring Koontz, here's the lowdown of what Watchers is about. We start with Travis, a supposed former Delta Force member who must have suffered some severe head trauma or something that made him no longer be awesome. Then we meet Bella Swan Nora. Poor Nora is a special snowflake who was forced to live as a recluse by her crazy ass aunt. Now that evil Aunty has finally kicked the bucket, Nora can let her freak flag fly. Ha! Not really. Nora can pretty much only drone on and on and on and on about how difficult things were for her while Travis tells her how much she is smart, she is kind and she is important. (I would like it to be on the record that I will gladly volunteer as tribute to deliver the bitchslapping to Nora that she sooooooo deserves.) Finally, we get to meet the star of the show - a/k/a the smartest pooch ever grown in a lab. No offense el doggito, but there can only be one Einstein . . . 
 Anywho, the whole story is about how Travis finds supermutt and then finds Nora and they fall into instalovey loveytimes and discover that Einstein is a real Einstein all while trying to keep it on the downlow that they have the dog everyone and their . . well dog is looking for while trying to avoid an abomination that was also created by the government known as ""The Outsider"" and not to mention not get whacked by a mafia hitman. You'd think with all that going on this would've been interesting, huh? Well, you'd be wrong 'cause it was boring as shit. . . . 
 Basically this was eleventy trillion pages of a lesson on man's inhumanity to man written by a dude who seriously has a thing for dogs. Like so much that I'm pretty sure he's one of the people all the right-wing nutters were thinking about wanting to marry his pet when they were trying to keep gay marriage illegal. 
 Save your breath if you want to troll me. One thing I know for certain is . . . 
 Just ask Edward. Okay, maybe not him. Ask Shelby instead. I'd tell you to ask Delee but her interwebs is broke, Ron 2.0 disagrees with me 100% of the time out of spite and it will be October before he gets a review posted anyway, and Stepheny is on like Chapter 1 still so she doesn't even know the snoozefest she's about to subject herself to.",81.0,1,351,1049.49,2.99,289,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,4

Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status ""darkeyes."" Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.
The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin's master has much deeper motives.
Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.
Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable.
