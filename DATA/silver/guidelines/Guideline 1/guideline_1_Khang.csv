0,Death Comes To Pemberley,P. D. James,2011,2013,"The world is classic Jane Austen. The mystery is vintage P.D. James.
The year is 1803, and Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet have been married for six years. There are now two handsome and healthy sons in the nursery, Elizabeth's beloved sister Jane and her husband Bingley live nearby and the orderly world of Pemberley seems unassailable. But all this is threatened when, on the eve of the annual autumn ball, the guests are preparing to retire for the night when a chaise appears, rocking down the path from Pemberley's wild woodland. As it pulls up, Lydia Wickham - Elizabeth Bennet's younger, unreliable sister - stumbles out screaming that her husband has been murdered.
Two great literary minds - master of suspense P.D. James and literary icon Jane Austen - come together in Death Comes to Pemberley, a bestselling historical crime fiction tribute to Pride and Prejudice. Conjuring the world of Elizabeth Bennet and Mark Darcy and combining the trappings of Regency British society with a classic murder mystery, James creates a delightful mash-up that will intrigue any Janeite.
From the bestselling author of The Murder Room, Children of Men and A Certain Justice, comes a wonderful mixture of the nation's greatest romance and best-loved crime fiction. In 2013, this novel was adapted as a miniseries by the BBC, starring Matthew Rhys as Darcy, Anna Maxwell Martin as Elizabeth Bennet and Jenna Coleman as Lydia Wickham.",Fiction,Novice,13,3,12,5.615384615384615,1,3.21,969,2.0,"Very meh.

1,Haunted,Chuck Palahniuk,2005,2006,"Haunted is a novel made up of stories: twenty-three of the most horrifying, hilarious, mind-blowing, stomach-churning tales you'll ever encounter.
The stories are told by people who have all answered an ad headlined 'Artists Retreat: Abandon your life for three months'. They are led to believe that here they will leave behind all the distractions of 'real life' that are keeping them from creating the masterpiece that is in them.
But 'here' turns out to be a cavernous and ornate old theater where they are utterly isolated from the outside world - and where heat and power and, most importantly, food are in increasingly short supply. And the more desperate the circumstances become, the more desperate the stories they tell - and the more devious their machinations to make themselves the hero of the inevitable play/movie/non-fiction blockbuster that will certainly be made from their plight.",Fiction,Intermediate,6,8,13,9.416666666666666,13,3.59,69794,0.0,"I ended up skipping the majority of the narrative sections from about page 100 onwards, but mostly they were relatively short so I probably only skipped 70 pages or so.

2,Cell,Stephen King,2006,2006,"There is a reason cell rhymes with hell.
On October 1, God is in His heaven, the stock market stands at 10,140, most of the planes are on time, and Clayton Riddell, an artist from Maine, is almost bouncing up Boylston Street in Boston. He's just landed a comic book deal that might finally enable him to support his family by making art instead of teaching it. He's already picked up a small (but expensive!) gift for his long-suffering wife, and he knows just what he will get for his boy Johnny. Why not a little treat for himself? Clay is feeling good about the future.
That changes in a hurry. The cause of the devastation is a phenomenon that will come to be known as The Pulse, and the delivery method is a cell phone. Everyone's cell phone. Clay and the few desperate survivors who join him suddenly find themselves in the pitch-black night of civilization's darkest age, surrounded by chaos, carnage, and a human horde that has been reduced to its basest nature...and then begins to evolve.
There is really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clay, an arrow points home to Maine, and as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north they begin to see crude signs confirming their direction. A promise, perhaps. Or a threat...
There are 193 million cell phones in the United States alone. Who doesn't have one? Stephen King's utterly gripping, gory, and fascinating novel doesn't just ask the question,Can you hear me now? It answers it with a vengeance.",Fiction,Intermediate,9,1,13,4.7,13,3.64,2582,4.0,"For some reason, I had seen quite a few bad reviews on Cell before I read it. Not one to usually dislike a King novel, I did go into this one without the highest of expectations and ended up being very pleasantly surprised. 
 The story centers around a mass event that turns anyone who happens to be on their cell phone at the time into a zombie. Mass chaos ensues and a small group of survivors bands together and tries to figure out what is going on and how to stop it. Some of the plot-line does have some similarity to The Stand, but the characters are fairly unique, the dialog is good, and the action keeps rolling along at a fairly brisk pace. 
 I really liked this novel. I knew that I probably would, but it was a nice surprise that it was as good as it was. I am of the opinion that not everything that Stephen King writes is destined to be a classic, but the majority of his work is well above average and I feel that one day he will be given his long overdue kudos and be placed in the literary canon with the other greats of modern literature.",32.0,1,1307,5933.78,4.54,80,2,4,2
3,The Chosen,Chaim Potok,1967,2010,"Love or duty -- which would you choose? Prince Severin has been brought up to put duty before all else. Now, his duty is to marry and produce an heir. He has his choice of princesses. Unfortunately, his passion is for princes. Havyn has been a slave all his life. When his powers are discovered, he finds himself purchased and freed by a Prince and apprenticed to the royal wizard, Ildar. His duty is to stay chaste to keep his powers strong. Unfortunately, his passion is for Severin. With kingdoms at war, the throne hanging in the balance, and magic in the air, can the two men find happiness together, or is duty more important than love?",Fiction,Excellent,39,1,10,4.425,5,3.21,31,3.0,"The Chosen is a classic fantasy novel but without the epic length. Included are long journeys, prophesies, royalty, magic, oracles, wars at stake, forbidden love, runaway elopements, long lost princes, lengthy quests, true love, and a happy ending. Because the story stays pretty true to the fantasy origins, there is not originality offered but for those fans of the genre, the familiar themes are always welcome. The writing makes the story incredibly easy and fast to read so that kept my interest whereas if the pace had dragged I would have been bored. The characters are again right out of fantasy lore so nothing surprising but they are warm and likable. As a first novel, this is a decent fantasy offering that may be of interest to classic fantasy tales. 
 Severin is a prince out on a journey with his faithful wizard Ildar to find himself after a lifetime of being spoiled at his parent's whim. Severin buys Havyn at a slave auction, intending to free the man once they return to his home. Along the way, they discover Havyn has magical ability and Ildar quickly makes the ex-slave his new wizard's apprentice. Life isn't easy once they reach home though as Severin is set to wed the niece of a neighboring land, yet his chemistry with Havyn causes havoc for both. When the royal family and entourage set out for the betrothal ceremony, there is no end of problems. Murder, intrigue, runaways, long lost royalty, quests, true love, and a happy ending are all involved as the various characters find their way in this realm of magic and mystery. 
 There is a lot going on in this story but surprisingly, the plot never feels overwhelmed or too fast. Each issue brought up is well handled and builds upon the next so each piece is simply part of a bigger, more complicated whole. Some of the elements are pretty predictable and the story on the whole isn't wildly original. Often the plot feels obvious as the fantasy themes used are easy to identify so there is not a lot of suspense or wonder associated with reading. Yet the writing keeps the pace quick and characters interesting enough that even those who have read this type of story all the time will keep turning the page here. 
 Part of this is that the characters are pretty decent. Severin and Havyn narrate the story in alternating third person point of view and for the most part they stay well within the predictable roles. Havyn is slightly over the top with the orphan childhood sold into slavery from birth and never known a bath, clothing, food, or kindness. However this exaggeration is pretty typical of everyone in the book. All the characters seem to exist on the extremes of their description and supposedly almost all are virgins, which is necessary to fill their various roles. This is a bit of a stretch especially at the end when several of these mandates are flipped to provide a happy ending, but it didn't really bother me since it was clearly coming. 
 The various characters have a bit of charm, a bit of scheming, and some interest which kept me reading even though I knew what would happen - usually a sign I give up and become bored. Yet again, there's an ease to the writing that lets you enjoy the classic tale even if there is nothing surprising. The common themes are well loved for a reason and even though just about all used here, it pretty much works. This isn't a book that leaves you breathless but it is one you enjoy while reading. Or at least I mostly did.",7.0,1,4320,8596.8,1.99,1099,4,5,3
4,The Magicians,Lev Grossman,2009,2009,"A thrilling and original coming-of- age novel about a young man practicing magic in the real worldQuentin Coldwater is brilliant but miserable. A senior in high school, he's still secretly preoccupied with a series of fantasy novels he read as a child, set in a magical land called Fillory. Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery.He also discovers all the other things people learn in college: friendship, love, sex, booze, and boredom. Something is missing, though. Magic doesn't bring Quentin the happiness and adventure he dreamed it would. After graduation he and his friends make a stunning discovery: Fillory is real. But the land of Quentin's fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he could have imagined. His childhood dream becomes a nightmare with a shocking truth at its heart.At once psychologically piercing and magnificently absorbing, The Magicians boldly moves into uncharted literary territory, imagining magic as practiced by real people, with their capricious desires and volatile emotions. Lev Grossman creates an utterly original world in which good and evil aren't black and white, love and sex aren't simple or innocent, and power comes at a terrible price.",Fiction,Novice,1,9,9,9.0,13,3.48,45,3.0,"I'm torn, I finished it, which all told means I didn't think it was that bad. That said I'm not looking to go back and read it again right away, or ever for that matter. 
 The main character was not that interesting to me. I'm not big on whiners, I have a 9 year old boy in the house I don't need to read about them I live it, and I felt like he was a big whiner. 
 Not entirely true it didn't feel that bad in the first part of the book (aka Book 1) but once he left school, well blah. He had a bit in the middle that I felt like he might redeem himself, but not so much. 
 Then the ending left me annoyed, I kept thinking if he doesn't bring back Julia at some point I'm gonna be pissed, why have the character, then he does but in the last few paragraphs. I don't care enough about any of them to read the next book in the series. So I'm back to why even introduce her.

7,The Bonesetter'S Daughter,Amy Tan,2001,2001,"Ruth Young and her widowed mother, LuLing, have always had a tumultuous relationship. Now, before she succumbs to forgetfulness, LuLing gives Ruth some of her writings, which reveal a side of LuLing that Ruth has never known. . . .
In a remote mountain village where ghosts and tradition rule, LuLing grows up in the care of her mute Precious Auntie as the family endures a curse laid upon a relative known as the bonesetter. When headstrong LuLing rejects the marriage proposal of the coffinmaker, a shocking series of events are set in motion-all of which lead back to Ruth and LuLing in modern San Francisco. The truth that Ruth learns from her mother's past will forever change her perception of family, love, and forgiveness.",Nonfiction,Intermediate,16,2,14,8.375,9,3.98,997,3.0,"Like The Joy Luck Club, this book is about relationships between mothers and daughters, and the importance of knowing each other's life stories. In the first part of the book, we meet Ruth, a first generation Chinese-American working as a ghostwriter for New Age self-help books in California. She has a hard time asserting herself in her ten-year relationship with her boyfriend. Her mother, LuLing, has been recently diagnosed with dementia, and can no longer live alone. LuLing is depressed, critical, sends her daughter on guilt trips, and threatens to commit suicide whenever she is crossed. She believes in superstitions and curses, and needs to communicate with the dead when she makes important decisions. 
 The second part of the book tells the story of LuLing and the bonesetter's daughter back in China. This memoir written by LuLing, was my favorite part of the book. LuLing was part of a rural family that made high quality ink that was used in calligraphy. Both LuLing and her mother faced difficult challenges, and were never totally accepted by her father's family. In her teens, LuLing was taken in by missionaries during the Japanese occupation of China, and she later immigrated to the United States. LuLing's journal gives Ruth the knowledge to understand her mother better, and to make sense of Ruth's childhood. 
 The third part of the book is set in the present, and easy solutions are found for both LuLing's and Ruth's problems. A thread seems to tie the three generations of women together in strong, but difficult, mother-daughter relationships. 
 I had mixed feelings about this book. The first part of the book, about Ruth's problems and LuLing's negative parenting, dragged for me. The second part, set in China, was exciting with wonderful characters--the bonesetter grandfather, the wicked relatives, LuLing's first love, the suicidal nursemaid. The short third part brought things together well, but seemed to promise an almost too rosy future.",9.0,1,266,263.34,0.99,340,2,3,4

9,The Gathering Storm,Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson,2009,2015,"Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, looms. And mankind is not ready.
The final volume of the Wheel of Time, ""A Memory of Light, "" was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson, ""New York Times"" bestselling author of the Mistborn books, was chosen by Jordan's editor--his wife, Harriet McDougal--to complete the final book. The scope and size of the volume was such that it could not be contained in a single book, and so Tor proudly presents ""The Gathering Storm"" as the first of three novels that will cover the outline left by Robert Jordan, chronicling Tarmon Gai'don and Rand al'Thor's final confrontation with the Dark One. This short sequence will complete the struggle against the Shadow, bringing to a close a journey begun almost twenty years ago and marking the conclusion of the Wheel of Time, the preeminent fantasy epic of our era.
In this epic novel, Robert Jordan's international bestselling series begins its dramatic conclusion. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward--wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders--his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.
Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower--and possibly the world itself.
The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.",Fiction,Excellent,8,1,15,9.375,5,4.35,40,5.0,"'The Gathering Storm' is book 12 in 'The Wheel of Time' series, but it is the first book in the 'The Final Battle' trilogy, the last three books in the series. Incidentally, these final three books are written by Brandon Sanderson and not by Robert Jordan, who has passed away. I did not notice much difference in style (with the exception that the women do less folding of arms and pouting). The important thing is Jordan had notes and spoke about how he wanted the series to end, so Sanderson had an idea of what shape the Grand Finale would take. 
 And WOW! 'The Gathering Storm' was amazing! Egwene and Rand learn hard lessons about leadership in fighting their wars, while Perrin and Mat are reluctantly being drawn by their ta'veren connection to Rand into joining him at last (they haven't been in the same place for ten books). Perrin and Mat like to keep as far from Rand as he allows, but that is ending in 'The Gathering Storm'. (cue ominous music) Rand's outrage and continuing dark emo at being selected as the Dragon Reborn rings authentic to me (he wanted a normal life as a sheepherder and farmer, a life from which he has been ripped away, and instead he has been pushed into a world of blood, violence and unwanted sacrifice) but the sudden conversion by embracing Love in his Judean mountain moment - third temptation - did not. After I picked myself up from the floor after the condition prolonged helpless laughter left me, I decided this one scene was not going to deter me from enjoying the series. It is a Fantasy, after all. 
 Note: there is NO WAY to enjoy these books or understand what is going on without beginning with Book 1, The Eye of the World. 
 p.s. if you have any spanking perversions OR aversions, this series will be interesting for you on some, perhaps previously unknown, levels. I am finding the subject vaguely more interesting myself as I go along.",3.0,1,5076,20253.24,3.99,473,4,2,4

Perhaps Oscar Wilde's quote - ""We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars"" also sums up (far more successfully and succinctly) at least a large part of this book. 
 Bach's novel and message was perhaps all well and great at the time of publication and in the context of its time. Maybe 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' did seem revolutionary at that time, but now it reads as quite a crude, clumsy and basic attempt at profundity and wisdom. 
 With little flair or much real imagination, what we have is the life and flight of a seagull (the author being a pilot) as a metaphor for life being lived without limits, seemingly as the path to immortality. 
 Neither as strong, compelling or as moving as I'd anticipated and hoped, given the novel's reputation, 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' was overall unfortunately underwhelming. There are faint echoes here of C S Lewis (Narnia/Aslan) - but without the flair for evocative storytelling. Ultimately a disappointing read.

To give birth to her ""chap,"" demon-mother Mia has usurped the body of Susannah Dean and used the power of Black Thirteen to transport to New York City in the summer of 1999. The city is strange to Susannah...and terrifying to the ""daughter of none,"" who shares her body and mind.

17,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,Seth Grahame-Smith,2010,2010,"Indiana, 1818.Moonlight falls through the dense woods that surround a one-room cabin, where a nine-year-old Abraham Lincoln kneels at his suffering mother's bedside. She's been stricken with something the old-timers call ""Milk Sickness.""
""My baby boy..."" she whispers before dying.
Only later will the grieving Abe learn that his mother's fatal affliction was actually the work of a vampire.
When the truth becomes known to young Lincoln, he writes in his journal, ""henceforth my life shall be one of rigorous study and devotion. I shall become a master of mind and body. And this mastery shall have but one purpose..."" Gifted with his legendary height, strength, and skill with an ax, Abe sets out on a path of vengeance that will lead him all the way to the White House.
While Abraham Lincoln is widely lauded for saving a Union and freeing millions of slaves, his valiant fight against the forces of the undead has remained in the shadows for hundreds of years. That is, until Seth Grahame-Smith stumbled upon The Secret Journal of Abraham Lincoln, and became the first living person to lay eyes on it in more than 140 years.
Using the journal as his guide and writing in the grand biographical style of Doris Kearns Goodwin and David McCullough, Seth has reconstructed the truelife story of our greatest president for the first time-all while revealing the hidden history behind the Civil War and uncovering the role vampires played in the birth, growth, and near-death of our nation.",Fiction,Intermediate,7,4,15,8.0,6,3.7,107211,3.0,"Just didn't grab my interest like I expected it to.

25,Ender'S Shadow,Orson Scott Card,1999,1999,"Ender's Shadowis being dubbed as a parallel novel to Orson Scott Card's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Ender's Game. By ""parallel,"" Card means that Shadowbegins and ends at roughly the same time as Game, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity's fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of Shadow, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know.
Although it may seem like Shadowis merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous Ender's Game, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of Ender's Gamehinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, Shadowmanages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that Shadow, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. --Craig E. Engler",Nonfiction,Intermediate,1,15,15,15.0,2,4.3,1211,3.0,"Originally posted on SpecFic Junkie. 
 I remember being excited as a kid when I saw this in the ""New"" section at one of the University of Texas libraries. I remember my mother and I thinking it was pretty decent. And that's the feeling I get from it now. It's okay, but doesn't stand up to the later Ender books, like Speaker for the Dead or Xenocide. It also deals with religion very differently, which isn't surprising to me. 
 The whole point of the Ender's Shadow series is that Orson Scott Card realized there was a lot more story to tell, especially considering the rather large time jump between Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. Originally, he'd planned to let another author pen the series, but as he delved into the idea, he fell in love with it too much to give away. 
 Ender's Shadow follows the story of Bean, one of the children that was part of Ender's Dragon army. The story starts with Bean's early childhood as a starving street kid. We learn that he's incredibly smart, both in intelligence and street smarts, which we see through him saving a crew of kids on the street (partially to save himself) and when he gets taken under the wing of a nun who wants to educate him. 
 When he's on the street, Bean comes across his own Peter. He convinces Poke, the leader of the crew, that in order to survive, they need protection from one of the ""bullies."" When they take down Achilles, Bean sees that the best end for all of them is to kill Achilles to make a statement. He's too dangerous alive. 
 Instead, Poke shows mercy, and pretty much takes over the crew, turning them into his ""family."" But when another bully who was brought down by Achilles in the line for the soup kitchen is released from the hospital, Achilles tells everyone he must flee. Bean leaves and sees Achilles kiss, then kill, Poke. He then realizes that Achilles plans to pit the murder on Ulysses, the other bully, in order to better sway the street kids to his favor. 
 Bean also realizes that he will never be safe from Achilles. 
 When Bean eventually gets into Battle School, he's treated like Ender was originally. Unfortunately, coming after Ender, he's also constantly compared to him. So what Bean has to do is separate himself from Ender, to prove that he's his own man. He uses a lot more subterfuge than Ender to make this point, creating a teacher account to go into those records and crawling around in the vents. 
 In the end, we find out that Bean is somewhat the mastermind behind choosing the members of Dragon Army, and so in many ways, the success to that experiment. 
 All-in-all, the plot is kind of fun if you were invested in Ender's Game more than the later books and is clearly written for that audience. Nothing is really that subtle or profound. There are no real moral statements to be made, beyond the obvious. Obviously Bean comes in contact with Achilles again and bests him. Obviously Bean is shown to have great potential. None of this is shocking or really tells us that much beyond the plot of the story. 
 What was kind of surprising to me is the way religion is treated in the story. Almost all of Orson Scott Card's books have somewhat flirted with religion. Ender's Game had the least of it, actually, even though the reason Ender exists is because his father was a Catholic and was looking for an excuse to have a third child. Speaker for the Dead dealt heavily with religion and religious morality with the Catholic nature of the colony and the idea of bringing religion to the uneducated aliens. Xenocide and Children of the Mind both dealt with religion as well, though in a heavily negative light. 
 In Ender's Shadow, though, religion is shown to be flawed as an institution (the nun in the story doesn't think she'll be taken back by her sisters after her work) but beautiful and profound to the individual. The religious morality isn't a hit over the head, but it certainly is more constant, albeit downplayed, throughout the entire work. 
 It's not uncommon for the Mormon church to push successful authors to show more religious viewpoints in their works over time. I almost wonder if that's what's happening to Orson Scott Card. While he was overtly religious in some of his other works (re-writing the Book of Mormon as scifi, anyone?) the Ender series was his bread-and-butter, and didn't really examine religion in a positive light. 
 Mostly, I found Ender's Shadow to be a fun, but simplistic read. After reading it, I don't expect to get much out of the other novels. However, considering Ender's Game was a completely different read than the later books, maybe they'll up in complexity over time.",2.0,1,416,411.84,0.99,250,3,1,5
26,White Teeth,Zadie Smith,2000,2001,"On New Year's morning, 1975, Archie Jones sits in his car on a London road and waits for the exhaust fumes to fill his Cavalier Musketeer station wagon. Archie--working-class, ordinary, a failed marriage under his belt--is calling it quits, the deciding factor being the flip of a 20-pence coin. When the owner of a nearby halal butcher shop (annoyed that Archie's car is blocking his delivery area) comes out and bangs on the window, he gives Archie another chance at life and sets in motion this richly imagined, uproariously funny novel.
Epic and intimate, hilarious and poignant, White Teethis the story of two North London families--one headed by Archie, the other by Archie's best friend, a Muslim Bengali named Samad Iqbal. Pals since they served together in World War II, Archie and Samad are a decidedly unlikely pair. Plodding Archie is typical in every way until he marries Clara, a beautiful, toothless Jamaican woman half his age, and the couple have a daughter named Irie (the Jamaican word for ""no problem""). Samad --devoutly Muslim, hopelessly ""foreign""-- weds the feisty and always suspicious Alsana in a prearranged union. They have twin sons named Millat and Magid, one a pot-smoking punk-cum-militant Muslim and the other an insufferable science nerd. The riotous and tortured histories of the Joneses and the Iqbals are fundamentally intertwined, capturing an empire's worth of cultural identity, history, and hope.
Zadie Smith's dazzling first novel plays out its bounding, vibrant course in a Jamaican hair salon in North London, an Indian restaurant in Leicester Square, an Irish poolroom turned immigrant cafe, a liberal public school, a sleek science institute. A winning debut in every respect, White Teethmarks the arrival of a wondrously talented writer who takes on the big themes --faith, race, gender, history, and culture-- and triumphs.",Fiction,Intermediate,3,14,16,15.0,5,3.75,84311,4.0,"The more I think about this book, the more I marvel at what Zadie Smith was able to create through it. I seriously almost didn't make it through this read, and it is only in the looking back that I see just how brilliant it is. Smith starts with two characters, then links character after character to them. 
 It all starts with two men lost in WWI, having no real role in it, and discover it has ended without their knowledge. They capture a war architect after the war and invent stories in some attempt to claim true manhood. There is so much story in between. Two twin brothers, one who is sent back to the Middle East in hopes of retaining the Muslim ways. The other fully engaged in all things secular. 
 Smith does a lot of meandering, but in the end, what do a fundamentalist Muslim, a Jehovah's Witness, and ardent animal rights activists have in common? Sounds like a joke, but as it turns out, quite a lot. 
 A few things this book had me thinking about. 
 -How science and religion have become polarized. 
 -How different one generation is from the next, and how this impacts both. 
 -Many things are not at all what we expect. 
 -What defines manhood. 
 -How black and white thinking is so dangerous. 
 -How one action leads to unforeseen others, and all of life seems connected. 
 My only real problem with this read was the length of the meandering narratives.",54.0,1,4563,4517.37,0.99,524,3,1,4

32,Freedom,William Safire,1987,2010,"In his first novel since The Corrections, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Walter and Patty Berglund as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.
(from the back cover)",Fiction,Intermediate,10,6,15,8.517241379310345,3,3.73,516,4.0,"It's always hard to review a complete brick of a book (literally speaking), and this one is quite something. 
 Franzen has almost entirely adhered to the simple point-and-tell way of God informing the reader of what happens throughout the book, interspersed with a few character perspective moments. 
 Walter and Patty Berglund are a smart, suburban, modern married couple who are in turmoil and seemingly cannot come to terms with this. They avoid each other rather, avoiding their issues apart from when they fight, which is like a cold, staged play, reminiscent of Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"" in some affects. 
 Franzen's main strengths are the storytelling, the parallel plots and treating the reader like an intelligent person. At the same time, the best bits of this book read way better than a very long episode of ""Desperate Housewives"", which it often reminded me of. At its worst, the book reminded me of a very long, outstretched and bloated episode of ""Desperate Housewives"". 
 Some might say this book pin-points the human condition of relationships in modern-day western civilisation, and I'll say it does to a certain extent. Franzen is very good at writing matter-of-factly when it comes to describing human emotions which I think works to his advantage: the reader is allowed to think for herself/himself and the characters of the book come out a lot differently than if Franzen would have applied sappy adjectives throughout. 
 All in all, this is a big book, and I think its flaws and brilliance is part of what it's all about: people's inner worlds, as felt inside and projected outside. Highly recommendable, masterfully written despite a few lows, ending up with being one of the best fictional books I've read in a few years.",0.0,0,860,6871.400000000001,7.99,128,1,3,1

 I find it hard to review these books. How do you review books that are Fantasy classics? These are books that everybody already knows are good. I find it difficult to express how great these books are. I mean besides Lord of the Rings this has to be considered the best classic Epic Fantasy right? Well I guess I will just take it book by book and see what happens. This is yet another great book in this series. What a wonderful story. Awesome characters. The worldbuilding is just fantastic. Robert Jordan deserves his reputation as the outstanding author he was. This series deserves it's place near the top of all epic fantasy. The adventures of Rand, Perrin, and Mat are truly epic. Classic fantasy at it's best. You have reluctant heroes, Dark powers, magic, diverse people, and great battles. 
 Overall another great book in the series. It has some wonderfully memorable moments. It is also is beginning to slow down a bit. I don't mind so much because I am so attached to the characters and the story, but I can see were all the complaining comes from. I am looking forward to continuing this fantastic series. 
 The only regret I have with this book, and the series is that I did not read it sooner! I can see now that I am going to be obsessed with this series. I finally know what all the hype was about from all the WoT fans out there. Now I am one of you. I wanted to read the whole series this year (As you can see I am very behind). 
 As you know if you have read my reviews before I am not about long reviews with synopsis and spoilers. I just give my opinion on my experience with this book and you can take it from there. Now on to the next book.

 Despite being fully engaged by the story, there are a few things I didn't like about the book. I found the main character Nate O'reilly completely unsympathetic. I was very disappointed that the story started out with such a bang and then ended with a whimper. Once again, Grisham could have used a better editor.

 I'm gonna be a little spoilery. :) 
 Why? The re-read was actually rather satisfying. Yes, it's a novel about survival and all the kinds of crap that men make women do to satisfy themselves, but it's also a rather moving novel about keeping (or losing) one's sanity in the face of all those expectations. 
 Never mind the sheer horror of being handcuffed to a bed without hope of being saved because your lover just keeled over, or watching a dog eat your husband as you go thirsty. It's a lot more than just that. It's memories and other humiliations and the struggle to find oneself through one hell of an ordeal. 
 Plus, I kinda like the fact that we're dealing with a very Poe-ish or Aristotelian art-ethic here. It's very focused in time and place, forcing us to go down deep into the subconscious. I can't help but appreciate that more now than when I was younger. *shrug* 
 Either way, I also enjoyed the almost tacked-on feel of the extended denouement. It really gave a sense of reflection and of shoring up her defenses after having them all stripped away, both literally and figuratively. I felt the power of the positive reversal. 
 Now, I should say that I'm revising this from my three stars to four based mainly on the fact that the novel is good on its own, but when I chose to give it three (from memory), I did so based on my enjoyment in comparison with the rest of Stephen King's works. It isn't his strongest novel by far, but it was still quite enjoyable.

One school consider this the weakest of the seven volumes. They can't see what the point is. A huge flashback - stuff that has already happened - how does that advance the plot? I call these people the Rolands. The other school considers this to be the finest book of the series, they loved every page of the thing. They think the huge flash-back was a wonderful story in itself which develops a greater understanding of what motivates the gunslinger and where he came from. I call these people the Oys. 
 I'm an Oy in this regard. Oys think the books are about the journey not the destination. Rolands think the destination (tower) is all-important and that any step to the side or backwards is an abomination. 
 I believe the message of this series (slight spoiler) is that we should be Oys rather than Rolands 
 This is King at his best. Wonderfully rich characters and setting. Great imagination, brilliant description, scary evil, and the tension rising relentlessly with stakes that you're made to value. 
 It's been a while since I read this, so I won't comment in more detail. 
 For me, not only is it the best volume but each successive volume after this is a little less good. However, I can't attribute this to the author's age/decline as I also rated The Wind Through The Keyhole very highly, and that's a nominal volume 8 which sits around 4.5 in truth and is set (IIRC) in the period a little after that covered by the flashback that occupies most of Wizard and Glass.

A ghost who keeps complaining about her lost necklace. She wants Lara to find it. As if Lara didn't have enough problem with work that is falling apart. Soon Sadie is making changes cos she wants to have fun. 
 Poor Lara, Sadie sure knew how to mix it up and trust me, she puts Lara in some pretty embarrassing circumstances. Sometimes I just put the book away and smiled a bit, while feeling embarrassed for her. But that is chick-lit, embarrassing moments is a must. 
 But there is also romance, and not just cos she is half stalking her ex. No, she is being pushed somewhere else, even if she does not want it. But with all her faults, and good sides, Lara is a pretty nice person. The poor guy that comes in her and Sadi'es way is pretty nice too. Sadie is, well dunno about her, she is so happy and, well good at least for Lara. Who needs to find her groove again. 
 I do like the shopaholic books more, sure I read this really fast, smiled a bit, but perhaps something was lacking to making it into great chick-lit. But as it was now it still was good, and made me happy.

 WE CAN'T BE ALONE 
 The universe is a pretty big place. If it's just us, seems like an awful waste of space. 
 When I read this book, back then in 1997, I did it like a couple of months before of being able to watch the film adaptation. (And I am truly glad that I was able to get the movie in blu-ray, a few months ago in this year, 2014)) 
 This is truly great novel and it's written by one of the most respected scientist in the field about science of outer space, Carl Sagan. 
 Readers who enjoy techno-thrillers in the style of Michael Chrichton, I am sure that they will find this book the same as enjoyable. 
 Sagan is able to merge all his factual science knowledge with strong theories and very possible science fiction. 
 If you want to read about a ""first contact"" with an alien intelligence in a form as ""real"" as possible, this is your novel. 
 THAT MESMERIZING DARK SPACE 
 For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love. 
 Sagan never compromised his credibility as a real scientist just to sell cheap action in this novel. 
 This is a smart tale with many hard science, but also it contains great characters with exceptional developing. 
 Since after all, only science can't tell a story, there must be people, and people has feelings, and you will perceive them. 
 He knows what he is doing and you get a very realistic aproach of how you could expect the human civilization can deal with the impact of knowing that we are not alone in the universe anymore. 
 If you are looking for flying saucers blasting lasers and the army fighting bravely against them, this is NOT your book. I have nothing against that approach, don't get me wrong. I like that kind of stories too. But, I think that it's fair to have once in a while a mature angle to craft a story about the first meeting with an alien intelligence. 
 You have here a very intelligent story with a strong scientific background.

When Elspeth Noblin dies of cancer, she leaves her London apartment to her twin nieces, Julia and Valentina. These two American girls never met their English aunt, only knew that their mother, too, was a twin, and Elspeth her sister.

There is Martin, a brilliant and charming crossword puzzle setter suffering from crippling Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; Marjike, Martin's devoted but trapped wife; and Robert, Elspeth's elusive lover, a scholar of the cemetery. As the girls become embroiled in the fraying lives of their aunt's neighbors, they also discover that much is still alive in Highgate, including--perhaps--their aunt, who can't seem to leave her old apartment and life behind.

 SWEDISH REVIEW 
 Om det ar nagot Mo Hayder kan sa ar det att skriva bocker som gar under skinnet pa en. Precis som Dennis Lehane sa vagar hon ta ut svangarna och det ar med isande fasa man laser varje sida. 
 Forsvunnen ar inget undantag. Att lasa om kidnappade barn ar hemskt och man vet inte om Jack Caffery kommer att lyckas radda situationen. Caffery ar en lysande polis, men i denna bok sa verkar det som om kidnapparen kan forutse polisen nasta drag och ju mer tiden gar desto mer lutar det at att det ar forsent, att flickan inte kommer att raddas. 
 Sedan har vi polisdykaren Flea Marley, som lever med konsekvenserna fran foregaende bok, vilket stor henne i jobbet. Hon vet inte om att Jack misstanker henne for ett brott som hon faktiskt ar oskyldig till men som i och med det Jack vet om det ter sig logiskt att han misstanker henne. Nu ger hon sig in kampen for att radda den kidnappade flickan. Men ar hon verkligen i form att ta sig an fallet? Kommer hon istallet bara att riskera sitt eget liv? 
 Forsvunnen ar en ruggig thriller dar den okande forovaren hela tiden lurar i bakgrunden och man sitter pa helspand pa slutet nar Caffery konfronterar forovaren. Fragan ar kommer allting att sluta lyckligt?

 ENGLISH REVIEW 
 If there is one thing Mo Hayder knows is it to write a book that crawls under your skin. She dares, just like Dennis Lehane can she write in such a way that it's with terror you turn each page. 
 Gone is no exception. Reading about kidnapped children is always terrible and you do not know if Jack Caffery will be able to save the kidnapped girl. Caffery is a brilliant police, but in this book, the kidnapper seems to anticipate every single move the police do, and as more time goes by, the fear grows that they will be too late. 
 Then we have police diver Flea Marley, who lives with the consequences from the previous book, which has consequences for her at work. She does not know that Jack suspects her for a crime she's actually innocent of. Although it's quite logical that he suspects her since he doesn't have the whole picture. Now she decides to search for the kidnapped girl. But, is she really in shape to help out? Or will she only risk her own life? 
 Gone is a tough thriller where the unidentified perpetrator always lurks in the background, and at the end, when Caffery confronts the perpetrator will you still question if everything will end happily...
