491,Paradise Lost,J. A. Jance,2001,2003,"John Milton's Paradise Lost is one of the greatest epic poems in the English language. It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.
Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.

1624,The Boston Girl,Anita Diamant,2014,2014,"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Red Tent and Day After Night, comes an unforgettable coming-of-age novel about family ties and values, friendship and feminism told through the eyes of a young Jewish woman growing up in Boston in the early twentieth century.
Addie Baum is The Boston Girl, born in 1900 to immigrant parents who were unprepared for and suspicious of America and its effect on their three daughters. Growing up in the North End, then a teeming multicultural neighborhood, Addie's intelligence and curiosity take her to a world her parents can't imagine - a world of short skirts, movies, celebrity culture and new opportunities for women. Addie wants to finish high school and dreams of going to college. She wants a career and to find true love.
Eighty-five-year-old Addie tells the story of her life to her twenty-two-year-old granddaughter, who has asked her ""How did you get to be the woman you are today?"" She begins in 1915, the year she found her voice and made friends who would help shape the course of her life. From the one-room tenement apartment she shared with her parents and two sisters, to the library group for girls she joins at a neighborhood settlement house, to her first, disastrous love affair, Addie recalls her adventures with compassion for the naive girl she was and a wicked sense of humor.
Written with the same attention to historical detail and emotional resonance that made Anita Diamant's previous novels bestsellers, The Boston Girl is a moving portrait of one woman's complicated life in twentieth-century America, and a fascinating look at a generation of women finding their places in a changing world.",Fiction,Intermediate,12,6,15,11.583333333333334,7,3.79,49893.3886509636,4.0,"I really enjoyed this book, much more than I thought.

When Elspeth Noblin dies of cancer, she leaves her London apartment to her twin nieces, Julia and Valentina. These two American girls never met their English aunt, only knew that their mother, too, was a twin, and Elspeth her sister. Julia and Valentina are semi-normal American teenagers--with seemingly little interest in college, finding jobs, or anything outside their cozy home in the suburbs of Chicago, and with an abnormally intense attachment to one another.
The girls move to Elspeth's flat, which borders Highgate Cemetery in London. They come to know the building's other residents. There is Martin, a brilliant and charming crossword puzzle setter suffering from crippling Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; Marjike, Martin's devoted but trapped wife; and Robert, Elspeth's elusive lover, a scholar of the cemetery. As the girls become embroiled in the fraying lives of their aunt's neighbors, they also discover that much is still alive in Highgate, including--perhaps--their aunt, who can't seem to leave her old apartment and life behind.

980,Dreamcatcher,Stephen King,2001,2002,"What might be done to human beings by the ""Other""--whether the ""Other"" be vampires, demons or creatures from outer space--is always in competition for absolute horror with what we do to ourselves. Stephen King has, in his time, played with both sources of the nightmarish and in Dreamcatcher, the first complete novel since his near-fatal accident, he gives us both.
Four childhood friends, united by secrets, are caught in the quarantine zone when something crashes into the remote forests of Maine; and the question becomes who will avoid being eaten alive by alien fungi, torn from the inside by alien ferrets, possessed by alien minds or menaced by a psychotic military commander to whom ruthlessness has become a macho ego trip?
The Earth is in peril as well, needless to say, but most of our attention is taken up with a few men caught on the edge, and where the most important thing in the world turns out to be the fact that four small boys saved a fifth from a beating.
This has the hall-marks of a good King novel--memorable catchphrases whose meaning we only gradually learn and a sense of how it feels to be human. --Roz Kaveney",Fiction,Intermediate,15,1,15,5.2,10,3.6051875,98066.88125,3.0,"As I was going up the stair 
 I meet a man who wasn't there; 
 He wasn't there again today! 
 I wish, I wish he'd stay away. 
 Well, what a ride that was... 
 Rating this book was quite hard. I'm still not sure if I'm okay with giving it 3 stars, because it had so many good characters, parts and plot twists, so one part of me feels like giving it 5 stars. But then again, at some parts, it left me feeling miserable and asking myself if I was ever going to finish it, so because of that, the other part of me think that it deserves only 2 stars. So I guess I'll just have to settle and give it 3 (3.3) stars. But still, I don't think I've ever wished that Goodreads had a half-star system, as much as I do now. 
 Dreamcatcher is a book about alien invasion, but it's unlike any other alien invasion book. Also, it is unlike any other Stephen King's book that I've read. The book started out great. I actually loved the first half. I loved getting to know our main characters, I loved the plot, and I loved how King introduced aliens. There were even some scenes that creeped me out, and at some parts I even had to stop reading for a few seconds. But then, somewhere in the middle, something happened, and the book unfortunately got worse. It started dragging on and at some parts it became flat out boring. Then, maybe 50 pages before the end, the pace picked up again, and it got back to being amazing. I absolutely loved the way it ended, and how everything came together. 
 When it comes to characters, just like in any other King's work, they were my favorite part of this book (well, at least some of them were). I loved our main four characters (Henry and Jonesy especially). I also loved Duddits, and even Owen. But, on the other hand, there is Kurtz - a character I absolutely despised. And he is the main reason why I had problems with this book. I think that his character was completely unnecessary. I loved reading from everyone's point of view except from his. And the irony was that his chapters got bigger and bigger as the book went on. In my opinion, he brought nothing to the story, and was only there to make it longer. If his character was removed from the story I don't think that anything important in the plot would change. 
 In the end, even though this book made me question my sanity a few times, I'm still glad that I've read it. Even though it had some bad parts, it also had so many more amazing parts.",54.0,1,1516800,7568832.0,4.99,310

 Scout Press is a new imprint from Gallery Books ""dedicated to being on the lookout for modern storytellers."" They've roared onto the scene with two releases, Ruth Ware's In A Dark, Dark Woods and (now Longlist National Book Award Nominee) Bill Clegg's Did You Ever Have A Family. I received a promo e-mail about Scout Press before these two were released, and like a chump I passed them over. Once I heard the endless roaring buzz of praise, I picked up In A Dark, Dark Woods on audio, and listened everywhere, all the time, unable to stop. 
 Ware's In A Dark, Dark Wood sounds like many things-don't confuse it with Into The Woods, the Broadway play adapted into a feature film, or master of mystery Tana French's novel In The Woods. Ever since the Brothers Grimm put the grim in our fairy tales, the woods have been a nightmarish place to lose yourself and tap into the pulse of a canopied underworld severed from sunlight and all things good. In A Dark, Dark Wood acts as an homage to so much that lives in the dark of our nightmares-ghosts, guns, unrequited loves, strangers prowling, phone lines cut, murders in the midst. 
 In this mystery, instead of wolves or headless horsemen, the woods brings horrors of a particularly modern variety. Reclusive author Leonora reluctantly agrees to attend a long lost school friend's hen party (for us unaware Americans, that's the British equivalent of a bachelorette party). The most majestic and notable part of this novel is the hen party's setting, a glass house nestled amidst a muddy and isolated woods far out in the English countryside. Each attendee to the soiree feels like a performer, vulnerable and exposed in front of a vast expanse of trees. This is the type of isolated home found at the end of a muddy long drive, where cell reception blips from on bar to none, where the land line in the kitchen feels like a life line to the outside world. 
 The night turns strange quite quickly. Clare, the bride-to-be, has invited a ragtag bunch, with Leonora and her sarcastic sidekick Nina not necessarily adding to the party atmosphere. There's new mother Melanie, who struggles to pull her eyes up from her phone, aghast at no reception. There's flamboyant and coke-touting Tom, the hard partying token gay man at the celebration. And finally, there's Flo. Flo worships Clare, dresses like Clare, and insists that Clare will have the best hen party ever. No matter what. 
 The isolated party in a strange glass house, fueled by alcohol and Flo's intensity, quickly moves past social niceties and into the realm of something else. Leonora wakes up battered and brutalized in a hospital bed, police at her door. No longer in a glass house, no longer at a hen night. She takes us along in her struggle to remember what exactly turned a hen party into a much darker, more dangerous trip into the woods. 
 Ware's building of suspense is magnificent here, especially in the first half of the novel. Unfortunately, amnesia plays a critical plot point near the end, which always tries my patience as a mystery lover. The writing here is so good though, that I'm willing to overlook this. I do hope Ware steers clear of such devices in her next book. The setting and characters build an unbearable, but irresistible paranoia, that makes In A Dark, Dark Wood an ideal mystery, a quick one to flip through then finish.",0.0,0,8259520,210208.68,0.99,1153

815,Firefly Lane,Kristin Hannah,2008,2008,"In the summer of 1974, Kate Mularkey has accepted her place at the bottom of the eighth-grade social food chain. Then, to her amazement, the ""coolest girl in the world"" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all--beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn; Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become TullyandKate. Inseparable.
So begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Laneis the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the mainstay of their lives.
From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success...and loneliness.
All Kate really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her...how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend....
For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship--jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart...and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.
Firefly Laneis for anyone who ever drank Boone's Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it's the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It's about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you--and knows what has the power to hurt you...and heal you.

1523,This Is How You Lose Her,Junot Díaz,2012,2012,"On a beach in the Dominican Republic, a doomed relationship flounders. In the heat of a hospital laundry room in New Jersey, a woman does her lover's washing and thinks about his wife. In Boston, a man buys his love child, his only son, a first baseball bat and glove. At the heart of these stories is the irrepressible, irresistible Yunior, a young hardhead whose longing for love is equaled only by his recklessness--and by the extraordinary women he loves and loses: artistic Alma; the aging Miss Lora; Magdalena, who thinks all Dominican men are cheaters; and the love of his life, whose heartbreak ultimately becomes his own.
In prose that is endlessly energetic, inventive, tender, and funny, the stories in This Is How You Lose Herlay bare the infinite longing and inevitable weakness of the human heart. They remind us that passion always triumphs over experience, and that ""the half-life of love is forever.""",Nonfiction,Intermediate,6,6,15,8.833333333333334,5,3.75,61195.28253706754,2.0,"This is a collection of short stories about Yunior. Yunior is a louse. All the men in his life are serial cheaters from his father to his brother to his best friend. Yes, there is a pitch that this is part of the Dominican Culture -- but frankly I can speak with women friends of mine from France, Spain, Italy, Russia, Germany and England and every single one of them knows this guy or has dated this clown. He screws around on women, and when he is caught and discarded there is great chest thumping and hair tearing and he learns...nothing. 
 Mr. Diaz provides imagery fireworks -- great use of language, flying sentences, created a real louse of a character (Yunior) who keeps you reading because, well it's like watching a bad driver wreck his same car in the same way 5 or six times. 
 My big problem with this book is that is left me unmoved and oddly unfeeling, considering the subject matter. Took me a while to figure it out. 
 There is not one fully drawn women character in any of these stories. In fact, there is one story that took me until page six to figure out it was supposed to be a female character. The women are merely devices to allow Yunior to react to something. Even he, Mr Diaz, on his website talks about his inability to create female characters -- he's male. Had the writer gotten past this, as many male writers do, he coud have opened up the story to a real look at this explosive topic.",216.0,1,229708224,4545798.720000001,5.38,865

Who will fall to Cujo before the disease he carries finishes him off? 
 I'm just going to come out and say it. Most of this book feels like filler to me. I think King took what was potentially an award winning tale of terror and jammed as much padding into it as he could until it was one of his shorter novels. Basically, it's a fantastic short story wrapped in a soap opera I couldn't give two shits about. 
 That being said, Cujo is a really powerful book in places. While I didn't care about a lot of things on the periphery, the core of it is pretty terrifying and heart-wrenching. No one wants their beloved family pet to turn on them and a rabid dog trapping a woman and her child in a car for DAYS is damn horrifying. As opposed to most of his menaces, Cujo is all too plausible. 
 The writing is good and the ending packs a huge punch. I sure didn't see that coming. It was like being kicked in the balls after you're already lying on the ground after being shot in the heart.

1856,The Round House,Louise Erdrich,2012,2012,"An exquisitely told story of a boy on the cusp of manhood who seeks justice and understanding in the wake of a terrible crime that upends and forever transforms his family.
One of the most revered novelists of our time - a brilliant chronicler of Native-American life - Louise Erdrich returns to the territory of her bestselling, Pulitzer Prize finalist The Plague of Doves with The Round House, transporting readers to the Ojibwe reservation in North Dakota. It is an exquisitely told story of a boy on the cusp of manhood who seeks justice and understanding in the wake of a terrible crime that upends and forever transforms his family.
Riveting and suspenseful, arguably the most accessible novel to date from the creator of Love Medicine, The Beet Queen, and The Bingo Palace, Erdrich's The Round House is a page-turning masterpiece of literary fiction - at once a powerful coming-of-age story, a mystery, and a tender, moving novel of family, history, and culture.",Fiction,Intermediate,12,12,16,14.25,14,3.91,62586.60418342719,4.0,"Before this, I'd only read Erdrich's children's fiction. It turns out she is able to write for adults, too! 
 This book has so many things going for it. It shows Native Americans in a (somewhat) contemporary setting, rather than historical. It brings awareness to issues that tribes face regarding land and jurisdiction. And, every chapter title is the title of a TNG episode. One of the things in the book is that the teen characters really like TNG. Although I was a bit annoyed that Troi's name was misspelled... you'd think an editor would have caught that. 
 Anyway this is a family tragedy as seen through the eyes of a 13-year old boy. Erdrich portrays both positives and negatives of life on the reservation, giving the non-Native reader a peek into that world. The details of the story are gritty sometimes, but there is also humor and love and affection between the characters. I'd recommend for anyone who likes contemporary literature.",0.0,0,586377792,5307261.96,2.99,764

As Julia adjusts to the new normal, the slowing inexorably continues.

 I find it hard to review these books. How do you review books that are Fantasy classics? These are books that everybody already knows are good. I find it difficult to express how great these books are. I mean besides Lord of the Rings this has to be considered the best classic Epic Fantasy right? Well I guess I will just take it book by book and see what happens. This is yet another great book in this series. What a wonderful story. Awesome characters. The worldbuilding is just fantastic. Robert Jordan deserves his reputation as the outstanding author he was. This series deserves it's place near the top of all epic fantasy. The adventures of Rand, Perrin, and Mat are truly epic. Classic fantasy at it's best. You have reluctant heroes, Dark powers, magic, diverse people, and great battles. 
 Overall another great book in the series. It has some wonderfully memorable moments. It is also is beginning to slow down a bit. I don't mind so much because I am so attached to the characters and the story, but I can see were all the complaining comes from. I am looking forward to continuing this fantastic series. 
 The only regret I have with this book, and the series is that I did not read it sooner! I can see now that I am going to be obsessed with this series.

 I really liked the atmosphere and the ideas in Night Watch. It was so different from American urban fantasy. It's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys, even though they are clearly labeled. I really felt like I was in a magical Moscow. 
 What I didn't like was how disjointed it seemed. I think it must have originally been three novellas that were put together as a novel. While the three stories were sequential and had a story arc, they still seemed like three individual stories. I normally don't mind this technique, but I found it jarring in this case. I also found Anton to be a bit to naive to be believable. Although I was walking around in his head, I didn't feel like I really knew him. 
 Overall, I would give this book 3-1/2 stars. I'm still undecided about finishing the series.",6.0,1,64152,20038.92,7.99,947
1824,The Longest Ride,Nicholas Sparks,2013,2013,"Ira Levinson is in trouble. At 91 years old, in poor health and alone in the world, he finds himself stranded on an isolated embankment after a car crash. Suffering multiple injuries, he struggles to retain consciousness until a blurry image materializes and comes into focus beside him: his beloved wife Ruth, who passed away nine years ago. Urging him to hang on, she forces him to remain alert by recounting the stories of their lifetime together - how they met, the precious paintings they collected together, the dark days of WWII and its effect on them and their families. Ira knows that Ruth can't possibly be in the car with him, but he clings to her words and his memories, reliving the sorrows and everyday joys that defined their marriage.
A few miles away, at a local rodeo, a Wake Forest College senior's life is about to change. Recovering from a recent break-up, Sophia Danko meets a young cowboy named Luke, who bears little resemblance to the privileged frat boys she has encountered at school. Through Luke, Sophia is introduced to a world in which the stakes of survival and success, ruin and reward - even life and death - loom large in everyday life. As she and Luke fall in love, Sophia finds herself imagining a future far removed from her plans - a future that Luke has the power to rewrite... if the secret he's keeping doesn't destroy it first.
Ira and Ruth. Sophia and Luke. Two couples who have little in common, and who are separated by years and experience. Yet their lives will converge with unexpected poignancy, reminding us all that even the most difficult decisions can yield extraordinary journeys: beyond despair, beyond death, to the farthest reaches of the human heart.",Fiction,Excellent,16,1,13,6.75,7,4.13,62372.56008902077,5.0,"For a more in depth review, please visit my blog, Chorley Chronicals! 
 Nicholas Sparks has always been one of my favorite author's. He was actually one of if not THE first author that I ever discovered. At one time, I couldn't get enough of his writing, and soaked up every single one of his books. Then I started dabbling with other author's and honestly haven't came back to him until now. Oh my, although I hadn't realized it until the first few minutes into the book, how did I miss him and his writing! 
 Sparks has an extraordinary talent for delivering heart-felt, heart string tugging stories that leave you feeling like weeping and laughing, all at the same time. I have always felt an amazing spark and connection when reading his books, and The Longest Ride was no different. I always get so lost in his writing, and I found myself soaring through all of the different emotions while listening to The Longest Ride. I felt a great connection to the story! 
 In the past, I have only listened to mystery/suspense novels on audio, so I was quite leery about listening to a non-mystery book on audio, so much so, that I actually put off listening to this book for several months. With this book, I learned that most genres should be okay on audio, that it's not reserved for just mystery books (and be good, at least!) I thought that the narrators, Ron McLarty and January LaVoy, fit their perspective characters perfectly. I really felt like I was listening to Ira when McLarty read! My only quirk would be that LaVoy also read the part of Dylan, so it was a little irking to hear a female try to sound like a manly cowboy! Other than that, I think that the narration of The Longest Ride was great, and if I had to rate it, would rate it at least 4-1/2 stars! 
 I feel like you can never go wrong with Nicholas Sparks, and this book left me feeling no different. It really made me feel like I've been missing a lot in the few years that it's been since I've read a Sparks book. He has a way with words and really delivers some of the best love stories ever written! His stories are impeccable and mesmerizing! And I thoroughly enjoyed reading about both sets of couples, Ira and Ruth, and their life-long love story, which was truly touching, and Sophie and Dylan, who were just beginning their adventure of their love life, where they seem destined to be together! I thought that Sparks expertly intersected the lives of these four people, and brought it altogether at the end. 
 Overall, of all the Nicholas Sparks books that I've read, that this one definitely stands out as one of the most touching stories that he's written. Most retailers compare it to The Notebook, however, I feel like The Longest Ride may even surpass the greatness of The Notebook, which I would have thought was impossible to do! I can't wait to catch up with the Sparks novels that I've missed and see what else he can pull out of his sleeve, because he truly is a remarkable author with astonishing writing abilities!",0.0,0,85021056,3117438.72,0.99,631

The future of the paper looked grim until a young mother was brutally raped and murdered by a member of the notorious Padgitt family. Willie Traynor reported all the gruesome details, and his newspaper began to prosper.
The murderer, Danny Padgitt, was tried before a packed courthouse in Clanton, Mississippi. The trial came to a startling and dramatic end when the defendant threatened revenge against the jurors if they convicted him. Nevertheless, they found him guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison.

1188,The Interestings,Meg Wolitzer,2013,2013,"The Interestings explores the meaning of talent; the nature of envy; the roles of class, art, money, and power; and how all of it can shift and tilt precipitously over the course of a friendship and a life.
The summer that Nixon resigns, six teenagers at a summer camp for the arts become inseparable. Decades later the bond remains powerful, but so much else has changed. In The Interestings, Wolitzer follows these characters from the height of youth through middle age, as their talents, fortunes, and degrees of satisfaction diverge.
The kind of creativity that is rewarded at age fifteen is not always enough to propel someone through life at age thirty; not everyone can sustain, in adulthood, what seemed so special in adolescence. Jules Jacobson, an aspiring comic actress, eventually resigns herself to a more practical occupation and lifestyle. Her friend Jonah, a gifted musician, stops playing the guitar and becomes an engineer. But Ethan and Ash, Jules's now-married best friends, become shockingly successful--true to their initial artistic dreams, with the wealth and access that allow those dreams to keep expanding. The friendships endure and even prosper, but also underscore the differences in their fates, in what their talents have become and the shapes their lives have taken.
Wide in scope, ambitious, and populated by complex characters who come together and apart in a changing New York City, The Interestings explores the meaning of talent; the nature of envy; the roles of class, art, money, and power; and how all of it can shift and tilt precipitously over the course of a friendship and a life.",Fiction,Intermediate,4,11,13,11.75,13,3.54,72841.07344632769,4.0,"I'm not certain what 44 looks like, other than what I'm presented with in the mirror each morning. The Social Security Life Expectancy calculator informs me that I've lived half my anticipated span. The tired maxim encourages me not to think of the years in my life, but the life in my years. 
 Now that I'm marooned in middle age for a spell, I've been thinking an awful lot about the life in the years ahead of and behind me. Have I achieved something of value in my work, my relationships? Is what I do enough to sustain me intellectually and emotionally for the next forty-four years? Do I measure up to my peers? Am I happy? Am I interesting? This quest for fulfillment and self-actualization is the premise of Meg Wolitzer's sprawling, cracking good novel The Interestings. 
 In the summer of '74, Julie Jacobson, a middle class average achiever from a non-descript upstate New York town, earns a spot at an exclusive arts camp in New England. She is selected to enter the inner circle of the five coolest kids in camp, each a precocious, urbane specimen bred in the hipness of New York City. Julie becomes Jules and we follow her and those five other teenagers for the next thirty years. 
 Jules is obsessed with the self-dubbed The Interestings -the talented and/or privileged people to whom she devotes so much emotional energy. The cult of personalities made me squeamish at times--I wanted her to walk away from the past and create a life of her own. But her devotion to their supposed ideal reveals one of the truths of human nature--we hang onto the golden coming-of-age memories, hoping those few perfect moments of childhood will carry us through the disappointment of growing up. 
 It took me a long time to track on the Jules Vibe. I never quite believed in her intimate friendship with Ash Wolf, the faerie child around whose axis the group of friends spins. Nor did I fully embrace Ethan's constancy of passion for her. She just wasn't, ironically, that interesting. Even her physical presence remained shadowy for me. The others I could picture perfectly--lumbering, awkward Ethan; delicate, perfectly formed Ash; bombshell Cathy; finely etched, beautiful Jonah with his sweep of long, dark hair; golden God turned bloated addict Goodman. But Jules, other than her unruly hair, remained indistinct. 
 Yet, as she matured, growing into her role as friend, counselor, wife and mother, Jules begins to take shape. She became the character I most wanted to get stuck in the middle of a book with. Which is the genius of Wolitzer's narrative--the novel's most enigmatic character becomes its core strength. 
 Not that you'll get stuck in this book. Despite its length and scope, The Interestings impels the reader with sparkling dialogue and description. I did tread water with some lengthy expository and flashback episodes, but it easily becomes one of those books you just can't set down. 
 If you say you don't compare your external successes and failures (e.g. material possessions, presumed income, job, weight, health, marital status, kids' college admissions, job prospects) with your circle of peers, I say ""more power to you."" Forgive me if I don't believe you. Meg Wolitzer probably wouldn't believe you, either. It's what we do, we flawed, insecure, fickle humans. We're hard-wired to want what we ain't got. 
 But we can learn to accept what we've been given. Do The Interestings? Read and find out. 
 I'm five years too young to fall within the brackets of the Baby Boomer generation (cut-off birth year is 1964), and ten years younger than the main characters of The Interestings, but I can relate to many of the novel's cultural reference points and Jules Jacobson's feeling that she just missed out on the badge of cultural honor bestowed those who came of age in the late '60s. 
 I've walked away from traditional success a few times, always choosing the interesting over expected. Perhaps because I fear the fall from lofty heights will be harder to recover from than the soft bounce of relative obscurity. Perhaps I'm just lazy.

1647,The Boston Girl,Anita Diamant,2014,2014,"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Red Tent and Day After Night, comes an unforgettable coming-of-age novel about family ties and values, friendship and feminism told through the eyes of a young Jewish woman growing up in Boston in the early twentieth century.
Addie Baum is The Boston Girl, born in 1900 to immigrant parents who were unprepared for and suspicious of America and its effect on their three daughters. Growing up in the North End, then a teeming multicultural neighborhood, Addie's intelligence and curiosity take her to a world her parents can't imagine - a world of short skirts, movies, celebrity culture and new opportunities for women. Addie wants to finish high school and dreams of going to college. She wants a career and to find true love.
Eighty-five-year-old Addie tells the story of her life to her twenty-two-year-old granddaughter, who has asked her ""How did you get to be the woman you are today?"" She begins in 1915, the year she found her voice and made friends who would help shape the course of her life. From the one-room tenement apartment she shared with her parents and two sisters, to the library group for girls she joins at a neighborhood settlement house, to her first, disastrous love affair, Addie recalls her adventures with compassion for the naive girl she was and a wicked sense of humor.
Written with the same attention to historical detail and emotional resonance that made Anita Diamant's previous novels bestsellers, The Boston Girl is a moving portrait of one woman's complicated life in twentieth-century America, and a fascinating look at a generation of women finding their places in a changing world.",Fiction,Intermediate,12,6,15,11.583333333333334,7,3.79,49893.3886509636,3.0,"When Addie Baum's granddaughter asks her how she came to be the woman she is today, Addie embarks on a trek down memory lane. It is now 1985 as she relates her life story to granddaughter Ava, but her story goes back many, many years. Addie, now at the wise age of eighty-five, was born to Jewish-Russian immigrants but was born in America and lived her entire life in Boston. The novel is written in a conversational tone as granddaughter and grandmother bond through the sharing of these vivid memories. Addie's mind is sharp and her storytelling is spirited. 
 Addie had spark and was a real go-getter. This was a struggle for her - her parents had old-fashioned values and often butted heads with Addie. Her mother lived a hard life, did not want to leave her home country, and as a result turned into a bitter woman. Addie could never seem to please her mother and this distressed her but did not crush her spirit. Her mother believed a woman's place was in the home and such phrases as ""Marriage and children are a woman's crown"" were frequently hurled in Addie's direction. When Addie meets Miss Chevalier, her own ambition is stimulated when this forward-looking woman proclaims ""I believe that girls need gumption, too, especially in this day and age. I believe you are a girl with gumption."" So begins Addie's leap into the world of library reading clubs, Saturday clubs, and ""girls camp"" at the Rockport Lodge. Much to her mother's dismay, she joins the ranks of working women. Her mother could grumble all she wanted, but the income from Addie's job made a big impact on the family's financial situation. ""What could she really do? Without what I earned, she would be back to sewing sheets ten hours a day and eating potatoes every night. Money is power, right?"" We learn much about what it was like for a woman earning a living during the years surrounding the 1920s. 
 Addie's story touches on a wide range of topics and historic events including World War I, sexual assault, orphan trains, the flu epidemic, suicide, child labor laws, prohibition, and a slew of others. These subjects were discussed in a manner you would expect between grandmother and granddaughter - with brevity and with the gravity due to such topics, but without too much depth. It was interesting to get a snapshot of such events from Addie's viewpoint. Heartwarming tales of friendship and family were also emphasized, and I really enjoyed those snippets of her narrative. Overall, I would say this is a sweet story, easy to read, and worth your time if you want a light overview of a young woman's life during early 20th century America. I was not truly inspired by the writing itself. Having been a huge fan of Diamant's novel The Red Tent, I perhaps expected a bit more complexity and richness in the prose. However, this read more like a memoir; one which I believe would have been more enjoyable had I listened to rather than read Addie's words. I applauded Addie's independence and enthusiasm for life.",67.0,1,47970240,6152071.2,4.99,1120

940,First Sight,Danielle Steel,2013,2013,"NEW YORK TIMESBESTSELLER
Paris, L.A., and the world of ready to wear fashion provide rich backdrops for Danielle Steel's deeply involving story of a gifted designer whose talent and drive have brought her everything--except the ability to erase her past and trust relationships.
FIRST SIGHT 
New York. London. Milan. Paris. Fashion Week in all four cities. A month of endless interviews, parties, and unflagging work and attention to detail at the semiannual ready to wear fashion shows--the famous pret-a-porter. At the center of the storm and avalanche of work is American Timmie O'Neill, whose renowned line, Timmie O, is the embodiment of casual chic, in fashion and for the home. She has created a business that inspires, fills, and consumes her life.
With an unerring instinct for what the next trend will be, an innate genius for business, tireless labor, and sheer fearlessness, starting from nothing, over two decades Timmie has built an international empire that has brought her enormous satisfaction and success. In a world where humility and compassion are all too rare, her humor, kindness, integrity, and creativity are inspirational. Yet as blessed as she feels by her success, Timmie harbors the private wounds of a devastating childhood and past tragedy. She is too smart, too experienced, and too hurt to want much in her personal life beyond a succession of convenient, very limited relationships. Always willing to take risks in business, she never risks her heart.
But despite her well-ordered and highly controlled world, it turns out that Timmie O'Neill is not immune to magic when it strikes. And it strikes in Paris during Paris Fashion Week, when an intriguing Frenchman comes into her life when she gets sick. At first, Timmie and Jean-Charles Vernier are only patient and physician. They become confidants and friends, corresponding at a safe distance between Paris and Los Angeles once she goes home. There is every reason why they must remain apart. But neither can deny their growing friendship and the electricity that sparks whenever they meet.
First Sightis as complex and compelling as modern life itself. Careers, families, histories, losses, duty, obligation, and fear of losing control and getting hurt. It is a tale of daring to take risks, and losing control just enough to have a life, when the opportunity presents itself. When two very different worlds and strong-willed people collide, everything changes in an instant, as they confront the age-old question of whether to lay oneself bare and risk intimacy--or not. Are they brave enough to face what comes next? And will they do it together or apart?",Fiction,Intermediate,5,4,14,9.8,11,3.482615384615385,2472.9692307692308,2.0,"Does Danielle Steele get paid by the word? There are so many passages and paragraphs that are redundant (especially in the first half), that I feel like Steele is just milking every extraneous description for the dollars she sees in her head. I could have edited out every other paragraph and this novel would have still made sense and moved faster. 
 This is the first Danielle Steele novel I've ever read, and I can't say I'm impressed. 
 The characters are more mature, but that doesn't make their decisions or actions all that reasonable. I like that Timmie O. is an independent, successful businesswoman but she has literally no friends? What does that say about female business leaders? She's climbed the corporate and fashion ladder but has no one to confide in? She has the confidence to build an empire from nothing but has such low self-esteem that she allows herself to be used by vain pretty boys for months? 
 I understand that she's close to her assistants but even they don't seem well drawn out. Jade is a 32-year old who has never heard of or tried Internet dating? It's 2013! Yet she uses an online grocery delivery service? Huh? 
 And the romance with the doctor was too slow to build and almost unbelievable when it happens. They see each other every day for a week, build a close friendship, don't see each other again for months and then see each other again,where nothing happens.

 I took my time leaning over the table, slurped my wine from the rim to spare my white jeans. Never fuck with a rich white bitch and her white jeans. ""Not in her teeth. Up her ass, on the other hand . . ."" 
 Luke's laugh was the standing ovation. He shook his head, impressed. ""You can be pretty vicious, you know?"" 
 This book was sold with a blurb as being ""for fans of Gone Girl."" With all due respect, there is no comparison. It is more The Devil Meets Prada or Four Blondes than anything else. At best, it is the poor man's Gone Girl, a fake $5 knockoff of the original. 
 There is no arguing who is the superior writer. Flynn's words have more power. Knoll's words feel emotionless. Paraphrased. Here is a comparison of two paragraphs. 
 First, Flynn: 
 ""Men always say that as the defining compliment, don't they? She's a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she's hosting the world's biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. 
 Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they're fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men - friends, coworkers, strangers - giddy over these awful pretender women, and I'd want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who'd like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I'd want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn't really love chili dogs that much - no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They're not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they're pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. 
 Now, Knoll: 
 Pretty girls had to appear as though they weren't trying to be pretty, which I had made the fatal mistake of doing at Bradley. There were times Nell went out in her father's polo, nasty old Uggs, and sweatpants, no makeup, just to prove her loyalty resided with her own gender. Pretty girls also had to have a self-deprecating sense of humor and point out when they had a blistering pimple and talk about their explosive diarrhea to assure other girls that they weren't interested in the role of man-eating minx. 
 As you can see, there is no comparison as to whose words are far more effective. 
 This book dealt with some very difficult issues, issues like rape and eating disorders, but it didn't deal with them well. The issues were dealt with dismissively, the narrator discussed them with as much emotion as if she was telling us about her last SoulCycle class. 
 I understand that everyone deals with these issues in a different way. Some dismiss them, try not to think about them. Others dwell on their pain. A good book that deals with these issue tell the story of the character--the victim---in such a way as to make the reader empathize with what they have gone through. However the character deals with their past, be it downright ""I'm going to pretend it never happened"" to ""I can't stop thinking about it. This is killing me,"" the reader should FEEL it. 
 This did not happen in this book. You may argue that this is the main character's way of dealing with things, that I should infer it through her experience. Well, with all due respect, fuck that shit, this is a book. It is not the reader's burden to infer everything. If that's the case, you might as well hand me a blank book with two characters names typed on it and have me infer 600 pages. I don't think so. 
 As a narrator, the main character, the rather unfortunately named TifAni FaNelli, ""Ani"" (pronounced aaaaaaahh-nee), is a highly irritating one. She has one tone: glib. Again, there is zero emotion in anything she describes, from her work, to her past, to her relationships, to her descriptions of the people in her life. 
 Speaking of the people in her life, they are no better. Every single one of them is one-dimensional. Ani herself is materialistic, bitchy, constantly criticizing of others (hint: she doesn't like anyone). All the men in the book are arrogant assholes, easily manipulable if one just say the right things, offer the right promises, offer them that little bit of excitement, be the lady in the living room, the cook in the kitchen, the whore in the bedroom. All the women in the book are competitors. 
 His wife, body mean with Equinox muscles, cheery blond hair swept away from her face in a ninety-dollar blow-out. I always eye the wife first; I like to know what I'm up against. She was wearing the typical Kate uniform: white jeans, nude wedges, and a silky, sleeveless top. Hot pink, I'm sure she spent a few minutes debating it--was she tan enough, maybe the navy silky sleeveless top instead, can't go wrong with navy--and over her shoulder, a cognac Prada the exact same shade as her shoes, the perfect match more age revealing than the skin starting to pucker in her neck. She had at least ten years on me, I determined, relieved. I don't know how I'm going to live with myself when I turn thirty. 
 None of the women eat. They're all medicated up the yin-yang, spray-tanned, Botoxed Bergdorf blondes whose greatest desire in life is the ring, the husband in finance, the designer child, the summer house in Nantucket. The artificiality of it would be humorous, except that everything in this book reeks with tension-filled misery. 
 Ani's life is a giant parade in which she is the showpiece. She is clearly miserable, her life is one of an underfed bird in a gilded cage, and I have no idea why she strives so hard to maintain it. 
 Ani has as much personality as a gluten-free piece of bread. She is ""shocking"" to the upper class, and to the reader, because of her sexual proclivities. Hearing her describe her good qualities is simply pitiful. 
 I'm pretty--I have to work at it, but the raw materials are there. I'm four years Luke's junior, which isn't as good as eight, but still, something. I also like to do ""weird"" things in bed. Even though Luke and I have very different definitions of ""weird"" (him: doggy style and hair pulling, me: electric shocks to my pussy with a ball gag in my mouth to stifle my screams), by his standards, we have a freaky, fulfilling sex life 
 And it's not a pitiful as in ""poor girl, she has so much going for her, but she doesn't realize her full potential,"" as much as it is ""wow, what a sorry excuse for a human being. But really, what's between her legs is more interesting than what's in between her head, which is, frankly, nothing at all. 
 There is a severe disconnect between her and the reader. As a result, I have no empathy for her. I have no emotional connection with her. I do not feel her pain. I find her story boring. I find what happened to her---as atrocious as it was---to be little more than an afterthought. 
 The story is so, so dull. How can a revenge story hold so little interest? Well, read this book, and you will see how. The narrative is disruptive, jumping from her teens to her current ""perfect"" life, and frankly, both timelines bore the fuck out of me.",355.0,1,153951840,54510355.2,9.56,430
1768,Her Fearful Symmetry,Audrey Niffenegger,2009,2009,"Six years after the phenomenal success of The Time Traveler's Wife, Audrey Niffenegger has returned with a spectacularly compelling and haunting second novel set in and around Highgate Cemetery in London.
When Elspeth Noblin dies of cancer, she leaves her London apartment to her twin nieces, Julia and Valentina. These two American girls never met their English aunt, only knew that their mother, too, was a twin, and Elspeth her sister. Julia and Valentina are semi-normal American teenagers--with seemingly little interest in college, finding jobs, or anything outside their cozy home in the suburbs of Chicago, and with an abnormally intense attachment to one another.
The girls move to Elspeth's flat, which borders Highgate Cemetery in London. They come to know the building's other residents. There is Martin, a brilliant and charming crossword puzzle setter suffering from crippling Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; Marjike, Martin's devoted but trapped wife; and Robert, Elspeth's elusive lover, a scholar of the cemetery. As the girls become embroiled in the fraying lives of their aunt's neighbors, they also discover that much is still alive in Highgate, including--perhaps--their aunt, who can't seem to leave her old apartment and life behind.
Niffenegger weaves a captivating story in Her Fearful Symmetry about love and identity, about secrets and sisterhood, and about the tenacity of life--even after death.",Nonfiction,Novice,3,6,14,10.0,9,3.24,57582.972674040335,5.0,"This was difficult to put down but I deliberately tried to read slowly beause it was such a pleasure to read. Niffenegger is one of the finest contemporary writers and noone does longing and stymied love better than she does. 
 This book reminded me of ""Time Traveler's Wife"" as well as ""The Lovely Bones."" The stories center on an apartment building right off of Highgate Cemetery in London. One apartment belongs to Elspeth Noblin who dies on the first page of the book and bequeaths the apartment to her twin nieces in America, with the stipulation that they must live there for a year before selling and that their mother, Elspeth's own twin, can never set foot in the apartment. The top floor apartment is occupied by Martin, who suffers terribley from OCD. Niffenegger's rendering of OCD is the most painful and seemingly realistic depiction that I've come across. Elspeth's somewhat younger lover lives in the first floor apartment and works as a tour guide at Highgate Cemetery. 
 This book is well worth reading BUT you really need to suspend disbelief and just go with the really wild premise. This is part love story, part ghost story, maybe even a little Sci Fi. Suspenseful, surprising, and beautifully written.",68.0,1,19735080,1922325.9,3.79,1120
1715,The Broker,John Grisham,2005,2006,"In his final hours in the Oval Office, the outgoing President grants a controversial last-minute pardon to Joel Backman, a notorious Washington power broker who has spent the last six years hidden away in a federal prison. What no one knows is that the President issues the pardon only after receiving enormous pressure from the CIA. It seems Backman, in his power broker heyday, may have obtained secrets that compromise the world's most sophisticated satellite surveillance system.
Backman is quietly smuggled out of the country in a military cargo plane, given a new name, a new identity, and a new home in Italy. Eventually, after he has settled into his new life, the CIA will leak his whereabouts to the Israelis, the Russians, the Chinese, and the Saudis. Then the CIA will do what it does best: sit back and watch. The question is not whether Backman will survive, there is no chance of that. The question the CIA needs answered is, who will kill him?
From the Hardcover edition.",Fiction,Intermediate,14,1,14,4.714285714285714,3,3.77,57909.78614457831,4.0,"I liked it, but I can see why I've started The Partner about a dozen times and never finished it. Maybe it's because I'm reading a book about romance novels for one of my classes (and thus in the mood for a good romance novel), but I just didn't feel very fulfilled by this book. Don't get me wrong, I loved the story & found it very suspenseful, but part of what makes Grisham's writing so supsenseful is that he's so sparse in his character descriptions, leaving evidence for their motivations to the minimum. Maybe I'm just too ""female"" but I like getting a little more emotionally involved in the lives of the characters I'm reading about. 
 For those of you who have no idea what the story's about: A lame duck President is convinced by the veteran CIA director to grant a pardon to the man involved in THE political scandal of his day. The man they release, ""The Broker,"" has been unwilling to share his secrets with the government, so they release him & help him hide away in Italy while simultaneously leaking his whereabouts to the right people in the hopes that knowing who assassinates The Broker will unravel some of the mystery surrounding the sensitive information that sent him to jail in the first place.

654,The Wedding,Nicholas Sparks,2003,2008,"Simon Steinberg and Blaire Scott are among the most respected couples in Hollywood. They have defied the Hollywood cliche and stayed together for decades. Their three children--teenage aspiring model Samantha, pre-med student Scott, and entertainment lawyer Allegra--are successful and happy. Allegra, as an attorney to the stars, has a career that consumes so much of her energy that she has little time for a private life--until a chance encounter with a New York writer turns her life upside down. Suddenly, she finds herself planning a wedding at her parents' Bel Air home.
As preparations begin, the chaos of last-minute arrangements, surprise announcements and ever-increasing anxiety brings out both the best and the worst in everyone. But while couples in each generation of the Steinberg family struggle with broken vows and new hopes, the real meaning of Allegra's wedding emerges. It is a bridge between the past and the future, an opportunity for reconciliation, forgiveness and new hope for the future--as weddings often are for us all.",Fiction,Intermediate,13,2,15,7.714285714285714,9,3.958346456692913,2306.488188976378,4.0,"This is a typical Danielle Steel novel. I hate to say it, but she does have a sort of ""formula"", or ""style"", for her books, for the most part. I do, however, enjoy reading her books occasionally, in spite of this. The Wedding revolves around Allegra Steinberg, and her Hollywood family. It is really a whirlwind of a book, one major event after another just keeps on happening to Allegra, her family, or one of her clients (Allegra is an entertaiment attorney). It is rather fast paced for the most part, which to me, is pretty typical for a DS novel. I have to say, so much of this is rather unrealistic, the fact that so many major things keep happening, no one person in real life could possibly have all these kinds of things going on in their life. To me, this book has a soap opera feel to it, but I enjoy soap operas, so for me, this was a fairly good read, hence the four star rating (I'm actually giving it 3.75 stars, but you can't indicate that here). Enjoy this if you are a fan of Ms. Steel's books, otherwise, maybe give it a pass.",1.0,0,2364740,2341092.6,0.99,167
978,The Bluest Eye,Toni Morrison,2000,2005,"The Bluest Eyeis Toni Morrison's first novel, a book heralded for its richness of language and boldness of vision. Set in the author's girlhood hometown of Lorain, Ohio, it tells the story of black, eleven-year-old Pecola Breedlove. Pecola prays for her eyes to turn blue so that she will be as beautiful and beloved as all the blond, blue-eyed children in America. In the autumn of 1941, the year the marigolds in the Breedloves' garden do not bloom. Pecola's life does change- in painful, devastating ways.
What its vivid evocation of the fear and loneliness at the heart of a child's yearning, and the tragedy of its fulfillment. The Bluest Eyeremains one of Tony Morrisons's most powerful, unforgettable novels- and a significant work of American fiction.",Fiction,Intermediate,11,3,13,7.818181818181818,11,3.99,96821.05584415584,5.0,"...his mother did not like him to play with niggers. She had explained to him the difference between colored people and niggers. They were easily identifiable. Colored people were neat and quiet; niggers were dirty and loud...The line between colored and nigger was not always clear; subtle and telltale signs threatened to erode it, and the watch had to be constant. 
 While I was not the biggest fan of Morrison's style in this novel, I did fully appreciate the dagger-sharp insight that she brought to the color caste system that is so prevalent in African-American culture, even today. Her dialogue rang so true, I could hear it coming directly out of my mother's mouth, my grandmother's mouth, and those of all of the women who've ever filled our kitchens with raucous communal fun and glum communal tragedy alike. Her use of the Dick & Jane children's books, used for decades to teach children to read (SEEMOTHERMOTHERISVERYNICEMOTHERWILLYOUPLAYWITHJANEMOTHERLAUGHSLAUGHMOTHERLAUGHLA) created a chilling, ironic and staggering contrast between the lives of the whites and those of the blacks in this novel. Shirley Temple, Mary Jane candies, and Jean Harlow hairstyles - you'll find the delicacy of all of them here, both in these characters' reality and in metaphor. While the truth and injustices here were often sobering to read, they were filled with too much truth to rightfully deny or turn away from. 
 I could spend hours discussing this novel. I could quote from it all day, but I won't do that, because the entire read was poignant and so crisply aware of the color line - the how and the why - that there is no one point that can overshadow another in the message that these words aimed to send. This novel is older than I am, and yet it still rings with such verity, with such biting truth and reality. With The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison cut open the existence of both internalized and externalized racism in America and laid it bare and exposed at our feet. For that, she deserves nothing but reverence and applause, so she will always have that from me. 
 Anyone who's ever been in doubt of a color line in Black America should read this book. Anyone who's ever questioned, ""But why can't I say those words when you say them all the time? But why do you still believe that racism exists? Why can't you just get over it - the past is the past?"" should read this book. In fact, just read this book anyway - how about that? :) *****",79.0,1,3455760,10332722.4,2.99,255

Publishers Weekly,Fiction,Intermediate,10,5,10,8.2,10,3.625,43.42857142857143,5.0,"Voyage reads like Whitman and Melville in a drinking contest, recognizing the attraction and dangers of the sea, the highs and lows that come with living on your own terms. Hayden had lived most of his life on a boat. When he lived in France, he lived on a boat in various docks. His love for the sea began at Long Wharf in Boston and Sausalito is where Hayden set his last anchor. NY-born and patrician Bogart had a schooner named Santana, and Hayden had his schooner Wanderer. There is no doubt that Hayden was a flawed man of Lear contradictions: he drank, railed against many things, but it seemed that he distrusted the things that came easy to him...such as acting. He disliked the Hollywood factories for creating illusion; politicians, for perpetuating other illusions and; railed against what he was seeing America become. He was outspoken about his political activism, his drinking and occasional drug use in his interviews with Tom Synder, where he looks like the future Keith Richards, but betrays himself as a writer. Hayden lived his life at odds with the `American dream,' climbing up and down the ladder of success several times over. He was a nonconformist who believed in the examined life. It is impossible not to notice the pattern that just as he was about to touch the brass ring he would walk away; but in the writing he is simply majestic, poetic, and provocative. I'd argue that his prose rivals with the best of the twentieth century's best writers.",4.0,1,382620,1144033.8,2.99,24

 Crichton-mode actived! 
 ;) 
 So, my next novel had to be by Michael Crichton! 
 I went to the bookstore and this one was the first book that I checked and after reading the premise, I found it promising. ;) 
 So, I bought it and started to read it. 
 WoW!!!!!!! 
 Since the beginning I was in shock amalgamated with happiness since the style and mood of the novel was astonishing good. (Of course, by then I hadn't read yet The Andromeda Strain, so the idea of gathering a group of expert scientist to deal with something alien was something new for me :P ) 
 I don't know if happens to you, that sometimes if you are reading a novel that it hasn't being made into a film yet (I read the novel like 5 years before to be poorly adapted to a movie) sometimes I imagined some actor or actress to ""play"" the role of the character in my mind, an amusing thing was by then, in 1993, Sharon Stone was in hype due films like ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Sliver"", so when I imagined some actress to fill my image of Dr. Beth Halperin, I thought in Sharon Stone that she eventually got the role! 
 Honest to God! True story! 
 Curiously, 5 years later, Sharon Stone wasn't in hype anymore so, knowing that she was casted in the role that I pictured in my mind was amusing but odd at the same time. 
 I didn't picture Dustin Hoffman for the role of Dr. Goodman, no offense to Mr. Hoffman, which is an actor that I admired a lot, but I thought in Sean Connery for that character. 
 Anyway, the film was a big dissapointment for me since it was very poor adaptation to such excellent book, so if you ever watched the film and you didn't like it, don't worry, that's normal, 
 but please 
 , if that's the reason that you haven't read this novel yet, 
 please go and read it! 
 (Of course, if you have the luck of not having watched the film, please, PLEASE, don't watch it!) 
 I can assure you that the novel is way, way, 
 WAY 
 , better in infinite ways than that mediocre film. 
 I already mentioned the style and mood of the book, I just want to take the topic again to mention that it was a thrilling experience, since you feel that the story is taken very seriously from the scientific angle. 
 All the journey and process of exploring the alien ship is brilliant, you feel that you are there, down in the bottom in the ocean with them, walking with them. 
 There is a major spoiler in this book, that I won't comment here, don't worry, but please avoid at all costs to know that spoiler if you choose to read the book, since it's that kind of spoilers that if you already knew it before of reading the book, simply you will ruin all the fun of actually reading the book and making the investigation along with the scientist group. 
 If you like sci-fi book and/or techno-thriller novels, this is a 
 GREAT 
 option. 
 Highly recommended.",76.0,1,3244800,22681152.0,6.99,172
